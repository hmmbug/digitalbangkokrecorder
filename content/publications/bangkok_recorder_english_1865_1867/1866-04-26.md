The Young Voyagers;
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
OR, PILOTED BY PROVIDENCE.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Come, Annie, come, Jenny—-sisters.
Come aboard my ship, and we’ll have a
jolly nice sail this afternoon. I’ll be a sea-
captain like my father, and show you how
be sails that big packet ship across the
ocean. Come, girls, get in—-Annie, you
shall be my mate, and little Jeany shall be
cook and steward.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The speaker was a fair-haired, rosycheek-
ed boy, with bright, laughing, blue eyes,
about ten years old, who during his address
was busily engaged in rigging the mast and
sail to a ship’s launch, which was made
fast to the beach in one of those secluded,
picturesque little coves or inlets, with
which the South shore of Long Island, be-
tween Fire Island and Rockaway, is so
pleasantly indented.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The boy’s companions were two little
girls of eight and six years, beautiful as
angels, and so exactly like their brother in
every feature, that they seemed as perfect
copies—-all but the long, sunny ringlets of
his exquisite face.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Annie, the elder girl, bounded lightly on
the boat at her brother’s first invitation,
and began assisting him about the sail.—-
But little Jenny—who was tugging along
a great basket, filled with pies, sweetcakes,
and fruits, which they had brought from a
beautiful cottage not far off, for a little pic-
nic dinner—-hesitated and held back in si-
lence, till her brother urged her again to
get into the boat, when she began to argue
with him thus:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“O, don’t let us go in the boat to-day!
There is so much wind, and we might be
—"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“You are a little coward, Jenny, to be
afraid,” interrupted the young captain im-
patiently. It’s the pleasantest day we
have had in a month; it is so late in the
fall that if we don’t go to-day, I am sure
we shall not get another chance this year.
Come, Jenny, don’t be frightened-—jump
in!”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“O, I’m not at all afraid brother,” and
child as she was, little Jenny’s cheek glow-
ed for a few moments with a deeper vermil-
lion tint at the implied question of her
courage by her brother. “I’m not in the
least afraid, Willie. But you know moth-
er told us we must not go in the boat when
it blows hard; all I’m afraid of is disobey-
ing her.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Then you may come into the boat with-
out fear, sister, for mother told me I might
sail this afternoon, not five minutes before
I left the house.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Yes, I know that Willie; but it was
two hours ago, when it was calm. It blows
a great deal harder now, and I’m sure moth-
er would not like us to go away from the
shore in the boat when there is such a high
wind.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“O, nonsense, Jenny, I have been all a-
bout the cove when it blew a great deal
harder than this. Mother, you know, says
I am the best sailor along the coast, and
just as well able to judge when it’s weath-
er fit to go on a cruise, as she is. Come
sisters, we can’t get drowned, for the water
is so shallow now at ebb tide and with this
west wind, that we could wade anywhere
about the cove.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus persuaded, Jenny passed the basket
to her brother; and then clambering into
the boat herself, she took a seat beside An-
nie, in the stern sheets, and soon the launch
was under weigh.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She was a great, heavy, clumsy boat, as
all her class usually are, with a single lug
sail of heavy canvas, altogether illy cal-
culated for a pleasure craft, but little
Willie Walton managed her with consum-
mate skill, for so young a commander, and
they had made several stretches of the
cove, when as they were passing the inlet
that opened out seawards, Annie’s eyes
rested on the bright, blue waves of the
Atlantic, far out beyond the discolored
water along the coast, and clapping her
hands with a certain ectacy of infantile
joy, she exclaimed:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“O’ Willie, Willie ! Let us go out there
and sail on that beautiful, blue ocean !
Won’t it be grand! So much prettier than
this little, dirty cove, with the sand banks
all about us.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Willie sprang to his feet, and gazing out
into the offing, his bright eyes lit up with
the enthusiasm caught from his sister’s
words, and he instantly replied:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“We’ll go out there, and have a glorious
sail—just like the great ships and steam-
boats, that we see go by.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“O, don’t go out brother,” interrupted
little Jenny, her cheek growing pale as the
delicate lily. “Don’t Willie! Mother will
be angry with us.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Mother will do no such thing, Jenny.
She will be proud of us, to think we have
been out on the ocean all alone. I can
easily come back with the flood tide, that
will soon be coming in.” And without far-
ther argument, the reckless boy put his
helm up, eased off the sheet, and away
out through the inlet, towards the line of
blue water outside, went the launch, hur-
ried along before the strong breeze, which
added to the last quarter ebb bore her
away at a speed that soon sunk the yellow
ridge to a mere line along the margin of
the wide ocean, and the white cottages
with the Venetian blinds, into toy houses
dotted with bright green spots. The color-
ed water which appeared from the cove
only like a narrow strip dividing the white
surf from the deep azure of the ocean be-
yond—-expanding into a broad belt of se-
veral miles in width. But with the fine
breeze and the strong outset of the tide,
the boat sped on ; while the novelty of
their position, and the natural excitement
induced by it, caused the space and time
to pass unheeded by the young voyagers.
And a certain dread came upon them,
having gained the blue water, they looked
toward the shore and saw hills, fields,
houses, and orchards, blending, growing
indistinct, and fading away in the distance.
There was a sense of lonely, utter help-
lessness suddenly shadowing their bright
visions; and there was a world of pathos
in little Jenny’s sweet, low voice as she
laid her hand gently on her brother’s arm,
and looking up in his eyes, whispered:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“O, Willie, let us go home. Mother
would feel very bad, if she knew we had
come away out here.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Willie bent down his head and kissed
his sister’s fair pale cheek, as he replied:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“We will go back home, Jenny, I was
naughty to come off so far from land. But
don’t cry, sister. I am very sorry. Don’t
blame me—I couldn’t help it ; I do love the
sea so much.” “No, we won’t blame you
Willie, only let us hurry back ; for see,
yonder is a black cloud coming up in the
west, and I’m afraid if we do not—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The child’s speech was interrupted by a
groan of anguish from her brother, whose
eyes for the first time had been directed
towards a bank of dark, murky clouds,
heaving up in the western horizon, by his
sister’s remark ; and at the very instant
that his vision first rested upon the black
pall, a chain of heavy, zigzag lightning
rose quivering along its upper edge, and a
few moments later there came to their
ears the low muttering roar of far-off
thunder.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The young captain had hauled his little
vessel by the wind, but the clumsy thing
lay broad off under her ill-fitted sail. Be-
sides, the wind, which she had scarcely
felt while running off before it, had now
increased so much that she heeled over
till there was great danger of her capriz-
ing, to prevent which Willie, with the as-
sistance of his two sisters, set about reef-
ing the sail.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This was soon accomplished, and again
the boat was steered as close as she would
go, which at best was little better than
eight points, so that with her great lee
way, Willie soon found that in spite of
his utmost skill, his craft was drifting
rapidly out to sea.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nearer and nearer rolled on the embat-
tled regions of black storm clouds. Loud-
er came the fearful thunder crashes ; more
vivid gleamed the red lightning’s flash ;
wilder the shrieking gale went by, howling
and screaming dread notes of terror to the
young voyagers. The water—-which in
with the land was quite smooth—-began to
heave up in huge, foam crested waves,
here and there, all round them, curling
ever and breaking all feather like in long
lines of showy, hissing spray. Great round
drops of rain came pattering down in the
water and pelting down on the thwarts
and gunwales of the boat, with a sharp
clicking noise that smote startlingly dis-
mal on the ears of the little ocean wanderers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Young as he was, Willie retained in his
mind much of what he had heard his fa-
ther relate at various times, in regard to
the management of a ship in a gale ; and
the knowledge he had thus gained in the-
ory, now stood him in good stead. He had
heard of keeping a ship before the wind
in a squall, and of scudding in a gale—-
and the dull-sailing, clumsy boat was his
ship. The theory which he had learned,
he proceeded to put into practice ; and
when the first mad gust fell upon the
launch, she was going dead before the
wind—-otherwise, her sail would have
blown away, or she would have been
swamped in an instant. As it was, she
went flashing on through the wild storm
and screaming surges, scudding away
right out into the mighty wilderness of
waters.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Ten, fifteen minutes went by, and still
the war of the elements went on in all
their terrible fury; and still the brave lit-
tle fellow stood there at the helm, bare
headed, his cap blown away, his clothes
dripping with water, and steady to his
purpose, steered his tiny bark on and
away, before the fierce, howling blast.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Once, only, he faltered; and that was
when the launch quivered for a moment
on the crest of a mighty surge, and then
went reeling and plunging, standing al-
most on end, down into the hissing vortex
of the liquid ravine. Then, a single quick
cry of horror escaped the boy's lips;
but the next moment Jenny crept up to
his side, laid her head upon his shoulder
and spoke in a low, soothing tone, that
almost instantly called back his confidence,
and elicited from his lips a cry of admi-
ration for his sister's heroism.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Don't be frightened, dear Willie," said
the little angel. "Mother says that God
watches over people that live on the seas.
And don't you remember, brother, how of-
ten our dear mother has told us, that Jesus
loves little children? If God watches o-
ver us, and Jesus loves us, we shall be
safe. So, don't be afraid."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Night—dark, wild, and gloomy night,
came down upon the world of waters, and
still the terrible tornado raged in all its
horrors of wild lightning, rain, and thun-
der; and there in their frail, open boat, we
leave our young voyagers speeding on and
away right into the very heart of the vast
Atlantic. We will bid them adieu, and
glance back to their home—to their fond
mother, rendered desolate in heart by the
dread calamity that had befallen her in
the loss of her children. At the moment
when the children first embarked, Mrs.
Walton had glanced outwards to the cove,
and for a few moments she watched them
with all a mother's fond pride, as she saw
them sailing to and fro on the quiet wa-
ters of the bay; and then some visitors
called, and she forgot her children till just
as the storm came down, when a neighbor
came rushing in with the heart rending in-
telligence that they had been seen only a
few moments previously, several miles out
to sea.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first terrible shock almost killed her;
but soon rallying all her woman's energy
and motherly love, she rushed forth from
her home, and regardless of the furious
storm, aroused the neighbors, and besought
them with all the eloquence called up by
the deep anguish of her heart to lend their
aid in the recovery of her lost darlings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There was no vessel at Rockaway or Fal-
kner's Island, and to venture out to sea in
a storm with such small craft as were kept
along the shore were worse than madness;
and so immediate dispatches were sent to
New-York, not only to the owners of the
ship commanded by Capt. Walton, but to
the pilots; and within an hour after the
news had reached the city, two of the staun-
chest pilot-boats manned by extra picked
crews of gallant souls were under weigh,
and spreading on their swift-winged
course in search of the ocean-lost children.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mrs. Walton herself hastened to the city
to urge with her presence and influence,
more prompt action; but the two ves-
sels had been gone about an hour when
she arrived, and so she repaired to the house
of Mr. Alwin, the owner of the ship her hus-
band commanded, to await the return of
those who had so nobly gone in that mad
storm in search of her three darlings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Leaving her there in a state of fevered
anxiety, hoping in the very teeth
of despair, we, too, will go forth into the
wild yelling gale, to look upon a most sub-
lime ocean picture.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was an hour past midnight—-dark as the
deepest, gloomiest cells of an inquisitorial
dungeon, save when the vivid lightning's
flash lit up the Cimmerian blackness with
a glare rivaling that of the brightest noon-
day sun.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some ninety miles to the eastward of
Sandy Hook lay Hove to a noble ship, in-
ward bound, in one of the most terrible
gales that ever swept along the northern
coast of America. The gale had just set in
an hour before sundown, and ever since
the ship had been hove to under the short-
est possible canvas, heading up southwest,
with the gale coming in violent squalls out
at due north-west.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Do you think there is any danger to us
or to the ship, captain?" inquired one of
the three passengers, who stood near the
commander of the ship, partly sheltered
from the storm by the projecting roof of
the round house.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Not in the least, Mr. Kinsley. You are
as safe here as you would be in your own
house in New-York. She is a bran-new
ship, and I have had no opportunity of
trying her hove to before; but I am per-
fectly satisfied with her behavior. In
fact, I never saw a craft conduct herself as
well in a hurricane like this. 'Tis a terri-
ble night, however, and God help those
who may chance to be out in a less able
craft than ours! For the last hour I have
been thinking of my wife and children.
My wife will not sleep one wink to-night,
she never can in a storm like this when I
am not at home. I was cast away once on
the Long Island shore in just such a gale,
only it was south-west. I would give a
hundred dollars this moment to be at home
only for my wife's sake.—-But we must—-
my God, what is that?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A continuous flash of lightning lit up
the surrounding space, and as the darkness
shut in again, a faint, but clear and dis-
tinct—-"Ship ahoy!" uttered either by a
female or a child, came down on the blast
from directly to windward.{{< /news/text >}}

<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}A moment after the hail was repeated,
and another flash of lightning revealed a
boat driving square down before the gale,
and almost under the ship's quarter. Ere
one could count five, the shrill, quivering
cry came up from the boat, as it shot past
the ship not three fathoms clear of the rud-
der.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Merciful heaven! There are three chil-
dren!” yelled Mr. Kinsley, who with the
captain was peering down over the taffrail
as the boat flew past.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Hard up your helm, my man,” said the
captain in a voice as calm as man's could
be; and then calling to the chief and third
mates who were both on deck, he informed
them of the fact that a small, open boat,
with three children in it, had just gone
past, and then gave his orders :{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Mr. Casey, please go out on the flying
jib boom, and keep a lookout for the boat;
and mind, Mr. Casey, if we come up with
it, you can lay the ship so as to bring the
boat close aboard on the larboard side—-
LARBOARD, remember. Mr. Casey. Don't
for your life make a mistake. Go forward
now, sir, and if we save those children, five
hundred dollars shall be your reward.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Then turning to the chief mate, he con-
tinued :{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Mr. Winsor, you will brace the yards
all square, which without making any sail
will send the vessel through the water
something faster than the boat is going.—
Having done this, rig six single whips, two
on each of the lower yards, on the LAR-
BOARD side. Place the blocks far enough
out for the falls to drop about a fathom
clear of the ship, and reeve off good snug
sail gear, bring both ends in on deck, with
a running bowline in one part and the oth-
er lod along as a foil, stationing three good
fellows at each. In the meantime, I will
get her steady before the wind, and Frank,
my man, you keep her so. Don't let her
yaw an inch. Steer her as though your
very soul depended upon it ; and within an
hour after the ship reaches New-York, you
shall have a hundred dollars.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“And now, Mr. Kinsley, will you please
call up the second mate and all the gen-
tleman passengers ! I want them to stand
by the whips in order to assist the sailors
if necessary. We must save those child-
ren, and do it too without the boat coming
in contact with the ship, as that would be
instant destruction of it and them in such
a sea.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“All ready, the whips, sir!” came from
the mate, and that moment the young
mate's voice rang out from the jib boom
end, “boat right ahead! Steady as you go!”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Now then, my lads, who'll go into these
running bowlines with me, and stand by to
pick up the children?” anxiously inquired
the captain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“I sir,” “I,” “I,” came from a dozen
ready sailors in a moment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Thank you, my lads; but I only want
five. I will go in one of the bowlines my-
self.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The selections were soon made, and there
they stood in the fore, main and mizzen
chains—the commander and five noble fel-
lows—with the bowlines under their arms
ready to risk their lives to save the three
children.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Steady! stand by, now! Here they
come!—look out!” screamed the officer
from the jib boom, and a moment later the
dim outlines of a boat, loomed up by the
lee cat-head. Another of breathless ex-
pense, and the boat was abreast of the fore
chains.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Stand by the forward whips! Look out
there in the main chains! Veer away
men! now, Harry, Now!” and down went
the captain and his companion, down into
the boat.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A breath later, and the shout came ring-
ing up, “Look out, main and mizzen chains!
Sway away, on deck!” and up by the run
came the two men, each grasping a child
in his arms.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Main chains, there! In God's name,
have you got her!” screamed the captain,
rushing aft with the boy he had saved still
in his arms.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Ay, ay, sir! All right,” answered a
brave fellow, clambering in on the deck
with little Jenny grasped tight by her
clothes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Father!” exclaimed the little girl, clasp-
ing the captain about the neck. “Father!
Father!” echoed back two treble voices.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Almighty God, I thank thee! Saved—
saved—saved!” and Capt. Lester Walton
sunk fainting on the deck. He knew the
children were his own from the moment
they passed the ship's stern, and his indom-
itable self-control had borne him up till
they were rescued; when the reaction came
he sank down insensible.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At an hour before sunset on the follow-
ing day, the ship was at her berth in New
York, and the meeting between the dis-
tracted mother and her loved children
there, in the cabin of her husband's ship,
is too sacred a picture to be profaned by a
mere pen-and-ink copy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/right >}}
The Youths Friend
{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}If such an intense effort to save the tem-
poral life of those three children be most
suitable, praiseworthy, and sublime, how
much more so is the whole hearted and per-
sistent efforts to save souls from eternal death
unto eternal life.{{< news/indent4 >}}Ed.{{< /news/text >}}

The Highlander's Prayer.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Scotch Highlander, who served
in the first disastrous war with the
American colonies, was brought one
evening before his commanding officer,
charged with the capital offense of be-
ing in direct communication with the
enemy. The charge could not, well
be preferred at a more dangerous time.
Only a few weeks had elapsed since
the execution of Major Andre and the
indignation of the British exasperated
almost to madness by the event, had
not yet cooled down. There was,
however, no proof against the High-
lander. He had been seen, in the
grey of the twilight, stealing out from
a clump of underwood that bordered
on one of the huge forests, which then
covered much the greater part of the
United Provinces, and which, in the
immediate neighborhood of the British,
swarmed with the troops of Washing-
ton. All the rest was mere inference
and conjecture. The poor man's de-
fence was summed up in a few words.
He had stolen away from his fellows,
he said, to spend a few hours in private
prayer.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Have you been in the habit of
spending hours in private prayer?"
sternly asked the officer, himself a
Scotchman and a Presbyterian.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Highlander replied in the af-
firmative.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Then," said the other, drawing
out his watch, "never in your life had
you more need of prayer than now;
kneel down, sir, and pray aloud, that
we may all hear you."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Highlander, in the expectation
of instant death, knelt down. His prayer
was that of one long acquainted with
the appropriate language in which the
Christian addresses his God. It breath-
ed of imminent peril, and earnestly
implored the Divine interposition in
the threatened danger, the help of
Him who in times of extremity is
strong to deliver. It exhibited, in
short, a man who, thoroughly con-
versant with the scheme of redemp-
tion, and fully impressed with the
necessity of a personal interest in the
advantages which it secures, had made
the business of salvation the work of
many a solitary hour, and had, in con-
sequence, acquired much fluency in
expressing all his various wants as they

Little Things.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Great virtues are rare; the occasions
for them are very rare; and when they
do occur, we are prepared for them—
we are excited by the grandeur of the
sacrifice, we are supported either by
the splendor of the deed in the eyes
of the world, or by the self-com-
placencey that we experience from the
performance of an uncommon action.
Little things are unforeseen; they come
in contact with our pride, our indol-
ence, our haughtiness, our readiness to
take offense; they contradict our in-
clinations perpetually. We would
much rather make certain great sac-
rifices to God, however violent and
painful they might be, upon condition
that we should be rewarded by liberty
to follow our own desires and habits
in the details of life. It is, however,
only by fidelity in little things that a
true and constant love to God can be
distinguished from a passing fever of
spirit.—Fénelon.{{< /news/text >}}

The Siam Telegraph.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The concession of the permission to
make the Telegraph from Rangoon to
Singapore, and the regulations under
which it has been granted, have been
approved and signed by the Siamese
authorities, and Mr. Read has left on
his return to Singapore. We wish
him every success in the undertaking
he is engaged in, as it is one on which
depends much of the future commer-
cial prosperity and political security
of this country, and we shall be in-
deed glad to hear that the British Go-
vernment has taken a favorable view
of the subject. We understand that
the rulers of the tributary states un-
der the rule of Siam, through which
the line may pass, must be consulted,
and their approbation obtained, but
this should prove no impediment to
the successful termination of the
scheme, as the approval of the sup-
reme government at Bangkok, if pro-
perly represented to those chieftains,
must ensure their compliance and we
therefore, confidently expect that a
representative of the Company will
be here before long, empowered to
secure the ratification of all agree-
ments, and to commence operations.{{< /news/text >}}

Naturalization.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following is a postscript that should
have been appended to the article on na-
turalization which appeared in the pre-
vious number. {{< news/indent4 >}} Ed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With respect to naturalization it
has been brought to our notice that,
the French Missionaries contend that
His Majesty the Emperor has taken
all Roman Catholics in these countries
under his protection, and therefore
that they have a right to the good
offices of the French Consul. This
argument would be very appropriate
in a time of religious persecution; but
where the utmost freedom in the prac-
tice of different creeds exists, and is
guaranteed by Treaty, it cannot be ad-
mitted; and a native christian, is as
liable to the laws of his country, and
can no more change his allegiance to
his King, than the Buddhist or Maho-
medan. The teachers of the people
should ever remember that they have
been instructed by high authority to
"render unto Cæsar the things which
are Cæsar's," and as they teach so
should they practice.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Our Buddhist Champion
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Translated from the Siamese.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In reply to our article in No. 14.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As regards the subject of religion on
which much has been written and
published, we have no desire to lift up
any religion and endeavor with it
to overthrow Christianity, because we
are aware that religion is a thing by
which men get a livelihood among
all the religious sects that exist, the
same as men resort to paddy fields
and orchards for a living. But to tell
the truth, the heart is one way and
the mouth another. The mouth will
speak in praise of a religion which it
holds as its own. And to be honest,
we must say that men according to
the wisdom they have are necessarily
incredulous of Christianity, and hence
ask many questions about it for in-
formation, and if you do not answer
their questions their doubts will not be
solved. If instead of answering their
questions directly to the point, you give
evasive answers, lugging in irrelevant
matter, you do thus cover up and
hide the point in question. For in-
stance we put to you some questions
about the rainbow, the sacred bow
and arrow of God; you did not at-
tempt to answer our questions, and
logged in the subject of lions and other
stories evincing a delirious mind. To
answer your antagonist in this way is,
according to an old proverb, said
to "be taking the side and pushing
his fellow." It is like two persons
tisting. One uses his fist in the pro-
per way, another instead of using his fist
suddenly turns his side, and with it
pushes his antagonist against the wall.
Now this is what the Siamese denom-
inate pushing with the side. The per-
son who thus meets his combatant
in argument virtually despises, and
ridicules him greatly. Even the
sacred books condemn the practice of
evasion in argument, saying, "whoever
being enquired of for information,
brings forward irrelevant matter for
an answer, and for the purpose of
burying up the point in question is
guilty of pushing his enquirer away
from him, thus revealing clearly that
he is an angry and captious man."
Such persons fall under the charge of
being given to fault finding and scoof-
fing. Such conduct is in no sense be-
coming.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now as regards the idea that vast
numbers of Siamese will sink into hell
because their king is leading them
thither—-why do you speak of it? The
king of Siam is causing many very
many to go down to hell is he? Why
do you not rather speak of the lord
Jesus as causing innumerable hosts to
go to hell! To illustrate our meaning.
When Jesus rose from the dead it is
recorded of him that he secretly ap-
peared to his apostles whom he loved—-
that he came and went stealthily
showing himself to only one or two at
a time, thus conducting himself as a
ghost does when it appears unto men—-
never appearing unto great multitudes
at once. Now why was this! Do you
think such conduct was suitable in
one professing to be Almighty? A
God like this was it, who became
famed for his power to make an atone-
ment for sin, and to bear the sins of
the whole world in the place of sinners?
Boasting as he did that he was the
one propitiatory sacrifice for the sins
of the world, why did he conduct him-
self thus?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The early teachings and history of
the Teacher (Jesus) and the teachings
of his followers who go about preach-
ing Christianity at the present time—-
praising and glorifying Christ, do not
agree together. The early and latter
teachings do not harmonize.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again when it is said that Jesus came
into the world and went about preach-
ing the gospel an indefinite period of
time, and that he then ascended to
heaven, how are we to learn where
heaven is—whether above or below, at
the west or the east, at the north or the
south? And when he ascended, why
did he ascend from a forest of trees
where only a few could see him? Why
did he not go up, and sail about in mid
heaven so that the multitudes could be-
hold him: or fly around the world three
times or seven times, and thus display
himself to all men, and give all the
privilege of hearing his teachings in
all parts of the habitable world! Could
he not have done this! Had he done
it, it would have been in accordance
with the fame which his modern fol-
lowers proclaim of him, and would
show that he is indeed the true God,
able and willing to save all the world
from sin and from hell, and take them
all to heaven. Had he displayed such
power at that time, giving all the in-
habitants of the world to see and hear
him at once, would not all the world
have been converted to him long ere
this! and would there be now any
more necessity of going about evan-
gelizing the nations with great labor,
and great expense of paper and book-
making! Had he taken this course
all mankind would have become be-
lievers in Christianity without any
sectarianism, and hence would all go
to heaven, not one being left to sink
to hell.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again the Roman Catholic Teach-
ers and Protestant missionaries be-
lieve in and pray to Jesus in heaven
praying to him day and night without
ceasing as being the most High and
the most excellent One. Still they do
not agree together; but quarrel about
the doctrines of Christ. The Protes-
tants speak against the Roman Catho-
lics and reproach them, affirming that
they hold many religious tenets
which are not taught in the Bible, that
their teachings are not in harmony
with the law of God, that they have
introduced into their system of doc-
trines commandments of their own
which are not of God. As for exam-
ple they teach that men ought to
worship the image of Jesus and of his
mother, and have established customs,
and hold them sacred which the Bible
does not sanction. As for the Roman
Catholics they find fault with the
Protestants charging them of being
rebels against the religion of Jesus
following their own unscriptural ways.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus do the two sects reproach and
quarrel and hook each other like cattle.
Now where is he whom they adore as
God? Does he know how they treat
each other? Both sects profess to hold
and observe the instructions of the
Lord Jesus, and seek him by prayer, and
supplication every morning and even-
ing. Now it would seem suitable that
he whom they thus worship should
make both parties to see and feel alike
so that they no more reproach and
hook one another.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why do you say that God nourish-
es and sustains the world in all its
parts and particular? Where is he
that no one can see him? If he knows
all men and knows that all his follow-
ers love and adore him greatly, why
does he not manifest himself to them so
that they shall see him clearly? As
to other sects holding different views
of the christain religion we have no
occasion to say anything, because they
are far away from us. But Protes-
tants and Roman Catholics are living
among us and therefore we have sin-
gled them out in our remarks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now for the above reasons we stand
in great doubt of the christian reli-
gion. Persons who have indeed some
wisdom disagree greatly about the re-
ligion which they mutually hold and
practice very differently. The Catho-
lics and Protestants are agreed in go-
ing about cursing all others who are
not christians, saying that the king is
levying the people en masse and lead-
ing them down to hell. Who will be
the cause of their destruction? Will
it not be attributable to Jesus and
those who bear his name? It is Je-
sus himself who causes men to go to
hell. It is the teachers of his religion
that lead men thither, because they
do not show good evidence as they
should of the truth of what they af-
firm. They do not show that which
corresponds with the cause, with the
fruit, with the beginning or the end.
The religion of Jesus is like unto
Children calling to one another in
sport-—O children children! it is late
and you are not yet asleep. Let the
tookaas come and eat out your livers!
There is no profit in using religion as
a thing to sport with in this way. Is
not religion a means for gaining alivi-
hood? What man who has any know-
ledge of mankind, and has seen any-
thing, does not know that every reli-
gion, whether false or true, is in the
beginning started and propagated by
tradition, and that men coming after-
wards take it up and carry it and put
their trust in it. And finally they fall
to speaking invidiously of other per-
sons saying—-this man is a believer,
that man is an unbeliever, people of
that sect will go to hell, people of this
sect will go to heaven. Now where
shall we get any light to show us
where hell is, or where heaven is?
Who knows? Who among men has
seen the one or the other that he
should feel authorized to speak thus of
either? It is all in vain thus to talk.{{< /news/text >}}

Domestic Animals of Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
CHAPTER II.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}As our former chapter was on the
interesting subject of Dogs so this, to
be in due order, must be on the scarce-
ly less interesting topic of Cats.
These highly domesticated animals are
not nearly as numerous as the canine
tribes, yet the habitations of men in
Siam seem to be quite overrun with
them, being in far greater proportion
to the people than you will find in
Europe or America. They would ap-
pear to be full as prolific as their
neighbors the dogs, but the latter so
tyrannize over them as to prevent an
equal increase. As in all parts of the
world so in Siam it is natural for dogs
to tease cats by barking and growling
at them, and on the other hand for
cats to attempt to hold their peculiar
rights under the table, in the sink
room, and all over the house by grow-
ling back with hair all on end and
then in a favorable moment, in the
twinkling of an eye pitch into their
faces giving them a terrible scratch-
ing. A strange dog cannot stand such
treatment however powerful he may
be at his own home. A little mother
cat will send any such creature out
of doors in a jiffy with terrible cry-
ing for mercy. But dogs when they
come to feel at home at any place,
gradually get the upper hand of the
cats, especially, if they are pinched
with hunger, and will pitch upon them
with terrible and destructive vengeance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Siamese love cats much more than
dogs. The latter are regarded as having
a vicious nature, the former as being
meek, gentle, and loving. The people
have many superstitious notions about
cats, handed down both by tradition
and books. They are highly regard-
ed, not for their mousing propensities,
but for the superstition that in some
mysterious way they bring prosperity
to the family which nourishes them.
And there is a great choice in them
for this end. The possession of a
silver colored cat is accounted one of
the best insurances for future pros-
perity. A black cat with nine white
spots upon it in the right places is ac-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}counted a great prize. The spots must
be placed one on each foot, one on
the forehead, one on the neck,
one on the belly one on the back and
one on the tail. A cat with more
white spots than these, but not pro-
perly located has no particular mer-
it. A jet black cat with black claws
is accounted one of the very best,
but such are rarely if ever found. It is
strange that the Siamese with all their
veneration of the white Elephant,
white monkeys, white squirrels, white
crows, etc., should evince a great dis-
like of white cats; and this too, we
are informed, because they are prone
to lead their owners into misfor-
tune. Consequently such cats every
where meet with great neglect and
sometimes with cruel treatment from
even Buddhists.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is affirmed and believed that cats
are sometimes not only pledges of
good to their owners, but positively
bring good things to them. As for
example it is said a good cat will
sometimes go to a neighbor's house
or boat and stealthily bring away a
purse of money and lay it down at
her owners feet. Such deeds would
of course be enough to establish the
notion that cats of the right stamp are
invaluable living pledges of "better
times coming" to the families with
which they are connected.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some cats are highly prized because
of some peculiarity about the lens of
their eyes which their owners fancy
are "pearls of great price" in the
process of forming. Some of the lens
appear to be bluish, some greenish,
and others white. Not long since a
Siamese Prince of high rank sent a
cat to us for examination, wishing to
learn our estimation of the pre-
cious stones that had been formed in
his eyes. We had a look at the crea-
ture much in the style of an Ophthal-
mic surgeon, and found both lenses
simply opaque and consequently the
eyes were blind in the day time with
a little improvement in the evening,
being precisely the symptoms of a
common cataract of the eye. It
seemed to be quite a sad disappoint-
ment even to those sereants of the
Prince, to hear our opinion that there
was no value in the two white
pearls in the cats eyes. It appears
that the Siamese never kill the cats
to get these jewels, but wait patiently
until the creature dies a natural death,
and then watchfully wait for the de-
composition of the eyes until they
can at leisure disengage them from the
mass of putrifaction. Such relics are
preserved with the greatest care as
having power to protect the possessor
against evil spirits and deadly wounds
from enemies. They are often set in
a little gold frame, somewhat as a pre-
cious stone is set in a finger ring, and
then by means of a string around the
waist worn over the stomach as an
amulet. It is believed that the best
of these stones will render a man in-
vulnerable to swords, daggers and
even to gun shot. Who knows but
the Siamese soldiers under Nai Pan
the Siamese Ambassador in Paris
in 1660 had something of the kind
about them?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is a peculiar propensity in
Siamese cats to be born with a mal-
formation of their tails. The tail is
short at the best, and the end of it for
an inch or more is crooked almost at
right angles and remains permanently
so. It is a great deformity, but one
which some Europeans seem to re-
gard as an evidence of a good mouser.
The Siamese themselves have no par-
ticular love or hatred for such tails.
An American sea-faring wag, a year
or two since, hit upon quite an appro-
priate name for such cats. He called
them the crochet cat because their
tails were somewhat in the shape of a
crochet needle.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to mousing propensities, Siam-
ese cats never have any because they
seldom if ever see a mouse to catch.
But they have no want of employ-
ment in catching rats, for they are
ever abundant and yet we must say
that they appear to go at this their
proper business, generally, with very
little spirit. Perhaps it arises from
their having been brought up and
educated in a Buddhist country where
animal killing is quite disreputable!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a very rare occurrence for a
cat to be killed by a direct intention
of a Buddhist. The horror of killing
them is much greater than that of
dogs. The reason of this seems to be,
that they are regarded as being far
more valuable to man as pledges of
temporal good than dogs, and be-
cause they seldom do any thing to
arouse the anger of man. They ap-
pear so amiable and loving, that it is
like pulling teeth for Buddhists to
raise their hands against, them. If at
any time they become troublesome by
their great numbers in a house,
they are picked up and carried away
blind-folded to a distant temple or
homestead, and there turned out to
seek a living as best they can among
utter strangers. We not unfrequent-
ly find on a evening or early in
the morning one or two kittens cast
as foundlings at our door; and a dirty
white cat an utter stranger, miserably
emaciated is just now trying to ingra-
tiate himself into our favor. But he
has to stand afar off from our mother
cat and her aristocratic family old and
young. There has already been sev-
eral terribly snarling fights between
them, and the stranger has been
thoroughly beaten and gone to
seek refuge with our neighbor, who,
strange to say, had no old settlers to
hinder his entering quietly in.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}[He was permitted to remain until
his thieving propensities led him into
the cookhouse, where he found a chick-
en all ready for dinner, and helped
himself to the whole of it, when he
was forcibly expelled by being pitch-
ed into the nearest temple grounds. G.]{{< /news/text >}}

Spring and the Tamarind
Tree.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Tamarindus indica)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Though our dry season is continuing
beyond the usual bounds, with quite
an uncommon absence of showers at
the vernal equinox and with extraor-
dinary heat, it is nevertheless a spring
time for very many of our trees which
have deep roots. It is quite cheering to
look upon the new dresses with which
they are now coming out. Tamarind
trees, especially, are to us exquisitely
beautiful. We have nine or ten of
them in our door yard. These trees
when planted in rather isolated lo-
calities uniformly take charming forms,
having a short trunk with magnificent
branches arranged with the greatest
disorder, but with the most pleasing
variety of wildness. The trees which
we planted fourteen years since when
not more than an inch in diameter two
feet above the ground, are now sixteen
inches at the same hight. This rapid
growth will indicate the great strength
of this soil. And it should be borne
in mind that the wood of the Tamarind
is as hard and close grained as that of
an apple tree, and not any of your
soft timber which naturally grows
with the rapidity of a sugar cane.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The trunks of our Tamarind trees
are not more than six feet high, at
which elevation the trees divide off in-
to many crooked yet smooth limbs,
standing outward and upward at such
angles as to form a uniform hemisph-
erical top, about 90 feet in circumier-
ence, extending upward in a most
beautiful curve from 15 to 20 feet from
the top of the trunk.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The largest Tamarind trees that we
have seen in Siam would not, probably,
measure more than four feet through 6
feet from the ground, with trunks less
than 20 feet high,and tops superseded
extending upward to the hight of 50
or 60 feet.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The usual appearance of the Tam-
arind foliage is much like that of the
locust tree of America, but with a
smaller and more delicate leaf and a
richer green. Twenty eight or thirty
leaflets an inch long and a quarter
broad grow on one leafstalk, and from
10 to 20 leafstalks on one of the smal-
lest branches. The new leaves now
unfolding are exquisitely delicate and
beautiful, displaying a variety of tints
as the purple, the pink, the red and
the pea-green.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The time occupied in casting off
the old leaves is not usually more than
a fortnight, and some times less than
that. It is curious to observe the per-
fect harmony among the trees in
changing their livery without any ap-
parent external influence like that of
a blast from frost to force them to it.
You may see the trees in the morning
quite thickly covered with old leaves.
A little brush of wind or a dash of
rain will in less than an hour precip-
itate the most of them to the ground,
and display all of a sudden the beauti-
ful new dress that had till their been
quite hidden. And you will be sur-
prised to observe then, for the first
time, charming clusters of pink and
red flower buds, and even blossoms
already developed. These are of the
general form of pea flowers, but much
smaller and more delicate, their petals
being penciled with yellow, pink, and
purple on a ground work of pearly
white.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The fruit of the Tamarind is a large,
crooked, and rough pod from four to six
inches long and less than one in diam-
eter. It requires about ten months to
bring the pods to perfection. When ripe,
the seed and pulp are quite loose and
rattle in the dry pod which has then
become a brittle shell. The natives
are very fond of the fruit in a green
state and eat it with the seed and pod.
Its keen tart gives a good relish for
food. You can usually purchase 4 or
500 pods of Tamarinds for 7½ cents,
the pulp and seeds being taken out of
the pods and neatly packed in pack-
ages of 100 or more each. But this
year it is so scarce that you can scarcely
get 100 pods for that price.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Tamarind wood is durable, hard
and beautifully veined. The natives use
the tender leaves in their curries, as
they do also the pulp. The seeds re-
duced to a fine powder and boiled forms
a tenacious paste, and a strong wood
cement, if a little glue be added.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Fruits of all kinds that should be
ripe in April and May when most
needed of all seasons of the year, are
very scarce this year. It was pre-
dicted early in February, when we
had an uncommonly copious rain,
that that would surely produce a
great crop of mangoes and other
spring fruit; but it proves to have
been a false prophecy. And the prin-
ciple cause of the failure we conceive
to have been the drought in 1864
which cut off the rice crop. The im-
pression made then on all these fruit
bearing trees was too deep to be ef-
faced by ever so favorable rains in so
short a space of time.{{< /news/text >}}

Correspondence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}To the Editor of the "Bangkok Recorder."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}SIR,-—I have been thinking for some
time that I would try to write you a
kind of a letter of condolence, but the
truth of the matter is, I am a "shock-
ing" bad writer, and the weather has
really been so hot, that I could not
get myself worked up to the writing
point, or in other words I could not
get the efflatus up. Some folks may
say I have not got it up yet, but then
we can't mind what every body says.
I suppose there never would have been
a great man in the world, if he had
kept taking into account what every
one had to say about him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But speaking of the weather-—it is
very difficult to write these days, with
the thermometer at 96º in the shade,
and also having enjoyed the luxury of
a night sweat during the previous
night. In the early morning it is ge-
nerally quite pleasant, but the sun
soon rises, and like the rest of us, is
apparently not the least bit refreshed
by his night's repose, and keeps roast-
ing away at us from the time he rises
until he sets. A slight shower of
rain the other morning accompanied
with some thunder, had a salutary ef-
fect upon the atmosphere for a time,
but it soon passed off again. Flitting
clouds however, and the watery ap-
pearance of the sky indicate that ere
long we will be refreshed by copious
showers. Almost every body says
that this is the warmest weather they
have ever experienced in Siam, and
what every body says must of course
be true. There is a tendency in hu-
man nature, however, to apply the su-
perlative degree to the last scene
through which they have passed, what-
ever that scene may have been. Did
you ever see a ship Captain who did
not consider the last gale or storm
through which he had passed the
most severe one he had ever been in?
Whether the thermometer has really
stood higher than it did through the
hot season last year, or not I can't say,
but I can say that I have never expe-
rienced anything which so much af-
fected me as the last few weeks. The
fault however may not be in the wea-
ther but in me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But I am going astray from the sub-
ject with which I started out; and you
must take this as a kind of prologue
to that which is to come. It may be
imprudent in me to do so, but I deem
it my duty to inform you, that for
some time you have not been so firm-
ly fixed upon the throne of the
"Fourth Estate" as you might rea-
sonably suppose. A rather formidable
conspiracy has been in progress against
you, and although the principle dan-
ger is now past, or at least so far as I
can see it is past, I still deem it my
duty to congratulate you upon what
you have escaped, and condole you
upon any trouble that may yet be in
store for you. You have unfortuna-
tely brought down upon you some of
the "powers that be" and also some
of those that "would be." It is even
whispered that some of those from
whom you might expect better things,
secretly wish for your demise. But
it is also whispered that those powers
to which you are most immediately
amenable, are all right, and if that be
so, you need not fear, though a host
encamp against you. The fact is your
kingdom diffuses too much light for
some of your neighbors; and there are
fears that some dark regions might be
illuminated, and some revelations
made. If I were a monarch, there is
no other realm in which I would ra-
ther reign than in yours, but at the
same time I suppose there is no other,
in which the duties of the sovereign
are more arduous. Especially is that
the case in a place like this where the
loyal subjects are few, and each one
has his own peculiar views and tastes.
Every one too is a critic, and can talk
learnedly upon the subjects of law
science, theology and of business, in
short all those subjects, with which
you have to deal. Should the Edi-
tor attempt to instruct them upon
these subjects, of course he is ridicul-
ed as being incompetent. I don't of
course pretend to say that you do al-
ways exactly right, or that you are not
sometimes justly criticised, or that
your selections, and editorials are al-
ways the very best, under the circum-
stances. You, like the rest of man-
kind, have your failings, but you
mean to do right. Your intentions
are good. Men as a general thing
like to see themselves in print, but
they are sometimes particular about
the connections. You should be ex-
ceedingly careful not to mention any
of their faults, or short comings, but
always put in a little praise or flattery,
whether they deserve it or not. It
don't cost much, and a little goes a
great ways. Make it general too, don't
heap it all on a few. With a little
care you may weather the present
storm, and afterwards manage to steer
clear.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You will ever find me ready to con-
dole with you upon any appearance of
grief, and in the mean time I remain
as usual.{{< /news/text >}}

Yours Sincerely,
SCRIBBLER.

MARRIED.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 26th inst. at the residence of
Captain John Bush Harbor master and
M. Attendant-—by Rev: Wm. Dean
D. D.—-Mr. James Clifton Campbell
of New York, Inspector of customs
in this city, to Miss Mary Greig of
Edinburgh.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There were about 44 resident Eu-
ropeans and American to witness the
ceremony, after which the whole party
partook of a sumptuous dinner with
appropriate toasts, given by the Am-
erican Consul, the English Consul, the
Harbor Master and others.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Excellency Chow Phya Kala-
home the Prime Minister kindly gran-
ted the party the use of his brass Band,
who played several airs during the
dinner. After dinner dancing com-
menced and continued until after
midnight.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The premises were very elaborate-
ly decorated with flags, flowers, and
evergreens, and had a most imposing
appearance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Every one appeared happy and well
satisfied both with the ceremony and
the feast. Dr. Dean was highly com-
plimented for the satisfactory manner
in which he had performed the marri-
age service.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}H. S. M. Gun-boat “Impregnable”
left on the morning of the 25th bound

went as passenger. It is we believe
intended that the “Impregnable”
shall take the place of the “Chow
Phya” in conveying mails between
this and Singapore until the latter
shall have undergone thorough repairs
in Dock at Singapore.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Our American friends T. Miller and

{{< news/text >}}J. Hood Esq. Am. Consul, we un-
derstand, has changed his residence
from the Chandler mansion to the brick
house of Messrs Pickenpack Thies &
Co. a location more central than the
former.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Saturday evening the 21st inst.
while the daily shipping reports of
Messrs Dyer, Schmidt & Co. were be-
ing printed, one of the men who came
with the boat, being left in charge of
it at our landing, while the other was
getting the reports, stole the boat, and
as far as we know, has not since been
heard of. The other man remained
in our compound till about 6 A. M. on
Sabbath morning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}As the weather is always a never
failing topic of remark in all our dai-
ly meetings, so it may not be thought
altogether out of taste and place for
this issue of the *Bangkok Recorder*
to speak the 3rd or 4th time on this
fruitful theme. As all our previous
remarks were made before the
type came to a fixture on the bed of
the press, we may on the eve of this day
report that the residents of Bangkok
enjoyed the great luxury of a thun-
der shower this morning. The rain
though scanty was enough to cheer all
our hearts and enliven greatly all the
families of the vegetable kingdom in
the metropolis. The electrical influ-
ences and the rain combined have
brought the temperature down 10 de-
grees, at least, and have even extended
so high as to cheer the king of day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As the water of our noble river, in
consequence of the long absence of
rain, has become quite brackish, and
as our stores of rain water and fresh
river water taken in November and
kept for drinking purposes had become
nearly exhausted, we hoped to have
replenished our stores to day. But it
requires a copious rain to wash off
suitably the filth from our tiled and
thatched roofs that has been accumul-
ating on them during the course of two
months of drought, and the rain this
morning was not sufficient for that.
Hence we are living in hope that our
Heavenly Father will send us another
shower soon, of which there is every
probability we shall have an abund-
ance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are glad to inform our distant
readers that it is indeed true as sur-
mised by us in our last issue, that Mes-
srs J. Thomson and H. G. Kennedy
have returned from the famous city
Ongcor in Cambodia. They arrived
on the 17th inst, coming from Cam-
poot up the gulf in a small country
boat. They were absent on their tour
of observation nearly three months,
spending about three weeks at the mar-
vellous temple in ruins and its vi-
cinity. They seem to think that
"the half had not been told them" of
what they saw, and that they them-
selves, even, have only entered the
vestibule of future discoveries. In-
deed so far as our poor *Recorder* is
concerned, their ideas are as yet quite
inexpressible. But we hope by much
importunity to induce one or both of
those scientific travelers to take up
their pens to give us at least a smatter-
ing of what they have seen and learn-
ed in that second Ninevah.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We learn that the "Hard Case"
spoken of in our issue of the 13th
inst. promises to result in good not
only to the noble Siamese sailor who
so valiantly fought the pirates and
helped to save the "Conqueror," but
also to the cause of Siamese sailors
generally. It will be remembered
that that Siamese *Tar* was not only
turned adrift without any substantial
applause from the owner of the ship or
any one else, but also with scarcely
money enough to pay the Surgeon's
small bill for his care of the wounds he
received in resisting the pirates. We
published substantially that state-
ment of the hard case in our Siamese
"Recorder" a few days later, and that
together with a few plain and practi-
cal remarks we appended seems to
have hit the mark at which it was
aimed, and roused a determination on
the part of Chawsôoa ———— to deal
well by that sailor. It may be that he
had the good intention before, as he inti-
mated to us in conversation a week
since, but, if all be true that has been
reported of that sailor, Mr.—was cer-
tainly culpable in keeping it locked
up in his own bosom so long.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It seems to us that the commanding
officers of Siamese merchantmen
should take special pains to honor such
of their men as the one above refer-
red to, as naval commanders do their
remarkably gallant men. In doing
so they would do much to awaken a
noble enthusiasm in Siamese to per-
form like deeds of valor in like circum-
stances. This spirit is but in its in-
fancy as regards the Siamese in every
department. But as it has been born,
and is really breathing among them,
it may and must be well nourished as
it has been in Europe where it was
once as puny and infantile as here.
Let all Siamese owners of ships and
their commanders take up this infant
destined for great good and glory in
Siam and feed it with the best milk
of their approbation. Let the Sia-
mese government lend her powerful
hand. Let all the monied men and
others of influence contribute to its
growth and well being. And then,
not many years hence, Siam will not
be wanting for gallant men in any
department, whether of literature, ag-
riculture, commerce, the army, the
navy, the church or the state.{{< /news/text >}}

Good Wives.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}THERE is nothing men like to write
about better than good wives. This
is reasonable enough, for there is noth-
ing, certainly, in which mankind are
more interested. "A good wife," says
one, "is to a man wisdom and courage,
and hope, and endurance, "The pow-
er of a wife," says another, "for good
or evil", is almost irresistible." "No
spirit," it is said again, "can long re-
sist bad domestic influences;" and yet
again, "No condition is hopeless when
the wife possesses firmness, decision,
energy, and economy." "A bad wife,"
remarks one of the authors already
quoted, "is confusion, weakness, dis-
comfiture, despair," ",bad enough, is it
not, good woman! Then of home,
the same son says: "If at home, a man
finds no rest, and is there met with a
bad temper, sullenness, or gloom, or
is assailed by discontent, complaint,
and reproaches, the heart breaks, the
spirit is crushed, hope vanishes, and
the man sinks into total despair."
There is, however, another side of
this picture. Influence is not all on
one side. Man has some influence.
Women may be happy or miserable
as they have good or bad husbands;
in fact, they may become good or bad
as they are influenced by those to
whom they are indissolubly bound.
And we believe husbands have a little
to do with making homes happy as
well as wives. If when the wife has
done her best to make home happy,
her efforts are met by reproaches, and
temper, sullenness, gloom, discontent,
and complaint, by a husband who
thinks the whole sphere of a wife's
duty lies in listening to his fault-find-
ing, ,bearing his ill-nature, and return-
ing caresses and smiles for his irrita-
tions and peevishness; in short, mak-
ing it her chief end to bear and soothe
his reasonable and unreasonable com-
plaints, it is not strange she, too,
should sink into despair.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Neither husbands nor wives have
any just claim on their other halves to
supply all the stock of goodness for
the uses of the family. If a married
man desires a better wife, let him
teach her to be good. Let him prac-
tise the art of goodness himself, and
exercise towards her all of those ami-
able qualities he would so delight in
being the object of. Almost invaria-
bly it would be happiness lent, to re-
turn eventually with a liberal interest.

English Feeling about
Jamaica.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}An able Englishman writes of the
shudder that the Jamaican massacres
threw over England as follows. The
rap which the last paragraph gives the
author of the Sartor Resartus is ra-
ther severe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I am glad to say that the last in-
telligence from Jamaica has created a
most painful impression throughout
England, and the attacks in the Gov-
ernor's speech against the Baptist mis-
sionaries have excited the indignation
of the "religious" world to an unpre-
cedented degree. My own impression
is that, quite apart from any other
considerations, the political pressure
which the Dissenting communities can
bring to bear upon all borough mem-
bers of Parliament will ensure deci-
sive action on the part of the Govern-
ment. Governor Eyre will probably be
recalled, and a commission of enquiry
sent out to Jamaica. Such reparation,
God knows, is alight enough. I wish
I felt sure it would be granted. In
spite of the experience of the last
five years, I never realized till now
how strongly our educated classes
were imbued with a sort of sneaking
pro-slavery sympathy. Mr. Carlyle
has much to answer for; his influence
as a teacher, I am thankful to say, is
dying out; he has outlived his literary
reputation; and the public has grown
weary of his tricks of writing, his
constant repetitions and his stilted style.
But the influence of his servile wor-
ship of brute force, his brutal con-
tempt for the weak, and his prepos-
terous deification of the one duty of
work, has survived his fame. His
twaddle about Black Quashee, the
"eternal veracities," and the rest of
the dreary jargon in which slavery
was really held up to honor and aboli-
tionism to contempt, have left an evil
leaven in the minds of the present
generation of our governing classes;
Possibly I write too strongly, but then
I feel strongly on this matter. If you
could see, as I have seen for years,
how deep the sophistries to which
Carlyle gave utterance have worked
their way into the minds of educated
Englishmen, you would, I think, share
my feelings. In my judgment, the
author of the "Latter-Day Pamph-
lets" has done as much to pervert the
moral sense of his countrymen as he
has to degrade their language. More
than that I cannot say."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}HEALTH AND WEALTH.-—There is a
difference between these two temporal
blessings—-health and money. Money
is the most envied, but the least en-

of the latter is more obvious, when we
reflect that the poorest man would not
part with health for money, but that
the richest would gladly part with all
his money for health.{{< /news/text >}}

General Schurz's Report.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This report on the condition of
things in the Southern States is much
the most important that has come to
us. We are almost ready to say, it
is worth the rest combined. The
choice of such a man as Carl Schurz
for the duty he has done implied an
earnestness of purpose and a deter-
mination to obtain the whole and the ex-
act truth, which reassured the friends
of liberty and terrified its foes. For
this man had eyes to see, mind to com-
prehend, heart to feel, and tongue to
speak. He accepted the trust under
a profound sence of responsibility; he
went; he devoted three months to the
task of observation in the states of
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, and the Department of the
Gulf. He had every facility, and he
used every opportunity, neglecting no
means of information, and drawing
swift but sure inferences as he went
along. Here we have his report. It
covers nearly three broad pages of the
Tribune with fine print, exclusive of
the great mass of documentary testi-
mony in every form by which his sep-
arate statements are made good. To
that documentary testimony he appeals
for proof that he has studiously avoided
overstatements, and has uttered no lan-
guage stronger than was warranted by
his convictions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A calmer, quieter, more reasonable
more careful, but at the same time,
more terrible, paper was never written.
It describes a state of affairs in every
aspect appalling. It has many subdi-
visions; it treats of many subjects; it
touches on every phase of life and
thought; it searches keenly the whole
Southern mind; it lays bare the very
nerves of the social system; but from
no quarter does it bring any but sad tid-
ings, and in no direction does it point
to any certain deliverance. The situ-
ation of the Union men throughout the
country he visited affected him sadly.
The further his observations extended,
the clearer it became to him that their
existence in the South was of a preca-
rious nature. Gov. Sharkey even ad-
mitted that, if our troops were drawn
from Mississippi, the lives of Northern
men would not be safe. And Gen. Os-
terhaus assured him that, in the event
of withdrawing the troops, the state of
affairs would be intolerable for all Un-
ion men and all recent emigrants from
the North.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If this be the state of feeling in re-
gard to the white loyalists, what must
it be toward the black? On every
ground, and in every particular, as de-
plorable as can be imagined. As
black people, as people who stood by
the government, as people who have
been slaves and are now free, as people
who were always despised, and who now,
in addition to being despised, are both
hated and feared, they are subjected to
every species of annoyance and perse-
cution. The mere specification of
their various indignities would occupy
more space than our whole article must
fill. Their ignorance and docility are
practiced on in every conceivable way.
They are cheated, over-reached, pillag-
ed, turned adrift, insulted, beaten, tied
up by the thumbs, maimed, and mur-
dered, without stint. Every device
that cunning can hit on is resorted to
for the purpose of reducing them
again to the condition of slavery.
Both the former slaveholders and the
non-slaveholders "are possessed by a
singularly bitter and vindictive feel-
ing against the colored race." In
Alabama, which Gen. Howard's re-
port passes over so smoothly, "the
efforts made to hold the negro in a
state of subjection appear to have
been of a particularly atrocious nat-
ure." In portions of the northern
part of Mississippi, "the colored people
are kept in slavery still." "Reports
from sub-commissioners nearest that
locality show that the blacks are in a
much worse state than before." In
South-western Georgia, "organized
patrols, with negro hounds, keep guard
over the thoroughfares, and the un-
fortunate who attempts to escape, or
he who returns for his wife or child,
is waylaid or pursued by hounds, and
shot or hung." Nor is this the worst.
General Schurz tells us that the white
people cannot and will not do justice
to the blacks. Those who accept the
fact of his emancipation do not ad-
mit the law of his liberty. They have
no faith in his capacity for any but
menial work in the cities, and plan-
tation work out of them. They have
no faith that he will work at all except
under compulsion. They have no
faith that he can take care of himself
without patronage. They have no
faith in the experiment of free black
labor, though some are willing to try
it. With very few exceptions, they
are opposed vehemently to all efforts
toward his mental, moral, and social
elevation.{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a word they refuse all light on
the negro's character and condition,
assuming that they alone know any-
thing about him, and insisting on
making the degradation they have
brought him to the standard of his
capacity. He must bear the blame
for everything that goes wrong. He
must be held answerable that nothing
goes right. "I heard a Georgian
planter argue most seriously that one
of his negroes had shown himself cer-
tainly unfit for freedom, because he
impudently refused to submit to a
whipping."{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is almost superfluous to say that
in the South itself Gen. Schurs finds
no remedy for its social decrepitude.
While cheerfully admitting that there
are many intelligent, liberal, and
right-minded men among the former
slaveholders, their number is insig-
nificant in the population, and their
influence hardly appreciable on the
mass of public opinion. Both leaders
and people submit from sheer neces-
sity, and openly say so. Save in ex-
ceptional instances, there is an entire
absence of national feeling; there ap-
pears to be no disposition to accept
the results of the war in a loyal spirit,
no wish or purpose to adjust any
department of society to a new order
of things. The states have made or-
dinances abolishing slavery, but
they will not be looked on as barring
the establishment of a new form of
servitude." Bloody collisions, rest-
less fluctuations, and anarchical con-
fusion may be expected to follow from
the course generally adopted toward
the negroes. There is no help if the
General Government does not give
it. The only safety is in its presence
with law and force. To withdraw the
troops, Gen. Schurz declares, would
be exceedingly perilous to loyal people
of every condition and color. The
negro must be secured in his personal
and civil rights; he must be educated;
he must have the freedom of the
courts; he must have the suffrage.
On this last point the General is par-
ticularly strenuous. He considers
the suffrage of vital importance to all
concerned; but he has no expectation
whatever that the Southern people
will ever, on their own motion, be in-
duced to grant it. The masses are
strongly opposed to it. The per-
secuted Unionists were the only people
that were found to favor it. Outside
of Louisiana, but one Southern gen-
tleman of social and political standing
was met who approved of it. The
only way of securing that crowning
achievement is, in Carl Schurz's judg-
ment, to impose it as a condition pre-
cedent to "re-admission."—-N. Y. In-
dependent Jan. 4.{{< /news/text >}}

Old Type in New Uses.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The energetic and irrepressible Mrs
Swisshelm has started her new paper
at Washington, The Reconstruction-
ist.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It it printed in the type formerly
used by the Washington Weekly
News, and the editor says of it:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Taking it in preference to a new
office, all mixed and pied, and filled
with sand and cobwebs, as it was, has
cost us some delay, and made the
appearance of our paper less attractive
than new type would have done; but
our attention once turned to it, we
could not resist the desire to make
this old type talk for freedom once at
least before it was consigned to the
furnace and purified by fire. Here, at
the capital of this boasted free country,
where it had advertised the coffee and
the slave pen, where it had reported
spread-eagle Fourth-of-July speeches
side by side with calls for ‘likely young
negroes,’ it must proclaim the year of
jubilee. These old cuts of runaway
slaves, must not melt in the fervent
heat of the indignation of God and
man until they have advertised another
class of runaways.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“There is poetic justice in making
this old type tell the world that God
is faithful and true, that He heard the
prayers of His saints, wrung out by
it in agony when the loved, and soon
to be lost, were thereby offered for the
southern market. The cries of the
oppressed did enter into the ears of
the Lord of Sabbaoth; and the year
of His redeemed is come. Thank God,
old type! thank God that the slave is
free, and will soon vote, here in
Washington, and in every state of
this Union, without bowing to his
former master and saying, “by your
leave, sir!” —-Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}
