{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A place for the Bible.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
BY REV. R. P. WILLARD.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}In ancient times it was customary for
a prophet, after writing a prophecy, to
nail up the parchment on the temple-
gate, that all the people might read it.
De Quincy, we think, asserts that a thing
is not necessarily published because it is
printed. Next to having a good book
circulated, it should be read. Once, in
Scotland, a persecution drove the people
to putting their Bible into corners. One
family concealed it under a great foot-
stool. It was a safe place, ever within
reach, and was read. We fear that
Christians now hide the Bible in corners
where it is read with difficulty. We fear
too many families keep the Word of God
quite out of reach, and further off than
the Scotchman's footstool.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is, first, the HALF-CORNER. This
is a nook on the most inconvenient shelf
in the old bookcase. If you examine the
spot carefully, you must dig down through
various strata of papers, magazines, Sun-
day school and hymn-books; then through
a heavier ledge of such solid reading as
Doddridge and Baxter have left us, ere
you come to the good Book below them
all, in the lowest stratum. In doing all
this, you must be sure not to disarrange
the shelf. The books must be left in the
same conical pile which has stood for fif-
ty years; and when you are through
reading, the Bible must be put back in
its old place in the corner, and the door
closed, as if it wasn't opened except on
Sundays. This is the rule of the house,
and nobody introduces himself to this
shelf-corner without regarding the house-
wife's orderly ways and conical bookpile.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is also the STAND-CORNER. This
is not quite so inconvenient. If a des-
perate sortie be made, a copy of the
Scriptures can be recovered without any-
thing more serious than overhauling a
dozen papers, spilling trinkets from the
work-basket, jogging the lamp, and over-
turning the apples from the glass vase.
Often a history of the Rebellion and the
child[?]n's Christmas primers will have to
be encountered. Whatever goes wrong,
one must not suppose for an instant that
the head of the family, who has burrowed
for so many years into this corner, ever
has any trouble; nor that the children
can ever be afraid of a book which is
seldom brought out except by upheavals
of everybody's things.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We might allude also to the TRUNK-
CORNER. While this is a safe place, the
objection is that trunks are now so deep
that, when a young man keeps his Bible
in this corner, it rarely sees the daylight.
It is so much easier, even on the Sab-
bath, to reach a copy of Dickens or
Shakespeare on the table than to stoop
so far for a spiritual book.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From all this we may safely affirm that
in most families the Word of God is too
much "laid on the shelf" and put into
corners. It is just as bad where the book,
soft with velvet, has such heavy golden
clasps that it is difficult to open. We
remember the Bible has been many times
locked to many; and, therefore,
this superstition of gold clasps
is half a lock to many; and is, there-
fore, unopened, or, like a money-box,
put away in a dark corner.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If pains were taken to keep the Word
of God WITHIN REACH, our families
would read it far more. Many a soldier
during the war learned a new way of
reading the Bible, because he could al-
ways reach it, for he carried a copy
against his heart! Abolish, then, the old
corners. Start a fashion of leaving the
Bible on the table, where anybody can
take it up without attracting curiosity or
undermining the house. Have it printed
and bound for use. In type and ar-
rangement give it as lovely a face as any
book in the library. Not the great
quarto which would crush little Mary, of
six years, if she attempts to carry it to
her father before prayers; nor the tuode-
cimo, with type to blind the eyes and
make every page look alike. We prefer
a Bible with such a look inside that every
verse seems to say, "What do I mean?"
and every page at once, as you open
it, "Do I look like Paul's words, or
Christ's?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such a Bible, if not "laid away," will
be read. Such a book, with text-marks
and the owner's marginal notes, will at-
tract the eye at once. Just give it table-
room to get open; and it will have notice.
It will become the family book. And we
need only add that, when by-and-by the
minister is called in after some one dies
—a Christian, as they tell us—it will not
be necessary for him to make special in-
quiry for a Bible in the house, as is often
the case, that he may find the most ap-
propriate words for the introductory ser-
vice of the funeral.—INDEPENDENT.{{< /news/text >}}

Samuel Fiske.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following reminiscences of Rev.
Samuel Fiske, popularly known as "Dunn
Browne," are from an article in the last
CONGREGATIONAL QUARTERLY.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Professor Tyler says of him:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Entering Amherst College, in the
autumn of 1844, as, I believe, the young-
est, and, as I know, the smallest, and, as
his classmates will all agree, the brightest
and smartest of his class, he took at once
high rank as a scholar. Perhaps his
forte was in mathematics; but he excel-
led also in the classics; and all the depart-
ments. {{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}I remember just where he sat, and
just how he looked, when he was a Junior
under my own instruction. In my mind's
eye I see him now, curled up in the corner
of his seat, scarcely occupying more room
than a kitten, playful as a kitten, too, still
the boy, and yet in promise the coming
man of his class, his eye flashing with in-
terest, his face beaming with intellectual
life and joy, and his whole body vibrat-
ing and throbbing in spontaneous sym-
pathy with his active mind."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Many of his sallies are remembered, as
well as his drawing food for mirth even
from the Hebrew grammar. One re-
collection must suffice. At an examina-
tion of the class, by the professor in
theology, being questioned upon some
topic, he omitted one point, to which the
professor called his attention. He re-
membered, he said, that was treated, but
had forgotten how. "Well, sir," said
the professor, in his peculiar and genial
way, "suppose you were on a western
steamboat, and somebody should ask you
about that point, how would it do for you
to answer, that Professor — said
something about it, but you did not real-
ly know that?" "Ah," replied he,
"nobody will catch me on a western
steamboat without notes of Professor
—'s lectures under my arm!" The
imaginary scene was altogether too much
for the gravity of the professor and the
class.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In 1852, he returned to Amherst, where
he spent the next three years as tutor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Still a mere freshman, in apparent
age and size, and mistaken for such when
he first came upon the college grounds,
some of the fathers of the freshman-class
were disposed to patronise the young man,
and more fatherly sophomores undertook
to give him good advice touching his
duties to his superiors. He enjoyed the
mistake too well to correct it; and his
amusement was only equalled by their
surprise when they discovered their error
by finding him in the tutor's chair, and
themselves sitting under his instruction. A-
bout the same time a clergyman, laboring
under the same mistake, asked him if he
proposed to enter college. He replied
that he had about made up his mind to
take a shorter course into the ministry.
The clergyman proceeded to argue the
point, insisting on the superior value of
a college education, when the tutor en-
lightened him by saying, 'Perhaps you do
not understand my reasons for not enter-
ing college: it is because I have already
been through, and know all about it by
experience.'"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the call came for three hundred
thousand men, he entered the army as a
private soldier, but was soon promoted
to the rank of captain, and fell at the
head of his command, on the second day
of the battle of the Wilderness, and died
after sixteen days of suffering. His last
hours are thus described:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"When a surgical examination had re-
moved the last ground of hope for his
recovery, and a chill came over him,
which he took for the last, he said, 'Now,
death can't be far off;' but presently he
added, 'heaven is a better country than
this.' Then, turning to his brother, he
inquired, 'Ass, do you think heaven
comes right off, that is, immediately after
death? Well; I shall be there and know
all about it pretty soon.' Then followed
messages of love to absent friends, tender
words to those by his side, particular
charges touching his 'darling' children,
and thoughtful instructions about his
affairs—-all as calm and tranquil as if he
were in perfect health. The last night
of his life, as his brother was sitting by
his side, at midnight, he seemed to be
awake and thinking. Presently, he said,
"I have been running everything over in
my mind, to see if I had left anything
undone towards them;' meaning his wife
and children. 'I can't think of anything
I have left.' When assured that he had
remembered everything, and had nothing
to do but just to lay himself in Jesus'
arms, and rest, he smiled as if well pleas-
ed; and when asked, 'You can love
and trust Him?' he said, 'Yes, I can,
perfectly.' They repeated hymns to
him, such as 'Jesus, lover of my soul,' 
and 'Rock of ages, cleft for me;' and he
repeated them after them. His brother
happening to pass between him and the
light, he asked, 'Who is that?' 'Your
brother Asa; you must not forget him.'
Instantly carrying the significance of the
words forward to that world whither he
was so soon going, he said, 'heaven must
be a very forgetful place if I do.' Sab-
bath morning, the salutation, 'To-day I
shall get my marching orders; well, I am
ready.' His brother asked him how he
had rested. 'Oh, beautifully!' he an-
swered, 'just like a sleeping angel.' Then
he smiled, and added, 'But I don't look
much like one, do I?' Thus cheerfully
did he obey his last orders—-thus natural-
ly did he die, just as he lived—-just like
himself; thus beautifully did he pass
from the Sabbath on earth to the Sab-
bath in heaven. And now he has fought
his last fight, and conquered the last
enemy."—PACIFIC.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}President Johnson has signed the bill
re-admitting Tennessee, but sent a mes-
sage to Congress stating that his signa-
ture was not to be considered as admit-
ting the right of Congress to pass laws
preliminary to the admission of States,
nor as committing himself to the state-
ments made in the preamble. The Ra-

message with derisive laughter.{{< /news/text >}}

speedy trial.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From a later despatch, dated July 29,
we quote the following items:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The passage of the bill revising the
neutrality laws by the House of Repre-
sentatives has created much excitement
in Fenian circles, and it is believed that
the measure was carried in consequence
of the sympathy felt by the Radicals for
the Fenians. The bill, though general in
its applications, is regarded as having a
particular bearing upon the Fenian move-
ment. Previous to its passage prominent
Fenians had been in frequent consulta-
tion with several of the leading Radical
members, and have been on the floor of
the House watching the debate upon the
bill. Colonel Roberts, the Head Con-
gressmen, including Banks, of Mas-
sachusetts. Journals sympathising with
the Fenians interpret the new law so as
to permit the sale of war vessels and
material to the Fenians, and predict the
resuscitation of the Brotherhood and the
speedy development of hostile purposes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Senate passed—-24 to 19-—the bill
admitting Nebraska into the Union as a
State. Mr. Sumner, of Massachusetts,
opposed the bill on the ground that the
constitution of Nebraska limited the right
of suffrage to white men.{{< /news/text >}}

The Anti-Slavery Society.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The thirty-third anniversary of the
American Anti-Slavery Society was held
on Tuesday, May 8th, in the Church of the
Puritans. The chair was taken at 10 o'clock
by Mr. Wendell Phillips, President of the
Society. Theodore Tilton, Lucretia Mott,
Susan B. Anthony and Mrs. Stanton oc-
cupied seats on the platform.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The proceedings were opened with pray-
er by the Rev. George H. Hepworth, of
Boston. Letters from Hon. Charles Sum-
ner and Chief-Justice Chase, and others,
were read.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Phillips read the following resolu-
tions, having previously stated that they
would form the subject of discussion at
the meeting:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That considering what the
nation owes the negro, what it has pro-
mised him, and remembering the lesson of
the war, it is evident there is no course for
us to tread, either safe, just, or honorable,
except to guarantee to him at once every
political right enjoyed by every citizen, in
the same circumstances. Every other
path is alike deathly and infamous.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That the present condition of
the negro is one of nominal freedom, but
of suffering almost equal with that he en-
dured under the yoke, of entire dependence
on the white race for every privilege, and
the recognition of every right—that no
mere enactment of Congress can alter this,
unless it makes him in every respect the
absolute equal of the white man before
the law.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That the Southern States may
see the history and future of policy they
are initiating in the glass of Jamaica, and
find that every attempt to cheat the eman-
cipated negro out of substantial freedom
incurs bankruptcy, wrecks property, and
ends in blood.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That the Rebellion has not
ceased; it has only changed its weapons.
Once it fought, now it intrigues; once it
followed Lee in arms, now it follows
President Johnson in guile and chicanery;
once it had its headquarters in Richmond,
now it encamps in the White House.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That the President has be-
trayed the loyal North: is bent on giving
it over, bound hand foot, into the hands
of its once conquered foe; that he should
long ago have been impeached for gross
usurpation in his manifest use of his
high powers to aid Rebellion, and for the
treasonable purpose of defeating the secure
and peaceful settlement of the nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That the cordial thanks of the
nation, especially of the Abolitionists, are
due to the clear-sighted and devoted cour-
age of Congress for its check and rebuke
to treason by passing the Civil Rights bill
over the veto of the Southern leader.
[Applause.]{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved That we demand of Congress,
as clearly within its constitutional author-
ity, to secure, by appropriate legislation,
his political rights, especially the right of
suffrage, to every citizen of the United
States (applause); to assert as a principle
of national law definitely settled by the
defeat of the Rebellion in the field, that no
State is REPUBLICAN in a constitutional
and national sense which makes any dis-
tinction in civil or political rights among
its citizens on account of race or descent;
and thirdly to call on the loyal citizens of
the late rebellious States to assemble, by
delegates in Convention in such State, and
form for it a State Constitution and State
measures to regain its place in Congress
by choice of senators and representatives:
but that the basis of final settlement should
be universal suffrage and universal amnes-
ty. (Applause.){{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That once a compromise of
great principles for immediate ends might
have had some plausible defense; but,
to-day, and in this crisis, whoever pur-
poses to settle any national issue on any
basis but that of absolute justice mistakes
his time—has failed to learn the lesson of
the War—postpones justice, weakens liberty,
jeopards nationality, and is a worse traitor,
because a more dangerous one, than any
armed Rebel has been for the last four
years. Better defeat on a true basis than
success on a compromise of rights. (Ap-
plause.) Better that the Rebels should take
possession of the Government in 1868 than
thwart the course of events and surrender
the fruits of victory by agreeing to any
compromise which accepts peace on terms
unjust to any race, interest, or section.
[Applause.]{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved, That when Representatives
and Senators forgot the last four years, and
imitated the truckling politicians of our
disgraceful eras, by admitting the white
aristocracy of Colorado as a Republican
State into this Union—they stultified
themselves, betrayed the North, and every
the Traitor of the White House and the
Rebels of the South an unanswerable ar-
gument against all their hollow zeal for
justice and freedom. [Great applause.]

Great Events.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}By our last European mails—-the
one by the “Seewoon” the other by
the “Chow Phya” we have it fully
confirmed that two great events have
recently occurred in the Western
world well worthy of signalizing any
year, even this which has long been
anticipated and accounted by Biblical
scholars as the greatest, in some res-
pects, of all the years that have come
and gone since the commencement of
the christian era. We allude to the
successful working of the Atlantic
Telegraph line, and the new division
of political power in Europe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The successful working of the At-
lantic Telegraph, we are persuaded, is
an event which has wrapped up in it
oceans of future good and glory to
our world, and will be opened for her
use with great rapidity by Him who
is the Wisdom the Counsellor the
Mighty God over all. Already has it
narrowed the Atlantic ocean to a small
river so that persons can converse to-
gether from shore to shore. Already
Europe and America are saluting each
other daily by the hearty good morning;
and are hourly talking together on the
great topics of Church and State.
The great transactions of the two con-
tinents are now being hourly brought
with lightning rapidity to each others
doors, and the business men on either
continent have only to step to their
doors at any time to hear of all the
great and leading events that are
transpiring on either hemisphere. And
this magnificent work is going to give
birth to a multitude of other Atlantic
Telegraphs in rapid succession, until
messages between the Eastern and
Western worlds will be carried by
lightning in continual floods.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And with regard to the new divi-
sion of power in Europe, it appears to
us that sublime strides have been
made towards popular rule and per-
fection in human government—That
absolutism in Europe has received its
death warrant—-That Popery is now
entirely girdled and must soon die—
That Rome is shut up in liberated
Italy and cannot long hold out against
the tide of Italian progress by which
she is becoming more and more cir-
cumscribed in her civil and religious
despotism—-That France ceases to be
a dictator to the European nations—-
That Austria, having been thoroughly
humbled can no longer cramp Italy
nor have a word to say in the rule of
any of the German States—-That Prus-
sia, while in the pride of her heart,
she thought to enlarge her borders and
establish an absolute monarchy has
been made by the “King of kings”
to work wondrous good by consolida-
ting Germany and constituting her
essentially a limited monarchy in
which she herself can have only her
due proportion of power, but united
with her sister states will become the
bulwark of Europe, contrasted with
which even France cannot hope to be
first.-—That in France the principles
of popular government have received
a great impetus by the steps which
Napoleon III took to enlarge his em-
pire and establish his absolutism-—And
that finally England, comparatively
free from absolutism as she has long
been, feels stimulated by what she has
witnessed in the U. S. and by what
she is seeing on the continent of Eu-
rope to renewed courage and effort in
seeking still more advancement in the
principles of liberty and popular gov-
ernment, and will never be quiet until
aristocracy has been thoroughly era-
dicated.{{< /news/text >}}

The Sandwich Islands.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having recently received a very in-
teresting book titled The Hawaiian
Islands by Rev. R. Anderson D. D.
senior secretary of the A. B. C. F. M.
we propose to write a series of articles
for the Recorder based on the inform-
ation this book gives concerning those
Islands. Our main object is to show
what the gospel has done for that
once most benighted, degraded, and
barbarous people, and what it is wait-
ing to do for the Siamese whom we
may regard as standing on the thresh-
hold of civilisation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Hawaiian Islands have general-
ly been denominated The Sandwich
Islands, a name given to them by
Capt Ja. Cook who was the first Eu-
ropean to discover them in 1778. But
this name is not recognized in the
constitution and laws of the Islands.
They are known by the people and
the Laws only as The Hawaiian Is-
lands, the largest isle of the group giv-
ing name to the ten. Their respective
names are Hawaii, Maui, Mo-lo-kini,
Ka-hu-la-we, La-nai, Mo-lo-kai, Kau-
ai, Ni-i-hau, and Kau-la. They are
situated about midway in the Pacific
Ocean between Panama and Canton,
and very nearly in a strait line from
the two places—-their direction from
Panama being about West one point
North. The group are nearly all in a
line stretching N. E. & S. E.—-Ha-
waii being the most southerly. They
lie between 18°50' and 22°20' North
latitude; and 154°53' and 160°15'
west longitude from Greenwich. Their
distance from Canton is 4800, from
Japan 3400, and from Sidney in Aus-
tralia but little more than from Can-
ton.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rev. William Ellis, an English
Missionary, in his narrative of a Tour
through the island of Hawaii in 1823
thus states the comparative sizes of the
group.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Kaula
Molokini } little more than barren rocks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The order in which the islands are
named in the above table, is the same
in which they are situated in a line
stretching from the S. E. to the N.
E. excepting the island Kanai which
lies due west from Hawaii. There
is every evidence that the whole
group had a volcanic origin. On the
island of Hawaii there is now a
grand volcanic crater, which occasion-
ally sends out floods of melted lava.
The islands were thrown up from the
abyss of the Pacific so many ages
since as that a good depth of soil is
found generally on each of them, ex-
cepting Kaula and Molokini. Forests
abound in the mountains. The valleys
are excellent for the growth of sugar
cane, which was found to be indigi-
nous, growing very large without
under cultivation. It has since been brought
under cultivation with the best results.
A root, called by the islanders taro,
which is the arum esculentum a-
bounds on the islands, and has from time
immemorial been the staff of life to the
natives, until latterly they have learn-
ed to rely as much, if not more, upon
other food. They also have a kind of
sweet potatoe which grows very large,
and would appear to be about as rich
in saccharine matter as the white sweet
potatoe of Siam. Bread-fruit, cocoanut,
banana, Ohilo (a berry, Ohia a juicy
red apple) arrowroot, strawberry, and
raspberry are the principal indigenous
fruits of the islands. Oranges, limes,
citrons, grapes, pine apples, pa paw ap-
ples, cucumbers, and watermellons
had been introduced as early as 1823.
Beans, onions, pumpkins, and cab-
bages, seem to have been added to
the vegetables since.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the time of the discovery of the
Islands there were only three kinds
of quadrupeds to be found on them—viz.,
a species of hog, a small lizard, and an
animal a little larger than a mouse.
The hogs, being wild, were sometimes
ferocious; but with this exception and
a small centipede, there was nothing
among animals “to hurt or destroy
on the islands. Goats, sheep, horses,
and cattle were brought there from
California, and the latter were abun-
dant as early as 1823. Sheep thrive
well on the mountain sides but not
on the plains as it is there are too warm.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are but few land birds, among
which are enumerated a kind of owl,
a purple paraquet, red, yellow, and green
woodpeckers, wild geese, and ducks.
The feathers of the woodpecker were
in great repute for decorating the
helmets and cloaks of the chiefs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The climate of the islands is excel-
lent. “Much of the weather at all
seasons is delightful; the sky cloud-
less, the atmosphere clear and bracing.
Nothing can exceed the brilliancy of
the moonlight nights.” Thunder
storms are of the most agreeable kind,
very rarely heavy, or at all fearful.
And hurricanes are unknown. “The
general temperature of the islands ap-
proaches near the point regarded by
physiologists as most conducive to
health and longevity.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following Meteorological table
kept by the American Missionaries
gives much information in regard to
the climate. The thermometrical ob-
servations were noted at 8 A. M.
3 P. M. and 8 P. M.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The Murder Case.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Judge Koon Klang has replied to
our report of the murder of a priest at
Wat Sangkachai, and we have just
published his letter in our last issue
of the Siamese Recorder. He admits
that the murder did indeed occur at
the place and time reported, but de-
nies that he ever received any bribe
for the liberation of the prisoners, and
affirms that they have not been liberat-
ed, but are still held as prisoners,
awaiting a more thorough trial of the
case. The Judge unwittingly reveals a
great weakness in the Siamese Judi-
ciary, by saying that the trial of the
case has been thus long deferred be-
cause many persons who should appear
as witnesses have fled from their homes
beyond call of the court in fear of the
vindictiveness of the powerful friends
of the prisoners in case they should be
required to give their testimony. In
our Siamese paper we have taken
notice of this imbecility of the Judi-
ciary system, and have expressed our
fears that it but too plainly shows that
the courts of Siam are so loose in their
parts as to incapacitate them for trust-
worthy service, like a watch rattling
about in its case-—pins out-—balance
wheel unsteady—-and consequently
stopping, and then going most unfaith-
fully to the great annoyance of its
possessor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As the Judge does not deny that
money was paid to somebody by the
friends of the prisoners, and thinking
that he might perhaps hope to clear
himself of guilt in the matter by say-
ing that he did not receive the money
or that it was not received as a bribe,
we took occasion to say in reply to
him that any money received either
by the Judge or his assistants from
the friends of either party while the
suit was ponding, would by all right-
eous laws be accounted a bribe, and
would be condemned as an outrage of
Justice, and render the recipient of
such money liable to severe punish-
ment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That letter of the Judge also brings
out into clear light the terrible power
this people, especially the more infla-
ential, have to silence faithful witness-
ing in their courts of judicature. To
give in faithful testimony in these
courts often proves to be the opening
of flood-gates of apprehension and
sorrow upon the persons, families
and relatives of the witnessess; and it
is so dreadful in the anticipation as to
lead those liable to be suspensed to
flee their homes and hide as it were
in the wilderness or "in dens and
caves of the earth" from an approach-
ing trial like the one we are contem-
plating. There seems to be no pow-
er in the government to controal or
check this power of reeking person-
al vengeance on men, especially those
who witness against wrong doing.
The fear of it runs through all grades
of society from the highest to the low-
est, so that it is next to impossible to
get even an hired man or woman to
testify of any wrong action in a fellow
servant however truthful the testimony
rendered might be, or however much
needed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We understand that the govern-
ment has been waked up by car re-
port of that case of murder, and that
the prospect is, that something thorough
will be done in regard to it. There
does not seem to be any reason to
doubt that the prisoners were about the
same as liberated, and that the people in
the neighborhood had much reason to
think that the trial of the murderers
was to be dropped, and thus Robbery
and Murder be left to run rampant and
wild among them.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The late Eclipse.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The natives had been anticipating
much fun on the evening of the 21st
inst. as they had been informed that
the moon would on that eve. at 7
49 o'clock, be totally eclipsed, and
would be visible at Bangkok, provi-
ded of course that the clouds should
be propitious. This event, always to
them exciting, they knew was to occur
in the wettest of the wet season, and
the past week had shown a remar-
kable predilection for the evening time as
being the best for pouring down
rain. But the evening previous being
an exception, with the moon shining
in great glory, the people calculated
that that gracious dispensation would
almost of course be continued into an-
other night. Hence many of the
would-be-learned young men, we fan-
cy, had learned by calculations (from
the Bangkok Calendar of course) the
time of the first contact of the penum-
bra—-the middle—-and the last of the
contact. And many of them who by
the flourishing of commerce these lat-
ter years have become affluent, at
least enough so to own and carry a
watch with much show of gold chains,
key, and seals, had no doubt anticipated
the hour, and set their time pieces by
the semi-monthly calendar we publish
in the Siamese Recorder; and not a
few, we presume, had determined to
turn the eclipse into an occasion of
gambling, as they do nearly everything
else, and had staked wagers with re-
gard to it. Others had got their gins,
drums, gongs, bells, and whatnots in-
numerable ready for making a great
noise at the temples and private dwel-
lings to show their sympathy for the
Queen of night in her hour of agony,
going down into the belly of the monster
Rahoo. And the more enlightened
while seeing no reason for the notion
about Rahoo could not well forego the
sport according to old and loved cus-
toms, had prepared themselves for len-
ding aid to the universal frolic.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But alas! there came up late in
the afternoon of that day portentous
clouds, surcharged with electricity, and
brought out the whole artillery of the
heavens into extraordinary action until
late in the evening; and never perhaps
was the moon more densely covered by
clouds than then—-so that every hope
of seeing her until after the eclipse
seemed by all to be lost. No native
appeared to have faith enough in his
calculations for the eclipse to act by
faith only. Nothing could be done
without sight. Not a note of the least
sympathy for the moon was heard in
any quarter until one third of her face
had emerged from the eclipse about half
past 10 o'clock, when the clouds broke
away just enough to show the disk of
the moon dimly. The few who had
managed to keep awake and on the
look out for it, were then convinced
that the moon had indeed been swal-
lowed up or down somewhere, and was
then being delivered, and that it was
high time to begin the demonstrations
of joy. Some of them fired guns,
others beat gongs, and some rang bells,
and fired crackers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The effort seemed sleepy and feeble
at the beginning; but it quickly woke
up the whole city, and there seemed
to be a great turn out, as it were to
redeem the time that had been lost in
doubting. The noise was so uproarious
and so unseasonable that the thousands
of crows roosting on trees near our
house were terribly scared, and flew
about in the dead of night in much
confusion, adding their notes ha ha
kalawa to the universal jargon. And
the thousands of dogs in the city were
alarmed and set up barking and howl-
ing for the space of half an hour.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Under this chapter we have the
following.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the coronation of the present
king prominent foreigners were invi-
ted to a public dinner, and the king
then intimated that he should adopt
the policy of enlightened nations.
Ship duties would be lessened so as
to encourage commerce. New canals
would be made. New roads opened
and the people would be left free to
seize on truth wherever found.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In many respects the king has fully
met the expectations raised at the
time of his coronation. The treaties
he has made with the western nations
have given an impulse to commerce
quite equal to the present resources
of the country. True, there are abun-
dant resources to be developed; but
this must be the work of time and of
improved production. Opportunities
to sell have been created, and when
the wants of the people are so multi-
plied as to become a strong impetus
to effort, the great valleys of these
beautiful rivers throughout their
length and breadth will rejoice in wav-
ing grain, the banks of the streams
abound in luxurious fruits, and the
highlands give pasterage and wood-
land that shall supply every demand
of a multiplying thriving community.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}New roads have been opened, new
canals made, others are being pro-
jected, and we see no reason for any
person or any nation to complain of
the king in these respects. He is in-
clined to listen to every reasonable
wish of all his friends, and to enter in-
to any scheme that shall add to the
physical perfection of his country.
His resources are limited, his wants
are multiplied, and none so well as
himself knows how difficult it is to
meet the wants of a community made
up of a great variety of character and
an equally great variety of opinions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The king was too long in the priest-
hood to love war or warlike imple-
ments. He has never given himself
to these departments. Nor is he dis-
tinguished for manner in any way.
He plunges "in medias res" feeling
that he himself can express his own
thoughts and convey his own ideas
better than any one can for him,
though he may not quite so handsome-
ly execute. The king is a self reliant
man, and when conviction really takes
hold of him he is not slow to act. He
is out spoken and fearless in the ex-
pression of his own sentiments, and
the accomplishment of his own pur-
poses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The king is an indefatigable man,
as full of business as the most business
like, as full of pleasure, seemingly, as
the most pleasure loving. We have
had weekly newspapers both English
and Siamese during the last two years
and the king has been at the head of
copious practical correspondents. His
articles are to the purpose because he
has spoken when he has had some-
thing to say, and could not hold his
peace. Few men writing from such a
standpoint would bear on the even
tenor of his way as he has done. He
is a Champion for the Buddhist reli-
gion now gasping in its death strug-
gles. He, an old man of more than
sixty, has within the last fifteen years
become the real father of more than
sixty children, and of course is the
champion of poligamy; yet with his
perceptions eclipsed by these, he sees
many truths strongly and clearly, and
is a fearless patron, where many who
have occupied positions, which ought
to command clearer vision are far less
clear sighted. How many times have
foreigners plead with him to muzzle
the press, yet he, conscious of his own
uprightness of purpose, and asking
for light, still forbears and patronises.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He knows how to reward merit and
remunerate favors. He has helped to
build both Protestant and Catholic and
Mahomedan places of worship. Not
because he would patronize these reli-
gions, but add to the advantages of
his country, helping all that shelter
themselves under the shadow of his
throne. He almost alone of all the
kingdom has given substantial proof
of gratitude for favors received. A
few years since he forwarded to Ame-
rica to Mrs. CASWELL, the widow of
the Rev. JESSE CASWELL his English
teacher, one thousand dollars, and a
gain to the same person still later five
hundred dollars. To Drs. BRADLEY
and CAMPBELL he has given liberal
presents as tokens of gratitude for med-
ical aid. He is characterized by gen-
erous subscriptions to aid benevolent
purposes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are sorry for him that there are
of many inducements to keep him
from accepting the truths of christian-
ity. We hope before it is too late,
he will break away from them all
Certainly in his heart of hearts he can
have no great reverence for that reli-
gion, that wor-ships a man, who made
no professions of power to save, who
could only reply when called to help
in extremity " tam boon tam kam."
The king thinks too much, knows too
much of the invisible and unseen, not
to be able to comprehend a spiritual
existence, that pervades all space and
possesses all power—-mighty to save.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The formalities of Buddhism and
the claims of iron custom absorb
much of the king's precious time, and
consume greatly his moneyed resources.
As some compensation, they bring the
king much among his people, and
give the people many opportunities to
minister to his pleasure and so become
personally interested in their sover-
eign and king.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He visits many places in his king-
dom, particularly, the Diamond City.
On these excursions, he takes the air of
a gentleman of many resources. He will
set out in his own steamer, the "Royal
Seat" (the first steamer built in the
country above play thing pretensions)
or some fine new made steamer—-tak-
ing many of his children with their
mothers and attendants, accompanied
by quite a fleet of steamers, occupied
by the prominent nobility, and be
away from the capital weeks with no
business but change, or meeting some
custom as the shaving of a top-knot. He
goes in all weathers and always safely,
seeming to have a charmed life. There
never has been a serious accident since
the introduction of steamers. Their
success has made the people venture-
some.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
For the Bangkok Recorder.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a pleasure occasionally, to leave
this vast city, with its noise and bus-
tle, and babel of tongues, and rusticate
for a time among rice fields, country
villages, and farm houses, and also to
try one's skill as a sportsman upon
flocks of birds. Ascending the Mei-
nam Chow Phya however, at this sea-
son of the year, when the water from
up the country is so strong down, as
to overcome all influence of the tide,
is a little like the Darkies road to Jor-
dan, a "hard road to trabel." On
the afternoon of Sept. 11th we turned
our back upon the city, and directed
our course as nearly North as circum-
stances allowed. But scarcely had we
passed Bangkok Noi, and the city,
and its palaces, and pagodas, were re-
ceding slowly in the distance, and the
sun was approaching so near the hor-
izon that every thing wore an air of
pleasantness when the rumble of dis-
tant thunder, and the appearance in
the west of a black cloud announe-
ed the approach of one of those dash-
ing rains, of which September in this
country is so prolific. We had barely
time to reach a raft of teak timber
moored some distance ahead, and pre-
pare. It rained, and rained without
intermission, and dashed in under the
attap covering which protected the
men, and some even penetrated into
our own rather comfortable quarters.
The cook tried to prepare dinner, but
the rain put out his fire, and he an-
nounced a failure, so we were obli-
ged to make the best of some cold
victuals, and retire to rest. The clear
and early morning carried us through
some Peguan villages above the city,
and which indeed may be considered
as part of its suburbs. Here most of
the rice pots, and water jars used in
the city are made, and the shops in
the vicinity of the kilns are full of
those wares.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Pakret, a short canal, about three
quarters of a mile long, cuts off a long
bend in the river. Here is another
Peguan village, and some floating
houses are also moored at the mouth of
the canal, occupied chiefly by China-
men.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Leaving Pakret we also leave for a
time the busy, noisy Chinaman, as be-
tween that and the old city, there is
but little for him to do, but wherever
there is water enough to moor a float-
ing house, and inhabitants sufficient
to justify him in starting a gambling
shop, there we find that same busy
John again.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Still for some distance further on,
the inhabitants upon the banks are
chiefly Peguans, who are the descen-
dants either of captives brought here
during some of the wars with that
people, or of those who took refuge
here when their country was attacked
by some of the other surrounding na-
tions. They hold the Buddhist reli-
gion, and are to all intents, and pur-
pose Siamese, still they have their
own temples, where the male portion
of their children are taught to read the
Peguan language. The bricks used
for building in the city, are made by
them, and the sand used for the same
purpose is fished up by them from the
bottom of the river. At a certain
place the river widens out, leaving the
water in some places only one and a
half, or two fathoms deep. In these
places the sand brought down by the
current appears to accumulate. Here
they moor their boats, and putting a
pole down at the side of the boat, a
man with basket in hand descends the
pole, and returns in a few seconds
with a basket full of pretty sand, drip-
ping wet, which is received by a per-
son in the boat. Having taken time
to breathe he again descends. At
Bangsai, the Rahsang branch joins.
At this season of the year the river in
most places is overflowing its banks,
and where the banks are free from
jungle a magnificent view of the rice
fields is obtained, which promise an
abundant crop. The water, however,
is said not to be as high as it usually
is at this season of the year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The old city Ayuthia is situated at
the junction of several minor branches
of this great river. In approaching it
from any direction it presents but a
dismal appearance. It was destroyed
about one hundred years ago, by the
Burmese, but the old walls are still in
many places visible, and the ruins of
many of the temples and pagodas, al-
though built of no more durable ma-
terial than brick and mortar, are still
in a considerable state of preservation.
But they are grown over with weeds,
and tall grass so that it is next to im-
possible to approach them, and they
are apparently the habitation of bats,
reptiles &c. The devastation of the
Burmese must have been thorough.
Although holding the Buddhist reli-
gion, in common with the Siamese,
not a temple even appears to have es-
caped them for miles around. The
modern city consists chiefly of float-
ing houses in the creeks, and canals.
It would be difficult to tell the num-
ber of inhabitants, but might be gues-
sed to be about 25,000, many of
whom are Chinese. The principle
objects of interest are a large temple,
on the south side of the city, and said
to occupy the site of the Burmese
camp, during the siege, and is celebra-
ted for the number of its idols, which
are estimated by some, as high as ten
or fifteen thousand. The Chinese,
and Siamese unite at this temple.
About fifty priests teach daily the
Buddhist religion, and here also the
Chinaman burns his joss sticks, and
worships the spirits of his ancestors.
The other object of interest is a vast
stack of brick and mortar, some three
or four miles, north of the city, called
the Kow Tong, (Golden Mountains,)
and well deserves the name, as it must
have taken a vast amount of labor,
and expense to build it. It was built
before the destruction of the City,
and instead of sharing the general de-
vastation, is said to have been even
completed by the Burmese. It con-
tains a base of about seventy five
yards square, and terminates in a spire
at the height of about three hundred
feet. The ravages of time however
are beginning to tell upon it. It is
sinking down in many places, the top
of the spire is inclining considerably,
and grass is springing out in many
places over it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sprouts of the Po tree too, that des-
troyer of all walls, and mason work in
the east are also coming out all over it.
This artificial mountain is said to be,
once a year, the scene of a gala-day,
which is partly a festive, and partly a
religious occasion. On a certain day
of the eleventh month, all the inhabi-
tants of the city, and surrounding
country flock thither, clothed in their
best apparel. Fathers and mothers,
young men and maidens, and little
children, all meet together. Many a
marriage has had its origan their. Ac-
cording to Siamese custom, the young
folks do not enjoy the same freedom
of conversing together that they do in
European countries; but when a young
man sees a lady who pleases him, he
marks her, and when the proper time
comes, he begs her of her parents.
This festive occasion therefore gives
the young men an opportunity, of
seeing all the fair sex of the city and
community at once.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From an elevated position on this
mountain, one obtains a magnificent
view of the surrounding country, which
is one vast plain clothed at this sea-
son of the year in living green. Green
trees upon their banks, mark the win-
dings, and twistings of the different
creeks, and canals, whilst the vast
plain is covered with growing rice,
lifting its head above the overflowing
waters. His Majesty, has erected a
palace at the old city, which he occu-
pies during the short visits which he
makes to the ancient capital of his
kingdom. Few better situations for a
great inland city can be conceived of
than Ayuthia. It is surrounded by a
vast extent of the best rice growing
country, and the facilities for irriga-
tion, in case of necessity are ample, so
that an abundant crop would be al-
most always certain. In the hands of
a few enterprising Hollanders, with
their diking, ditching, and canaling
propensities, a Queen city might be
raised there, fed by the richest coun-
try, and sending millions of produce
annually to the capital.{{< /news/text >}}

The Power of Conscience.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
H. W. BEECHER;
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not long ago a gentleman who was en-
gaged in the oil business had made some
twelve or fifteen thousand dollars, and
he concluded that he had made enough—-
extraordinary as it may seem!—-and that
he would wind up his affairs and come
home. I do not believe one of you would
have done it! Fifteen thousand dollars?
Why, that is just enough to bait the trap
of mammon! Well, he wound up his af-
fairs, and was on the point of leaving,
when he was met by a young man of his
acquaintance (I believe they both reside
in New York), who had invested six
thousand dollars, all he had, in an ex-
perimental well, and been boring and
boring until he had given out in dis-
couragement. And, coming to this man,
he said, “I shall lose six thousand dollars
if I am obliged to give up my interest in
that well;” and begged him to take it off
his hands. “I am selling out, and not
taking on,” says the man. But the young
man plead with him, and out of personal
kindness he said, “Very well, I will take
it.” In two days they struck a vein in
this well, and it was an immensely fruit-
ful well; and he sold his share for two
hundred thousand dollars. The young
man was present when the check was
drawn on New York for the amount, and
he felt like death, and mourned, and said,
“It is always my luck: I am always a
little too late.” And the man said, “You
may take ten thousand of it, if you
want.” The young man thought he was
jesting; but he assured him that he was
not, and said, “I will make it twenty
thousand, if it will do you any good.”
“Or,” said he, “I will make it fifty thou-
sand.” “Well,” said he, “take the whole
of it: I do not want it. Give me the six
thousand, and you may have the advan-
tage of the good luck.” And so he gave
the young man the two hundred thou-
sand. All of you that would have done
that may rise up!—-INDEPENDENT.{{< /news/text >}}

Boundary between Siam and

{{< news/text >}}According to the FRIEND OF INDIA,
Lieutenant Bagge of the Royal Engineers
who completed the demarcation of the
north east boundary between Tenasserim
and Siam during last dry season as far as
the Amya Pass, will proceed, to Bangkok
for the purpose of getting assistance there,
with which to recommence the work.
Lieut. Bagge requires elephants and
guides, which are more easily procured
from the Siamese than in any part of our
own territory, and will make an early
start in November, beginning at the Pak-
chan river our most Southern limit and
will work up northward to the pass.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Government should appoint a col-
league to accompany Lieutenant Bagge,
so as to be prepared for every contingen-
cy whether in the case of sickness or accid-
ent. Two officers can help one another in
case of either being temporarily disabled,
and the whole season's work is then not
not entirely lost.{{< /news/text >}}

A Thrilling Incident.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Returning from a visit to New Orleans,
we were fortansle enough to secure a pas-
sage in a steamboat with but few passen-
gers. Among the ladies, one especially
interested us. She was the	'widow of a
wealthy planter and was returning with
only one child to her father's home. Her
devotion to the child was very touching,
and the eyes of her old black nurse would
fill with tears as she besought her mistress
'not to love that boy too much, or the Lord
would take him away from her.'{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We passed through the canal at Louis-
ville, and stopped for a few minutes at the
wharf, when the nurse, wishing to see the
city, walked out on the guard at the back
of the boat, where, by a sudden effort, the
child sprang from her arms into the terri-
ble current that sweeps towards the falls,
and disappeared immediately. The con-
fusion which ensued attracted the atten-
tion of a gentleman who was in the front
part of the boat quietly reading. Rising
hastily he asked for something the child
had worn. The nurse handed him a tiny
apron she had torn off in her efforts to re-
tain the child in her arms. Turning to a
splendid Newfoundland dog that was ea-
gerly watching his countenance, he pointed
first to the apron, and then to the spot
where the child had gone under.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In an instant the noble dog leaped into
the rushing water, and he also soon disap-
peared. By this time the excitement was
intense, and some persons on shore suppos-
ing the dog was lost, as well as the child,
procured a boat and started off in search
of the body. Just at this moment the dog
was seen far away with something in his
mouth. Bravely he struggled with the
waves; but it was evident that his strength
was fast failing, and more than one breast
gave a sigh of relief as the boat reached
him, and it was announced that he had
saved the child, and it was still alive.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They were brought to the shore—the dog
and the child. Giving a single glance to
satisfy herself that the child was really
living, the young mother rushed forward,
and sinking beside the dog, threw her arms
around his neck and burst into tears. Not
many could view the sight unmoved, and
as she caressed and kissed his shaggy head,
she looked up to its owner and said— 'Oh,
sir, I must have this dog! I am rich; take
all I have, everything, but give me my
child's preserver!' The gentleman smiled,
and patting his dog's head, said—-'I am
very glad he has been of service to you;
but nothing could induce me to part with
him.'—-Lo. Co. NEWS.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Some people keep their magnifying-

emotion puts out its head, they catch it
and kill it, to look at it through the mic-

Do you know my friends, that you can-
not love and be examining your love at
the same time? Some people, instead
of getting evidence by runing in the way
of life, take a dark lantern, and get down
on their knees, and crawl on the bound-

they have crossed it. If you want to
make sure, run, and when you come in

most stupendous facts of divine wisdom,
power, and love; a religion involving subli-

life, and ennobling and consecrating all
life's humblest duties, its most trivial oc-
currences and occupations. A religion
not to be donned and doffed at pleasured
not to be reserved, for out of the way and
exceptional cases, as too sublime, too sub-

secular engagements, and among them the
commerce of the merchant prince and the

The Minister's Salary.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A worthy miller—-so Dr. Chaplin tells
the story in Dr. Dunbar's memoir—-was
once pained by hearing that the minister
was going away for want of support, the
church having decided they could no long-
er raise his salary. He called a meeting
and addressed his brethren very modestly,
for he was one of the poorest among these
comfortable farmers. He asked if want of
money was the only reason for this change,
and if all were united in desiring the ser-
vices of the pastor could they still keep
him. There was but one voice in reply.
The pastor was useful and beloved; but
the flock was so poor!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Well," replied the miller, "I have a
plan by which I can raise his salary with-
out asking one of you for one dollar, if you
will allow me to take my own way to do
it, I will assume the responsibility for one
year. Have I your consent?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Of course they could not refuse this;
although they expressed surprise, knowing
the miller to be but a poor man.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The year drew to a close. The minister
had been blessed in his labors, and no one
had been called on for money. When they
came together, the miller asked the pastor
if his wants had been supplied and his sal-
ary promptly met? He replied in the af-
firmative. When the brethren were asked
if they were any poorer than at the begin-
ning of the year, each one replied "No,"
and asked how they could be, when their
church privileges had been so mysterious-
ly paid for. He asked again, "Is any man
here any poorer for keeping the minister?"
And the reply was the same as before.
"Then," he said, brethren, I have only to
tell you that YOU have paid the salary the
same as you always did, only more of it
and with greater promptness. You re-
member you told me to take my own way
in this matter; and I have done so. As
each one of you brought his grist to the
mill, I took out as much grain as I thought
your proportion, and laid it away for the
salary. When harvest was over, I sold it,
and have paid the minister regularly from
the proceeds. You confess that you are
no poorer; so you never missed it, and
therefore made no sacrifice. Now I pro-
pose that we stop talking about poverty,
and about letting our minister go, and add
enough to his salary to make us feel that
we are doing something."—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

Intelligence of Animals.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Borlase says he saw a lobster attack an
oyster, who persisted in closing his shell
as often as the lobster attempted to in-
trude within it. After many failures, the
lobster took a small stone and placed it
between the shells as soon as they were
separated, and then devoured the fish.
Mr. Gardner, in his "Curiosities of Na-
tural History," states that he once watch-
ed a crab enlarging its burrow on the
sand; and about every two minutes it
came up to the surface with a quantity
of sand in its left claw, and by a sudden
jerk threw it to the distance of about six
inches. Having a few shells in his poc-
ket, he endeavored to throw one of them
into the hole; three of them fell near the
hole, and the fourth rolled into it. Five
minutes afterwards the animal made its
appearance, bringing with it the shell,
which had gone down, and, carrying it
to the distance of a foot from its burrow,
there deposited it. Seeing the others ly-
ing near the mouth of the hole, it imme-
diately carried them, one by one, to the
place where the first had been deposited,
and then resumed its original labor.
Gilbert White tells us of an old hunting
mare which ran on the common, and
which being taken ill, came down into
the village, as it were, to implore the help
of man, and died the following night in
the streets. A writer in FRAZER relates
of a hen, which had hatched several
broods of ducklings, that from experience
she lost all the anxiety usually borne by
those foster mothers by the indomitable
perseverance with which the young pal-
mipedes take to the water as soon as they
are born, and quietly led to the brink of
the pond, calmly watching them as they
floated on the surface, or dusting herself
on the sunny bank to wait unconcernedly
their return. Duges saw a spider which
had seized a bee by the back, and effect-
ually prevented it from taking flight;
but the legs being at liberty, it dragged
the spider along, which presently sus-
pended it by a thread from its web, leav-
ing it dangle in the air till it was dead,
and then it was drawn up and devoured.
An individual living in the square at St.
Mare's, Venice, has been in the habit of
scattering grain every day at two o'clock,
previous to which hour the birds assem-
ble in one place on the cathedral; and as
the clock strikes, they take wing and
hover round his window in small circles,
till he appears and distributes a few
handfuls of food. This, at all events,
indicates the faculty of noting time, and
may be placed on a parallel with the
story of the dog who went to church re-
gularly every Sunday at the proper hour
to meet his master. Animals are prompt
at using their experience in reference to
things from which they have suffered
pain or annoyance. Grant mentions an
orang outang which, having had when ill
some medicine administered in an egg,
could never be induced to take one after-
wards. Le Vaillant's monkey was ex-
tremely fond of brandy, but would not
be prevailed on to touch it again after a
lighted match had been applied to some
it was drinking. A dog had been beaten
while some musk was held to its nose,
and ever after fled whenever it accident-
ally smelt the drug, and was so suscepti-
ble that it was used in some physiological
experiments to discover whether any
portion of musk had been received by
the body through the organs of digestion
—a severe test of the dog's sense of smell
and capability of profiting by experience.
Strend of Prague had a cat on which he
wished to make some experiments with
an air-pump; but as soon as the creature
felt the exhaustion of the air, it rapidly
placed its foot on the valve, and thus
stopped the action. A dog having great
antipathy to the sound of a violin, always
sought to get the bow and conceal it.
Plutarch tells of an artful mule, which,
when laden with salt, fell into a stream,
and finding its load thereby sensibly
lightened, adopted the expedient after-
wards, and whenever it crossed a stream
slipped souse into the water with its pan-
niers; and to cure it of the trick the pan-
niers were filled with sponge, under which,
when fully saturated, it could barely
stagger. {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The intelligence is most remarkable
when experience seems to prompt a plan
of action, or where the animal devises a
connected scheme to effect some desirable
object; as in the case of a cow, which
having strayed into an open granary, con-
tinued its visits by drawing the bolt with
its horn. The Arctic wolves hunt to-
gether in companies, and if they meet an
animal which they have not the courage
to attack openly, they form into a semi-
circle or crescent, and rush down upon
it, till the creature, terrified by the num-
bers of its enemies, hurries over a preci-
pice and is dashed to pieces, when they
search out the body and enjoy the feast.
Halliday mentions a mason-bee which
had built its nest close to a window gen-
erally fastened with a shutter, but which,
when thrown back, lay so close to the
wall, that its nest was completely shut in.
To prevent this occurrence, it formed a
little lump of clay, which hindered the
shutter from fitting tight to the wall, and
left room for its own ingress and egress.
Jesse recounts the circumstances of some
rats destroying the bladder fastened over
the nose of an oil-bottle, and making free
with the oil by dipping their tails into it
and licking it off. Dr. Pelican saw some
rats engaged in the same manner round
the bunghole of a cask of wine, into
which, if the hole had been large enough,
they would doubtless have fallen from
intoxication. The same principle was
carried still further, and with an evident
knowledge of the law which prohibits the
occupancy of the same place by two
bodies at one and the same time, by the
dog which threw stones into the well, and
the fox which dropped them into the neck
of a pitcher, in order to get at the water.
Degrandpre put a monkey to the proof
by leaving on a table an open bottle of
aniseed brandy, from which the monkey
extracted with its fingers as much as it
could manage to reach, and then poured
sand into the bottle till the liquor ran
over. Cuvier tells us of an orang-outang
unlocking a door by trying a whole bunch
till it found the right key, and if the lock
was too high it fetched a stool and mount-
ed on it. Le Vaillant's monkey when
tired, used to jump on the backs of his
dogs for a ride; but one of them object-
ing to this mode of treatment, stood still
the moment the monkey had taken it
seat, and thus got rid of the nuisance.
This reminds us of the horses which are
run without riders in the Corso at Rome,
and which are harnessed with loaded
spurs, which goad them as they run; the
older horses having experienced that
their own speed causes the spurs to play,
have the sagacity to stop, leaving the
younger and less experienced beasts to
decide the race without them. These
instances, extracted from a work which
literally brims over with facts of a kind-
red nature, abundantly testify that those
creatures on which man has too often
looked with scorn, and on which he has
heaped indignity and multiplied suffering,
have mental faculties, emotions, and sym-
pathies, which give them a claim upon
our most tender regard, and render them
equally the subjects of profitable study
and the fit recipients of human kindness.
