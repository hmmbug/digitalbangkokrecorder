Bangkok 30th Dec. 1865.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The compliments of the season to all.
From the rapid flight of time, which brings
back continually hollidays, and festivals
and reminiscences to every one, even Bang-
kok is not exempt. It appears to us but
yesterday since we issued the first number
of our paper, and now the year is closing,
and the volume is complete. To us in this
monotonous city time appears, shorter
when we come to take a retrospect of it,
because, perhaps, that, we have nothing
that might be called big events to mark the
different portions over which we have
passed. When a ship starts out upon the
ocean, the headland which she leaves behind
appears for a time to recede but slowly and
still appears comparatively near although
leagues distant, because there is no inter-
vening object to show the real distance.
So upon the great ocean of time when no
great events, or revolutions, or changes
mark the months, and years as they roll
by, when we come to take a retrospect
they appear short.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But we have had some changes even
here. Some who entered upon the year
full of health, and hopes have been cut
down, and numbered with the dead. Some
have left our community for other places,
intending never to return, where others
have come in to take their places. Some
too who entered upon the year with high
hopes, and tolerable prospects for wealth,
have seen those prospects vanish, and have
been left to commence the world anew.
Still the year has been full of mercies to
all. Whilst some of our number have been
cut down, still the general health of the
community has been good. No pestilence
has stalked through our midst—cutting us
down in numbers, as in Egypt and some
portions of the continent of Europe.—-
Whilst therefore an all wise Providence has
not prospered us in business affairs as we
could have desired, still we have abundant
reason to think him for his services.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It has also been a year free of calamity
to the government in whose dominions we
lived. The health of His Majesty, the
Supreme King has for the most part been
good, and excepting Chow Paya Yomrat
the Lord Mayor no high official has died.
It has been a year of scarcity and high prices
in many respects, but there has been noth-
ing like famine which was apprehended—
no real suffering from want of food among
the lower classes, and now the end of the
year is crowned with an abundant crop,
which will give food to the eater, and reward
the labors of the husbandman, as well as
fill up the royal treasury.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now we must bid our readers adieu. We
must retire from the striped and make
room for our successor. We need not here
state our reasons for retiring from the edit-
orial department of the Recorder. Suffice it
to say that it has not been for want of pro-
per encouragement, nor from any conscious
inability on our part to perform the duties
of an Editor. Who is there, that doubts his
own abilities! We thank own readers for
their patronage and kind indulgence, we
ask again, the favor of the community for
our successor. And finally we as politely
as possible make our bow and retire.—{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
To the Bangkok Recorder
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Editor:—-I am one of the numer
ous family of Browns. You are probably
aware, or ought to be aware at least, that
there are three great influential families
which rule the civilised, and part of the
uncivilised portion of this terrestrial ball
viz—-the Smiths;—-the Joneses and the
Browns.  It is from the last of these that
I claim to have descended.  This family
is large and influential.  Some of them
according to the customs of the countries
in which they live are persons of family,
whilst others are only family persons.
Now I have thought that I might wield
my pen to some purpose by giving some of
the members of the family, to which I be-
long, a few words of advice, through the
medium of your paper.  This I trust will
tend to their general instruction and edi-
fication. Friend Titcomb in his admirable
series of letters, addressed to our Cousins
the Joneses, has done an excellent work in
lopping off "excrescences" and filling up
deficiencies.  Should I in my humble way
be the means of accomplishing half the
amount of good to my own family, my
highest ambition will be satisfied.  But
my efforts at present shall only be directed
to that portion of our family, which is col-
lected from the different parts of the globe
and brought together in this "floating
city." Although we are closely related by
the ties of kindred, we are nevertheless a
heterogeneous mass. Of this mass we find
the extremes perhaps in the consequential,
all-knowing, all-important and somewhat
domineering spirit of Johnny; and in
the ever inquisitive, ever prying, ever
guessing, and somewhat boorish air of a
Jonathan. Should I succeed in bringing
these extremes together into one more
harmonious compound, I shall certainly
have accomplished a great work. But any
thing I may say will not be directed par-
ticularly against any one individual of my
family, but against particular errors, and
peculiarities as a whole; and the hints
thus thrown out will be like the coat,
which any one whom it "fits" can put on.
But before entering upon my duty there
are some preliminaries, which it would be
well to settle. You may want to know
what are the standing, and qualifications
which justify me in assuming this respons-
sible duty. Suffice to say that I solemnly
believe, that with all the rest of mankind
I am descended from Adam. As to my
immediate ancestors I can confidently say:
I had a father, and grand-father; but far-
ther back I don't dare to go. Whilst too,
family distinctions are advantages; and
even necessary some places, I am free to
confess that I have never been raised in
that belief, and rather detest them than
otherwise. But here I shall not at all be
troubled in that line; for as far as can be
ascertained, we all stand upon the same
footing. We are all tainted to some ex-
tent with the mechanic or manufacturer.
Not even two, do I believe, could be found
free from such a taint to save the city,
were it brought into judgement. A few
lines from Saxe, although written for quite
a different atmosphere may not be amiss
here and may be equally applicable to all.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
"Of all the notable things on earth,
The queerest one is pride of birth.
Among our "fierce democracy!"
Abridge across a hundred years,
Without a prop t' save it from sneers—
Not e'en a couple of rotten Peers—
A thing for laughter, sneers and jeers
Is American ancestry!
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Depend upon it, my snobbish friend,
Your family thread you can't ascend,
Without good reason to apprehend
You may find it waxed at the further end
By some plebeian vocation!
Or, worse than that, your boasted line
May end in a loop of stronger twine
That plagued some worthy relation!
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Because you flourish in worldly affairs,
Don't be haughty and put on airs,
With insolent pride of station.
Don't be proud and turn up your nose
At poorer people and plainer clothes,
But learn, for the sake of your minds repose
That wealth's a bubble that comes and goes!
And that all proud flesh wherever it grows,
Is subject to irritation
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}I take character, therefore and not birth,
or wealth as the standard of a person's
position in society. I consequently con-
sider myself as good as any one, and con-
siderably superior to many. I consider
myself adequate to the position of sitting
at any ones table, and with any company.
My standing in society therefore I consider
sufficient to justify me in the task which I
have undertaken.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to literary abilities I make no great
pretensions, I am not like the English
Quarterly Reviewer, who knows more law
than the Lawyer, more physic than the Phy-
sician; more theology than the Theologian;
more poetry than the Poet &c. I am one
of rather mo?dest pretensions in that re-
spect, I know that Milton, and Skakespeare
wrote poetry, that Oliver Cromwell was an
Englishman, and William of Orange was
a Dutchman. I know when the battles of
Hastings, the Boyne, and Waterloo were
fought; and there probable bearings on the
destinies of Europe. Have read Sir Wal-
ter Scotts, and Dickens, Irving's Life of
Washington and Abbot's Napoleon. Should
any of you therefore doubt my ability to
instruct you from a literary point of view
I shall not join issue with you so fiercely
as on the other point. Having thus stated
my designs I shall bid you good night.
Should this effort not prove too much for
me, you may hear from me again at some
future time. In the mean time I remain
your obedient and affectionate Sister,{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The last night of the old year.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
BY CLAUDE.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Silence now is brooding like a gentle
spirit o'er the still and pulseless world.
Hark! on the winds the bells' deep tones
are swelling—'tis the knell of the departing
year. The departure of the old year, that
has brought with it sorrow and joy, is a
time memory and tears. Deep within the
recesses of the heart a spectre points, with
mournful look, to the joys of childhood pass-
ing away with the old year never to return.
He lifts the coffin lid of Hope, Joy, and
Love, and looking sadly upon their wan
and wasted forms, shakes his head mourn-
fully, saying, "Passing away! passing a-
way!" Its mark is on each brow, its shad-
ow on each heart. In its swift course it
waved its sceptre o'er the beautiful, and
they are not. It laid its pallid hand upon
the strong man, and the haughty form is
fallen; the flashing eye is dim. It trod the
halls of revelry, and the bright joyous voice
is hushed.  It entered the hovel of the poor
and removed a sufferer from this world of
sorrow and want.  Swiftly o'er the battle-
field it glided, laying its icy band alike on
the young and on the old.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How little one is apt to think, when en-
joying the old year, what the new one will
bring forth.  Perhaps the moon, which looks
so gladly down upon us while ushering in
the new year, will on the next anniversary
shed its silvery light over our graves.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The midnight hour was rapidly approach-
ing.  It was cold, bitter cold.  The few
who were out drew their overcoats and
comforters close around them and hurried
on to their cheerful homes.  From the prince-
ly mansions beamed a golden light, and fell
glistening on the pavement.  Graceful
forms flitted by in the mazy dance to the
sound of gay music, while the merry jest
was greeted with a burst of happy laughter.
The tired seamstress passing the brilliant
mansions clutched her bundle more closely
with her stiffened figures as she thought of
the few hard earned shillings soon to be
hers, and the bitter tears would rush to her
eyes as she thought how differently would
her New Year be spent from that of many.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}'Ah! she little thought, as she stood there
gazing with admiration at the fairy-like
forms flitting by the window, what a scene
was being enacted in the story above. A
pale, glimmering light streamed through the
window. The heavy damask curtains
were half drawn, the fire dimly smoulder-
ing, and{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent2 >}}"as each separate dying ember wrought its ghost

{{< news/text >}}upon the floor,"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}grim shadows seemed to play upon the op-
posite wall.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The death-like stillness was broken only
by the quick tick, tick, of the little silver
time-place. Seated in a deep elbow chair
was a man in the prime of life Some in-
ward emotion was plainly depicted on his
countenance. His dark hair was tossed
wildly back from his heated forehead, on
which the blue veins were traced with pain-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ful distinctness. His dark eye had a wild,
crazed expression. His right hand clenched
closely a written document; his left, tight-
ly clenched, hung loosely at his side.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He had forged to a large amount; but
this fearful crime was locked closely within
his own breast. The wife and daughter
little imagined the occupation of the hus-
band and father as they bandied gay words
with their guests in the rooms below.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A dying ember fell suddenly to the
hearth, and grotesque shadows seemed to
play on an old-fashioned picture suspended
from the wall, his heavy eyes were lifted.
It was his boyhood's home!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Swinging back in his chair with a stifled
groan, he thought of the time when he
roamed an innocent child through the fields,
over the meadows.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}"Again he is bounding over the hills

{{< news/indent1 >}}that girdle his childhood's home.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Or he stops to lave his throbbing head

{{< news/indent1 >}}in the waterfall's glancing foam.

{{< news/indent1 >}}He swings the scythe till the mellow horn

{{< news/indent1 >}}Comes echoing o'er the silken fields

{{< news/indent1 >}}of the green and rustling corn.

{{< news/text >}}But more than all did the picture bring
to mind the old homestead, where "across
its antique portico, tall poplar trees their
shadows throw." He thought of the New
Year then, when "great fires up the chim-
ney roared," and friends by the score sat
down to the sumptuous table groaning be-
low its weight. These thoughts rushed
madly through his brain. Low voices be-
neath his window seemed to bring him back
to the present. Quickly he leaped from
his chair and opened the door. The merry
laugh and gay music jarred painfully on his
ear, and quickly closing it he opened the
window. The cool air seemed to cool his
throbbing brain, but looking below at the
forms on the steps he distinctly saw a star
glittering in the ray of light from the win-
dow. His face grew more ghastly. Too
well he knew their errand as a merry peal
from the bell ushered them in. A low
knock aroused him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"A gentleman wishes to see you!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"In a moment," he answered, and step-
ping quickly to a cabinet, he drew forth a
revolver. The deep voice of the church
bell commenced pealing forth the midnight
hour.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He glanced out, all was calm, still, and
cold; muttering, "ere it strikes twelve the
New Year will indeed dawn upon my dead
body," he fired, and as the bell struck
twelve, the New Year did indeed dawn up-
on the marble face of the suicide.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The music and dance still went on, no
one heard the pistol shot—no one knew
while the sound of revelry was going on be-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But we turn from the scene of crime and
gayety, and look upon a narrow, crowded
street. The houses close together, looking
every moment as though they would fall
to the ground. Can it be we are only a
few blocks from the mansions of gayety!
Impossible! Yes, such is the case. In a
small room in one of these miserable build-
ings, we see tossing upon a bed, a pale,
enaciated female, a torn bed-quilt scarcely
shielded her from the bitter cold. No car-
pet covered the rude uneven boards, and
the furniture consisted simply of one chair.
A monthly rose looked singularly out of
place on the window sill.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With open mouth the sufferer gasped for
breath. No one was there to moisten the
parched lips, no one to calm the feverish
brain, while in the frenzy of delirium she
tossed on the hard bed, murmuring inco-
herently, while the drunken shutters broke
the solemn stillness. The beams of the
moon struggled thro' the sufferer, who
would at one time, with calm voice, recall
the memories of bygone days, and forget-
ting the bare room, would seem to wander
in pleasant fields, while before her eyes
rose the home of her childhood.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again the fever returned, and with hoarse
voice and flushing eye, she would call loud-
ly for vengeance, and exhausted, sink back
upon her pillow of straw, with a hollow
moan, and with pigeons accents, beg to
be taken from that loathsome place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The delirium subsided, reason returned,
and clasping her hands over her breast,
with a smile of peace hovering round her
mouth, she died as the old clock chimed
the midnight hour—died peacefully, but
without a friend to close her sightless eyes,
or drop a tear over her pale corpse.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The New Year dawned upon scenes of
crime, sorrow, and happiness, and when
washing it, the spirits of the seasons
breathed in mournful cadences, that came
abroad like the far wind harp's wild and
touching wail, a melancholy dirge o'er the
dead year gone from the earth forever.{{< /news/text >}}

UNDER THE MISTLETOE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
A CHRISTMAS TALE
BY ELIZA SPEAR COOK.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Away o'er the blue waters, where the
stars shone down on the fair English house,
the Christmas chimes rang out on the clear
night air.  Aged couples, tottering down
the hill of life, guided by children and
grand children, stole up the sacred aisles
of the house of prayers, and knelt in rever-
ential awe and thanksgiving for the babe
born more than eighteen hundred years ago
in the Bethlehem manger, and raised up
their hearts and voices in praise.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}"While shepherds watched their flocks by night,

{{< news/indent1 >}}All seated on the ground,

{{< news/indent1 >}}The angel of the Lord came down,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And glory shone around, and glory shone around."

{{< news/text >}}Happy family circles gathered round the
merry yule log fires!  Happy hearts met
beneath the mistletoe, and happy young
heads nestled down mid the soft pillows,
peeping furtively though the half open door
toward the big chinnies, trying, oh, so hard,
to keep awake, and see the funny little man
they call Santa Claus come down and put
the pretty things in their stocking mamma
hung so invitingly near, and wondering
with the childish curiosity how said funny
little man can get over that big pile of
crackling logs, or coals, and not tumble in
and burn himself and chattels, or smutty
all the pretty toys.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two parties had met in the large old
handsome manor house of Sir Mortimer
Grant, one above and one below. Sir Mor-
timer and his good lady received with cour-
teous English hospitality the gentry from
far and near, who rolled up in their carri-
ages and were deposited for the one above.
Dame Ulrica, the house-keeper, and the
butler, her good man, received with as
much hospitality, though mayhap more
awkwardly proffered, the gayly attired lads
and lasses of the village who came tripping
into the great servants' hall for the one be-
low.  A grand band discoursed sweet
music for the graceful waltz or stately
minuet above.  The merry fiddler, in high
glee, capered among the dancers in the
lively reel, or merry country-dance below.
The gallant gentlemen bent most gracefully
to kiss his fair lady love beneath the huge
mistletoe above; and she as equally gallant
rustic, smacked the lips most heartily of
some fair village belle beneath another huge
mistletoe below.  Truly happy faces beamed
on happy faces, both above and below, that
merry Christmas Eve, in the spacious home
of Sir Mortimer Grant.  There was a big
plate of bright English sixpences, laid aside
for the Christmas Carol singers who came in
parties and sang the sweet words in honor
of our Saviour's birth-night without, with
the bright stars gleaming down on them;
then, by the kind invitation that is usually
given and expected, enter, partake of the
good cheer and the contents of the plate,
and depart for some other equally hospita-
ble house. Some times a party of young
men, fantastically dressed, so as to repre-
sent Old Christmas, the Old Year, New
Year, and the King, arrive, and in a species
of pantomime play, highly amuse the spec-
tators by their antics, and themselves after-
wards in glasses of beer or mulled wine,
and the contents of a well filled plate of
money, ere leaving the company.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among all this gayety, though there
was a sad look in both Sir and Lady Grant's
faces this Christmas Eve, five years before
that night they had turned from their
hearth and home a loved and only daugh-
ter, a beautiful girl, who had refused the
hand of an Earl's son, and given her heart
to an American; a Yankee adventurer, her
parents termed him, with neither fortune
or title to place him in their eyes worthy
the hand of their daughter; and when on
that night, Christmas Eve, five years before,
they both had knelt under the mistletoe
that hung in the great Castle Hall, and con-
fessed their love and their marriage. Sir
Mortimer, in a towering English passion,
ordered them from his door, never to enter
it again under penalty or his curse.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lady Mortimer was of the proud old Eng-
lish blood, and though she did not storm
and go into a passion, her back was turned
on the outstretched arms of her daughter;
and so out under the stars of that chilly
Christmas sky, the two had wandered over
the diamond frost-sparkling path into the
icy covered church, and kneeling before the
alter, those two loving but sorrowing hearts,
asked humbly of their Father in Heaven
for forgiveness of anything wrong.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A few days later an American bound
steamer bore the discarded aristocrat daught-
er and her noble American husband toward
his own fair New England home.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A letter, full of piteous entreaties for for-
giveness, from both daughter and son, came
over the blue ocean, and rested at last, in
the hand of the irate Sir Grant.  There was
a tender relenting spot in both father and
mother's hearts when they read the tender,
 beseeching letter of their beautiful daught-
er. They had sadly missed her—-sadly
longed for one more sight of their sweet,
gentle child, and had almost held out their
relenting hands over the broad sea to the
anxiously awaiting couple.  But not yet
would they bend their haughty hearts to
their child's flagrant act of disobedience.
Let them suffer and sue a litter longer—-let
another letter come over the waste of wat-
ers, then, perhaps, an answer would find its
way back.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another letter did come, but never
reached its destination, and so at last, des-
pairing of forgiveness from their titled par
ents, no more messages crossed the Atlantic,
and so it came to pass that beneath Ameri
can skies two young hearts could have been
entirely happy but for the forgiveness de-
nied them over the seas, and beneath Eng-
lish skies, two older, but prouder hearts,
mourned in secret the absence of an only
child, but could not bend from their haugh-
ty, proud decision.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"More carol singers. Bessy, mull some
wine, and fill the plate with copper
pennies, there is only two of them," and
Dame Ulric hurried from the finish of a
lively contra dance, to issue her orders.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A man and a woman's voice mingled in
the sweetest accord in the words of a beau-
tiful carol. No common voices theirs.
Every one paused to listen, both above and
below, and orders came from their masters
to conduct them, by especial invitation,
above, on their entrance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So Dame Ulrico nodded complacently
in the doorway, inviting their entrance. A
tall man, muffed in a big overcoat, and
slouching hat, holding in his arms a laugh-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ing-eyed, curley headed little girl: a slen-
der woman's figure, muffled in rich furs,
and deeply veiled, holding a chubby boy
by the hand, passed her and was conducted
up the broad oaken stairs, by the gracious
butler himself.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir Mortimer Grant and his wife were
standing under the mistletoe, in playful ban-
dinage of the time, long years ago, when
he had won her, the fair daughter of an

{{< news/text >}}When the strange carol singers entered,
there was a cry—a cry of long pent up
emotion, and the slight figure of the strange
lady singer was kneeling before the stately
pair, her veil thrown back, and her slender
hands held beseechingly up.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Oh! mother oh! father—-dear parents,

{{< news/text >}}And covered her face with her hands,
heart rending sobs burst from her lips, as
the tall stranger knelt by her side, supporting
with his strong right arm, his gentle wife,
his slouching cap falling off, and the hand-

looked pleadingly up.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Down on their knees the aged couple
knelt, clasping in one embrace their long

love you; papa and mamma love us too."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The guests stood by with sober faces, but
smiling eyes; the mistletoe swayed gently to
and fro above, dropping its slender green
leaves as though in blessing on the kneeling
group beneath. Dame Ulrico and her
good man, the old and honored servant,
stood smilingly arm in arm, waiting for an
opportunity to greet their young mistress,
while further back, gathered in groups, or
peeping through the doors, were the rest of
the servants, intermixed with the lads and
lasses, all anxious for a word from one who
had been loved and mourned through that
long five years of absence, and above all, the
tender peal of Christmas chimes stole in sub-
dued cadence through the rooms from the
old ivy-covered church, where five years be-
fore the young couple had knelt, asking for
forgiveness, and every one knelt involuntary
when the old gray-haired father raised his
hands in prayer and blessing over his
children, thanking God for the gifts he had
granted him that night; and all over merry
England no happier hearts were there than
had met under the mistletoe in the honored
home of Sir Mortimer Grant.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the holidays had been counted
mid things of the past, Henry St. Clair, the
American son-in-law, and his fair English
wife, embarked once more for the land of
Columbia, despite the tears and entreaties
of their titled parents, who would fain have
kept them by their own fireside. But gen-
tle Mary had learned to love free, fair A-
merica, and the beautiful home her loving
husband had borne her too, and though
she wept at parting from her loved parents,
nothing could have induced her stay, and
nothing reconciled the parents to this sep-
aration again, but the solemn promise that
every Christmas eve should find them all
reunited again in the old English mansion
of her forfathers, kneeling under the mis-
tletoe.{{< /news/text >}}

General Summary.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The new Ministry has quietly taken pos-
ession of power, with one minor office still
vacant, which Earl Russell is evidently in
no hurry to fill up. The discussion, how-
ever, about the balance of official represent-
ation between the two Houses still goes on,
and the Duke of Somerset is said to have
placed his resignation of the office of First
Lord of the Admiralty in the hands of Earl
Russell, in order to give the Government an
opportunity of appointing a Commoner in
his place. Whether this statement be true
or not, it is certain that modifications in the
Ministerial arrangements will be accomplish-
ed sooner or later. In Lord Palmerston's
time the preponderance of high official men
in the Lords was felt to be a great obstacle
to the progress of public business; but the
presence of Lord Palmerston, as first Min-
ister of the Crown, in the Commons was a
counterpoise which reconciled every body
to the inconvenience. Not only was his
lordship rigid in his attendance, but he
knew every thing about the Departments,
foreign and domestic, and spoke upon them
all. Now that the leader, whose universality
and adroitness enabled him to answer every
question with facility, and to manage the
House to everybody's satisfaction, is gone,
the case is altered. Earl Russell will find
it necessary to strengthen his hands in the
Commons; but whether he will do so be-
fore the meeting of Parliament, is one of
those contingencies which must be deter-
mined by circumstances.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Efforts are making in particular quarters
to show that the accession of Mr. Bright is
indispensable to the security of the new
Cabinet. It is said that, the country look
for this movement, now that the impedi-
ment of Lord Palmerston's presence has
been removed; and the people who say
this affect to be penetrated by a terrible
fear that Mr Bright cannot be prevailed
upon to accept office. They need not be a-
larmed, for there is not the remotest likeli-
hood that Mr. Bright will ever be placed
in the painful position of refusing to serve
the Queen. There are greater obstacles in
the way than Lord Palmerston, and the
greatest of them is Mr. Bright himself.
His notions upon Reform would set the
Cabinet by the ears, and his extreme views
concerning government in general would
bring down to the dust the strongest ad-
ministration that could be formed in the
existing state of parties. It may be taken
for granted that it is not in that direction
Earl Russell looks for new blood.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Shenandoah, after committing tre-
mendous depredations in the capacity of
pirate, has run into British waters, and sur-
rendered to the English Government. Here
is a new complication for England, upon a
point of international law which involves the
most serious considerations. To render
the whole affair still more perplexing, there
is some ground for believing that the cap-
tain is an Englishman. No step has yet
been taken, beyond that of placing a guard
upon the vessel; a precaution which is in-
dispensable in any event, while the law of-
ficers are exploring for precedents.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The published correspondence between
Mr. Adams and Earl Russell does not ap-
pear to improve the relations between the
two Governments, and the American journ-
als, even those of the most dispassionate
character, are of opinion that war must
come. This is not the general opinion
on this side of the water; but most people
regret nevertheless that Earl Russell per-
mitted himself so often to be betrayed into
outbreaks of peevishness and ill-temper. Of
the two parties, America had the best ex-
cuse for showing a little asperity, and
England was placed in a position in which a
conciliating spirit would not have been in-
consistent with dignity. But we have not
yet reached the end of the negotiation, and
there is plenty of time for Lord Clarendon
to make amends for the hasty tone of his
predecessor.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The news from the South is meagre, but
satisfactory. Business is being rapidly
revived, and Northern capital largely in-
vested. The question of labour still, how-
ever, engrosses serious attention, and fears
are entertained that the crops for several
seasons, pending the effectual organization
of free labour, must be far below their
former averages. In some quarters the
negroes are said to be discontented, idle,
and turbulent to an extent justifying fears
of an insurrection; but should any such
outbreak occur it is presumed that it would
be confined to some not very extended
locality, and would be speedily quelled by
the military. The Freedmen's Bureau
have, however, taken important measures
to prevent such occurrences.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The South Carolina Legislature has as-
sembled. The governor's message congra-
tulates the members upon the benefits
which will result from the abolition of
slavery, and eulogises President Johnson's
policy towards the South.    It also opposes
any act tending to the repudiation of the
State debt.  General Wade Hampton has
been elected Governor of South Carolina.
General Howard has announced at Charles-
ton that the Freedmen's Bureau will con-
tinue to exercise to authority until South
Carolina allows negro testimony in the
courts. The Georgia State Convention
has repealed the secession ordinance, and
appointed a committee to memorialize
President Johnson to release Mr. Davis
and other Confederate prisoners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Washington advices of the 25th Oct.
state, that the Hon. Caleb Cushing was
about to leave for Europe on an important
mission.  A New York telegram confirms
this statement, and says that the Hon.
Caleb Cushing leaves for England on Nov.
7, on a special legal mission connected
with the State department, the nature of
which has not transpired; but it is believed
to be in relation with the adjudication
made of the claims for damages by the
States on Great Britain for depredations of
the Alabama on American commerce. It
was believed that the government had ac-
cepted the proposition of Earl Russell to
appoint a commission to settle such claims.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The emperor set out on the morning of
November 8 for Cornerhonet, the estate of
the Princess Bacciocchi. His majesty will
be present at the meeting of the agricul-
tural committee of that district. Count
Bismarck had an interview with the em-
peror on the 4th of November, and left
Paris for Berlin on the 6th.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The emperor, in a letter to Marshal
M'Mahon, which has been published in a
pamphlet form, has expressed his views
on the Algerian question. Its concluding
paragraph, which we subjoin, is a resume
of the entire communication:-—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I would turn to account the valour of
the Arabs rather than bear hardly upon
their poverty; render the colonists rich and
prosperous rather than establish settlements
of emigrants; and maintain our soldiers in
healthy situations rather than expose them
to the wasting climate of the Desert. By
the realisation of this programme we shall
appease passions and satisfy interests.
Then Algeria will be to us no longer a
burden, but a new element of strength.
The Arabs, restrained and conciliated, will
give us what they can best give—-namely,
soldiers, and the colony, becoming flourishing
by the development of its territorial riches,
will create a commerical movement emin-
ently favourable to the mother country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is asserted that a private letter from
the emperor to King Victor Emmanuel
concerning the Roman question will shortly
be published.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There has been an election for the depart-
ment of the Upper Pyrenees. The govern-
ment candidates, MM. Larrabure and

at Bourg as member of the Chamber of
Deputies. He was the only candidate,
and received 21,526 votes.{{< /news/text >}}

Origin of the Water fall.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a well known fact that we are in-
debeted for many of our customs to the
heathen.  Especially is this the case in re-
gard to ornaments such as jewelry &c.
These are rather relics of heathenism which
cling to us.  The Waterfall it appears
originated with the Karens.  The late
Rev. A. Judson D. D. writing a number of
years ago from Burma refers to the
passion of that people for ornaments, and
the trouble they gave him in building up
the church, refers also to a visit to the
Karens where he finds the same passion
prevailing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"In the meantime I was called to visit the
Karens, a wild people, several days journey
to the north of Maulmain.  Little did I
expect there to encounter the same enemy
in those 'wilds, horrid and dark with o'er-
shadowing trees. But I found that he
had been there before me and reigned with
a peculiar sway, from time immemorial.
On one Karen lady I counted between
twelve and fifteen necklaces of all colors,
sizes and materials. Three was the average.
Brass belts above the ankles; neat braids
of black hair tied below the knees; rings
of all sorts on the fingers; bracelets on the
wrists and arms; long instruments of some
metal, perforating the lower part of the ear
by an immense aperture, and reaching
nearly to the shoulders; fancifully con-
structed bags, enclosing the hair, and
suspended from the back part of the head,
not to speak of the ornamental parts of
their clothing, constituted the fashions and
the ton of the fair Karenesses. The dress
of the female converts was not essentially
different from that of their country women.
I saw that I was brought into a situation
that precluded all retreat—-that I must
fight or die."{{< /news/text >}}

since our last issue is the starting of the

about the same time. It was perhaps
rather premature as paddy is likely to go
right up again. There is necessarily a
little rivalry among them, and also among
the agents they have taken up buying, which
has already given paddy an upward ten-
dency. But if buyers can stand it we
suppose others need not complain. The

The Shenandoah.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The notorious Shenandoah, one of the
Confederate cruisers which has been press-
ing upon American whalers so long after
the war was over, came most unexpectedly
into the port of Liverpool on Nov. 6, and
surrendered to her Majesty's ship Donagal,
the guard-ship lying in the Mersey. It is
said that the first question the captain of
Shenandoah asked of the pilot who boarded
him was whether the war was over.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This vessel, formerly the Sea King, was
fitted up as a Confederate cruiser when the
American struggle was drawing to a close,
and consequently she had comparatively
little chance of committing ravages upon
Northern shipping. After the close of the
war, however, having obtained a quantity
of supplies at Melbourne, the Shenandoah
appeared in the Oclok Sea and in Beh-
ring's Straits, and did infinite damage to
the whaling fleet. It is estimated that since
ler depredations in these seas began she has
destroyed in all nearly 40 vessels, the ma-
jority of them whalers; and it is known that
sperm oil has in consequence advanced
from £76 to £120 per tun. and that, owing
to the scarcity of this article from the de-
struction of these vessels, prices may ad-
vance from 25 to 50 per cent, higher still.
Captain Waddell, the commander of the
Shenandoah, states that the last vessel he
spoke was the Barracouta, from Liverpool
for San Francisco, from which he learnt
that the South was really and truly defeated.
On this he at once stowed away his guns
and ammunition in the bold, and steered
for Liverpool, stopping at no other port.
On arriving near the port, he took a pilot
on board, and finding the news of the de-
feat of the Confederacy was correct, he de-
sired him to take the Shenandoah alongside
a man-of-war, if there was one in the river.
The ex-cruiser was, in consequence, placed
alongside the Donegal, and a crew from
that vessel was placed in charge of her,
some custom officers being also in charge
with them. Captain Waddell was more
than once told, it is said, while cruising in
the Pacific, of the termination of the
war; but as his informants were the crews
of the Northern vessels he destroyed, he
persistently refused to give credence to the
statement. The vessel is closely watched
by the gunboat Goshawk, Lieutenant Cheek.
Captain Waddell, his officers, and crew all
remain on board, and no attempt at an
escape has been made. It appears that
Captain Waddell has in his possession a
large amount of money and valuables,
including a number of chronometers, which
he is anxious to deliver up, considering that
they are now the property of the United
States government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the night of Wednesday, Nov. 8, Cap-
tain Paynter, of the Donegal, liberated on
parole the captain and crew of the Shen-
andoah, by order of the Government.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Mr. Editor-—I am thinking that it
may be my duty to give you a little report
of my recent trip to P’etch’aburee and will
therefore take a few moments at this late
hour to write one.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having heard that my son-in-law Rev.
D. Mc Gilvray had been long suffering
from fever and was getting worse, I broke
away on the 18th inst. from my crushing
cares at home to visit him. And by the
politeness of Mr. Thompson and the kind-
ness of His Excellency the Chao Phya
Kahaoom, I accompanied the former gen-
tleman to P. which place we reached on the
20th. We were very happy to find that
Mr. Mc Gilvray’s fever had left him sev-
eral days before our arrival, and that he
was in all respects much better than we
had expected to find him, and with every
prospect of a speedy restoration to his health.
All the other members of the Mission, to-
gether with their children, were in the en-
joyment of good health. But our ever
constant and invaluable friend Prā-pālāṭ,
the deputy governor, we were very sorry
to find in deep affliction by the death of an
infant child, and the distressing illness of
his mother, whom he was highly honoring
by giving her his unremitting attention
day and night, scarcely leaving her for a
moment during all the five days of our
sojourn in the place. Her disease appeared
to be a de?y in the head, producing excru-
ciating pain and almost total blindness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His honor the Prā-pālāṭ expressed great
regret that he could not take time to give us
more of his personal attention. But he so
arranged that we had all our wants ade-
quately supplied in the way of horses car-
riages and men, so that Mr. T. was enabled
to execute all his purposes of Photograph-
ing on the palace mount, on the plains, in
the caves, at a distant Laos village, and at
other places. He made many beautiful
pictures of the very unique and charming
scenery in and about the city of P'etch'a-
buree.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We found the rice crop in that province
in the most prosperous condition, the yield
being full a quarter more than ever being
before, of excellent quality, and nearly all
reaped and stacked. The oxcarts were
just beginning to haul in the sheaves to the
threshing floors.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We returned on the morning of the 26th,
having urged our way home in 29 hours
by an oar boat with six men, hoping to be
in time to write by the "Chaw Phya" but
were too late by nearly two days.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In consequence of having been absent
from my business at home on an errand of
mercy to my sick son, I find that I shall
be under the necessity of postponing the
issuing of "The Bangkok Calendar" for
1866 about as many days, and beg that my
patrons in this most unprofitable enterprise,
will kindly pardon this unavoidable failure.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Just as our paper is nearly out of the
press we hear with deep sorrow that Rev.
C. A. Chulcott of the Baptist Chinese mis-
sion in this city, is still dangerously ill of
fever Friday 29th Dec. 3 o'clock p. m.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Wednesday the 27th inst. His Excel-
lency the Kralahome, gave a birth-day din-
ner on the completion of His E's. 59 year.
All the foreign consuls resident in B. (ex-
cept the French) were present, also the
Master Attendant, Com. of Police and a
few of the representatives of the large
firm here. H. E's son and brother, and Kim
Ching the Siamese Consul for Singapore
were also present. The dinner was mag-
nificent and such as is only to be had at
His Excellency's.  H. E's band was in at-
tendance, discoursing sweet music to regale
the soul, while the guests did  fall. justice
to the good things within.  Every thing
went off in first rate style, but owing to the
illness of the second King, there was no
theatrical performance, and the party broke
up at ½ past 8 o'clock.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The late Mr. Cobden used to tell the
following anecdote:— "When in America,"
said he, "I asked an enthusiastic American
lady why her country could not rest satis-
fied with the immense unoccupied territor-
ies it already possessed, but must be ever
hankering after the lands of its neighbours:
when her somewhat remarkable reply was,
`Oh, the propensity is a very bad one, I
admit; but we come honestly by it, for we
inherited it from England."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Reason Why.—Three or four times
a couple appeared before a clergyman for
marriage; but the bridegroom was drunk,
and the reverend gentleman refused to tie
the knot. On the last occasion he expres-
sed his surprise that so respectable a look-
ing girl was not ashamed to appear at the
alter with a man in such a state. The poor
girl burst into tears and said she could not
help it. "And why, pray?" "Because,
sir, he won't come when he is sober."{{< /news/text >}}
