President Johnson and the
Pardon Seekers.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}
At the President's reception on<br/>
Tuesday, some fifty Southerners were<br/>
present, most of them seeking pardons.<br/>
A Mr. Keitt, of South Carolina, (not<br/>
Lawrence M., he having been killed by<br/>
a loyal bullet at Fort Wagner,) ap-<br/>
proached the President, and informed<br/>
him that he desired a pardon. "What<br/>
have you done ?" asked Mr. Johnson.<br/>
"I opposed secession until my State<br/>
decided to go out of the Union, and<br/>
then I determined to go out with it—<br/>
I never joined the army. I did noth-<br/>
ing to bring on the rebellion," was the<br/>
reply. "You," rejoined the President,<br/>
"are like all the rest: you did noth-<br/>
ing. Now," he added, "my experi-<br/>
ence is, that the men who didn't join the<br/>
rebel army, but who acquiesced in the<br/>
rebellion, were the most mischievous<br/>
and dangerous men we had. I cannot<br/>
pardon you, Sir." Mr. Keitt made se-<br/>
veral other efforts. Among other things<br/>
he reminded the President that he had<br/>
come all the way from South Carolina<br/>
and had been in Washington sometime;<br/>
that hotel living here was very high,<br/>
and that altogether his daily expenses<br/>
were extravagantly large, and that he<br/>
would like to get away as soon as he<br/>
could go. The President responded<br/>
that the hardships of which he com-<br/>
plained were the direct results of the<br/>
rebellion; that he did not bring it on,<br/>
or contribute to bring on the rebellion;<br/>
that he was not responsible for and<br/>
could not extricate Mr. Keitt from the<br/>
difficulties he complained of, nor hast-<br/>
en his pardon on account of them.<br/>
The President was firm. His answer<br/>
was a finality. Exit Keitt. A Mr.<br/>
Birch, member of the late rebel Leg-<br/>
islature of Virginia, next approached<br/>
the President and applied for a pardon.<br/>
Similar questions were put to him by<br/>
the President as were asked Mr. Keitt.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
From the answers it appeared that<br/>
Birch did nothing, only as a member<br/>
of the Virginia Legislature, in obedi-<br/>
ence to instructions, he voted that<br/>
Virginia should secede from the Union<br/>
of the United States. That is all he<br/>
did, that was—" nothing." The Pre-<br/>
sident refused to pardon him. (Exit<br/>
Birch)—Next came a rebel clergyman<br/>
who asked the President to grant him<br/>
a pardon. "What great sin have you<br/>
committed that you come here in cle-<br/>
rical robes and crave Executive par-<br/>
don?" "I was a rebel," was the an-<br/>
swer, "and I desire your Excellency<br/>
to pardon me that I may be restored<br/>
to citizenship and be able to support and<br/>
live under the government of the<br/>
United States." "You rebel preach-
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ers," responded the President, "have<br/>
done the government a great deal of<br/>
harm. You have proclaimed devilish<br/>
doctrines and misled the people. You<br/>
forgot that it was your duty to yield<br/>
obedience to the powers that be.<br/>
You must rest awhile upon the stool of<br/>
repentance. I decline to grant you<br/>
pardon at present." Exit reb, clergy-<br/>
man. The President then remarked,<br/>
addressing the entire crowd in the<br/>
room, that it was a little singular that<br/>
most of the non-combatants who had<br/>
come here from the South for pardon,<br/>
assert that they did nothing, were op-<br/>
posed to the rebellion at the begin-<br/>
ning, only acquiesced, and thought the<br/>
rebel government ought to have sur-<br/>
rendered earlier and stopped bloodshed;<br/>
yet none of them took advantage of<br/>
the amnesty proclamation offered by<br/>
Mr. Lincoln, an act which would have<br/>
shown sincerity on their part, and<br/>
contributed so much toward saving<br/>
the enormous expense of life and<br/>
treasure. "I will grant no pardons<br/>
for the present," was the emphatic<br/>
conclusion of the President, and turn-<br/>
ing to Col. Browning, he directed him<br/>
to issue the order to the Attorney<br/>
General.—-Lorian County News.

The Crops of 1865.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The report of the Agricultural Bu-<br/>
reau for August is issued; but the re-<br/>
turns from correspondents in relation<br/>
to the crops, are only up to 31st July.<br/>
Calculations are, however, made from<br/>
the data received, and the result arrived<br/>
at is that the crop of 1865 will fall<br/>
short more than twenty-six millions of<br/>
bushels of that of 1864. The esti-<br/>
mate is thus quoted ;

{{< news/text >}}
In the New England and Middle<br/>
States, the loss is put down at 2,376,954<br/>
by heavy straw and too rapid ripen-<br/>
ing. In the Western and Northwestern<br/>
States, on account of rain, rust, and<br/>
chinch-bug combined, the loss is put<br/>
down at 2,864,744 bushels.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Rye and barley, it is stated, show<br/>
fair crops, but not so good as could be<br/>
desired. Oats are pronounced the best<br/>
crop ever produced. Corn is very prom-<br/>
ising, but there is apprehension of in-<br/>
jury from weeds in late planted fields<br/>
and bottoms subject to overflow. Sor-<br/>
ghum is represented as an average yield.<br/>
Potatoes look well, and promise heavy<br/>
crops. Tobacco is looking badly in<br/>
Kentucky on low lands, but well on<br/>
rolling ground. Flax is slightly in-<br/>
creased crop. Hay had been well har-<br/>
vested in the Eastern and Middle<br/>
States, and much injured in the<br/>
Western.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Tobacco is the only crop that shows<br/>
a general falling off, and the reason for<br/>
this is alleged to be the heavy internal<br/>
taxes on the manufactured article, and<br/>
the apprehension of a tax on the raw<br/>
material. The States this year which<br/>
have planted a larger amount of land<br/>
in this staple than last, are stated to be<br/>
Maine, Rhode Island, Ohio, Michigan,<br/>
Missouri, Minnesota, and West Vir-<br/>
ginia; New Hampshire is equal to last<br/>
year's planting, and all the rest under.<br/>
The report sums up the English<br/>
news relative to the crops on that side<br/>
of the ocean in this wise : “ Oats, beans<br/>
and peas will be short, but the hay is<br/>
abundant, and excellent, and the crop<br/>
of potatoes promise a large yield. A<br/>
good deal of old wheat will be found<br/>
unthreshed and unsold among the far-<br/>
mers, so that if the harvests are safely<br/>
gathered no unusual, supplies will be<br/>
needed.” The accounts from Europe<br/>
indicate that it will not have the usual<br/>
surplus to compete with this country<br/>
in the markets of Great Britain.—Lo-<br/>

Spots on the Sun.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
To the Editor of the Evening Mail.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
SIR,-—Your correspondent ' F. K. G.'<br/>
seems solicitous of some information<br/>
regarding a spot now visible on the<br/>
sun's surface. I would therefore beg<br/>
to offer the following facts regarding<br/>
this spot, which may be of interest to<br/>
many of your readers.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
This spot is not any of extraordinary<br/>
magnitude. Spots such as this are of<br/>
frequent occurrence, but the active<br/>
disturbance and constant change<br/>
which have taken place in this spot<br/>
during the past few days have been<br/>
very remarkable. To those of your<br/>
readers who are not familiar with the<br/>
nature of these so called sun spots,' I<br/>
would remark that the term spot, is<br/>
rather an unhappy one; it gives the<br/>
impression of being a mark on a flat<br/>
surface: This is not the case. It is<br/>
really an enormous hollow, with slop-<br/>
ing sides, penetrating entirely through<br/>
the photosphere of the sun, the black<br/>
part, or ' umbra,' being at the bottom,<br/>
and is supposed to be the real body<br/>
of the sun.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
On September 28th this black part of<br/>
the spot was rather more than 9,000<br/>
miles in length, while the greatest<br/>
length of the penumbra, formed by the<br/>
sloping sides, or penumbra, was about<br/>
29,000 miles. These sides were very<br/>
deeply furrowed from top to bottom,<br/>
very similar to watercourses cut by<br/>
the torrents in descending steep slopes<br/>
of a mountain. The sides terminated<br/>
to the bottom in long narrow promon-<br/>
tories of luminous matter, stretching<br/>
on to the umbra something like a comb<br/>
having thick teeth. The ends of these<br/>
promontories frequently broke off in<br/>
detached roundish pieces, which floated<br/>
away towards the centre of the um-<br/>
bra, and in some cases became dif-<br/>
fused and disappeared in the course<br/>
of half an hour or more. These chang-<br/>
es were very rapid on the morning of<br/>
the 28th of September. One of these<br/>
promontories I roughly measured to<br/>
be fully 1,000 miles long. On the<br/>
morning of the 30th of September<br/>
similar changes were taken place with<br/>
great rapidity, so much so that in two<br/>
or three hours the shape of the spot<br/>
had greatly altered the main part of<br/>
the umbra had extended to about 11,-<br/>
000 miles in length, while the penum-<br/>
bra had shortened to about 24,000<br/>
miles.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
In small telescopes the umbra of a<br/>
sun spot appears to be black, but in<br/>
the powerful telescopes this is found<br/>
not to be the case. In the present<br/>
instance the umbra was covered with<br/>
a thin mottled luminous stratum, ex-<br/>
cept in one place, where it was appa-<br/>
rently quite black, a fact that very<br/>
generally occurs in these spots, and<br/>
this part is termed the nucleus.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
On October 2nd I found that the spot<br/>
had rotated on its centre about 30 deg<br/>
since September 28th. This very singu-<br/>
lar fact has been before observed by<br/>
the Rev. W. R. Dawes, the well<br/>
known observer.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
In conclusion, I would further draw<br/>
the attention of your readers to the<br/>
great magnetic storm which occurred<br/>
a short time since during the laying<br/>
down of the Atlantic telegraph cable.<br/>
During this strom a very remarkable<br/>
group of spots broke out in the sun's<br/>
photosphere, and the termination of<br/>
this storm about coincided with the<br/>
disappearance of this group from the<br/>
sun's disc. It is well known that dis-<br/>
turbances on the sun are intimately<br/>
connected with the magnetic forces on<br/>
the earth; on this occasion the group<br/>
consisted of about 14 spots or umbra,<br/>
all included in one penumbra: the<br/>
greatest length of this penumbra was<br/>
rather more than 50,000 miles. I beg<br/>
to remain, Sir, yours, obediently.

Cash better than Lash.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The assertion that the negro will<br/>
not work except under the stimulus of<br/>
the lash is repeated every day by a hun-<br/>
dred Northern presses; hence the im-<br/>
portence of facts such as the following:<br/>
Charles F. Whitelaw emigrated from<br/>
Massachusetts to Mississippi in 1859,<br/>
settling near Aberdeen. He believed<br/>
that hired was better than compulsory<br/>
labor, but was not an Abolitionist, as<br/>
is evident from the fact that he bought<br/>
slaves to work his land. Immediate-<br/>
ly after the collapse of the Rebellion<br/>
he called his slaves together, acknow-<br/>
ledged their freedom and offered to pay<br/>
the men $15, the women $8,33 per<br/>
month, and the boys a proportionate<br/>
sum, if they would stay by him. He<br/>
also hired other negroes from the neigh-<br/>
boring plantations. His farm embraced<br/>
1,000 acres, of which 700 were cleared.<br/>
It was late in the season, but he prepar-<br/>
ed to raise a larger crop than ever; and<br/>
says a correspondent of the Chicago<br/>
Tribune, who visited the place, "today<br/>
(Aug. 12), as the product of the labor<br/>
of 50 free laborers, he has over 600<br/>
acres of cotton, while each negro has<br/>
his garden of sweet potatoes, corn and<br/>
other truck around his cabin—-Mr.<br/>
Whitelaw having assigned each one an<br/>
acre of ground free from rent." He<br/>
had been compelled to discharge one-<br/>
hand, and one only during the sea-<br/>
son. The rest had labored faithfully<br/>
and steadily. Few of them were wo-<br/>
men, the men preferring that their<br/>
wives should not work in the field,<br/>
but take care of the house and children.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Mr Whitelaw will probably make<br/>
for the labor of each man, the present<br/>
year a sum equal to his value as a<br/>
slave five years ago.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
One would suppose that such an<br/>
experiment as this, under the very<br/>
eyes of the former slaveholders, would<br/>
subdue their prejudice and convince<br/>
them of the superiority of free la-<br/>
bor. But Mr Whitelaw says thay are<br/>
incorrigible, and that the only hope of<br/>
Southern regeneration is in the enter-<br/>
prise and capital of Northern men.<br/>
The old slave-masters would rather<br/>
starve as idle "gentlemen" than thrive<br/>
as bursy workmen.—-N. Y. Indepen-<br/>

For the Bangkok Recorder
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
MR. EDITOR.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
I was glad to notice in your last issue,<br/>
that His Excellency the Prime Minister<br/>
had determined to build at Anghin, a<br/>
"SANITARIUM" for the use of invalid<br/>
European, and American residents in<br/>
Siam. His Excellency is certainly under<br/>
no obligations to the foreign community,<br/>
and it is to be hoped that any such free<br/>
will offering will be duly appreciated by<br/>
them. There is one thing however which<br/>
I desire to bring to the notice of the gov-<br/>
ernment officials. It is a well known fact<br/>
that when persons desire to take a tour<br/>
through the country, and ask letters from<br/>
the Foreign department to that effect, the<br/>
letters of different persons, have quite<br/>
a different effect in obtaining for them<br/>
the things which they need. Some who<br/>
start out find governors of provinces and<br/>
others ready to serve them at every step<br/>
they advance, whilst others, can scarcely<br/>
obtain the necessaries of life. For ins-<br/>
tance, some time since two gentlemen<br/>
were desirous of visiting a distant tribu-<br/>
tory kingdom; but knowing the impos-<br/>
sibility of doing so without peremptory<br/>
orders from the authorities here, thy ac-<br/>
cordingly obtained from the Foreign de-<br/>
partment what they supposed to be such<br/>
orders, and they started out upon there<br/>
journey. After about three weeks of hard<br/>
rowing they arrived at a certain stopping<br/>
place, and they presented there letter to<br/>
the governor.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
After reading the letter, he says "you are<br/>
at perfect liberty to pass on your journey.<br/>
But how were they to go? They asked<br/>
him for elephants, but he had none. They<br/>
could not even buy a food, [..] of<br/>
rice. They were completely at their wit's<br/>
end, and apparently at the end of their<br/>
journey. They however, became desperate<br/>
and told the governor that they would<br/>
go, and if he did not grant them the<br/>
privileges of transport, or otherwise, they<br/>
would start and walk to their place of<br/>
destination; an undertaking which would<br/>
have been extremely hazardous. At<br/>
length, however, a arrangements, or other-<br/>
wise, upon his own responsibility put<br/>
them through to the end of their journey.<br/>
Others have started on similar journeys,<br/>
and when they arrived at a certain stage,<br/>
they were obliged to come back. True<br/>
the nature of the presents given on the<br/>
way has much to do with the treatment<br/>
received. A box of gin has a marvellous<br/>
effect, even upon governors, in this coun-<br/>
try; but the insertion of one little word<br/>
by the authorities here, would have a<br/>
much greater effect. Some short time since<br/>
a company were desirous of stopping some<br/>
time at Anghin, and as there were ladies<br/>
in the company, they asked permission to<br/>
occupy a house there, which foreigners<br/>
had been in the habit of occupying.<br/>
When they presented their letter to the<br/>
chief in authority, he said the house was<br/>
occupied by Chinese workmen, and he<br/>
had no orders to put them out. He said<br/>
there was a large open sala there, which<br/>
they could occupy. This looked rather<br/>
more inviting than a house which had<br/>
been so lately occupied by filthy China-<br/>
men, so the visitors agreed to occupy it,<br/>
if he would give them something to en-<br/>
close it in, and make it comfortable, which<br/>
he agreed to do. The next morning he<br/>
sent down five small squares of matting,<br/>
to enclose a large sala; and asked on<br/>
which side they would have it. They<br/>
replied that it was not half enough, and<br/>
that European ladies could not occupy it<br/>
unless it was wholly enclosed. His reply<br/>
was, that it was all he could give. They<br/>
therefore were obliged to return home.<br/>
Now I would like to bring before the<br/>
officials the necessity of treating all Eu-<br/>
ropeans and Americans, whose character<br/>
at all warrants it, alike in this matter.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
They demand it and will have it. The<br/>
authorities must learn not to make "fish<br/>
of one and flesh of another." Some ar-<br/>
rangement should also be made either<br/>
here, or at the place by which a reasonable<br/>
or even liberal price could be paid for<br/>
these things.

A TRANSLATION
FROM A ROYAL DOCUMENT RECENTLY
ISSUED,
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
AN EXPOSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY
ROYAL
TONSURE FESTIVALS
OBSERVED FROM ANCIENT TIMES BY THE
SOVEREIGNS OF SIAM.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Princes and Princesses accounted as<br/>
suitable subjects for receiving the high<br/>
honors of the extraordinary Tonsure cer-<br/>
emonies, are briefly–the younger brother<br/>
or brothers of the king by the same<br/>
mother, named Somdeteli [?] Pra Chöw nawng<br/>
ya t’ö chöw-fa. Also the celestial sons or<br/>
daughters of the king called Somdeteli [?]<br/>
Pra Chöw löök t’ö Chöw fa-–also the<br/>
nephews and nieces of the king who are<br/>
born of parents both of whom are princes<br/>
of high rank.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
But it is necessary to be more explicit.<br/>
When a new dynasty is established, the<br/>
elder and younger brothers and sisters of<br/>
the new king are denominated respect-<br/>
ively P’ra Chöw P’eè-ya, P’ra Chöw Nawng<br/>
ya, P’ra Chöw P’eè-nang, and P’ra Chöw<br/>
nawng nang. These several princes and<br/>
princesses who are full brothers and sis-<br/>
ters of the king become respectively<br/>
Somdeteli [?] P’ra Chöw Nawng-yat’ö,<br/>
Somdeteli [?] P’ra Chöw P’eè nang t’ö and<br/>
Somdeteli [?] P’ra Chöw nang t’ö. But the<br/>
brothers and sisters of the king by a<br/>
different mother can be promoted to<br/>
such rank by the special favor of the<br/>
king. The children of the king which<br/>
he had by his queen or by his chief wife<br/>
before he came to the throne are all de-<br/>
nominated Somdeteli [?] P’ra Chöw löök t’ö<br/>
Chöw fa both male and female. The chil-<br/>
dren of the king by a Chawm manda–-or<br/>
a wife who was not a princess are not<br/>
Chöwfa–or celestial princes–-but only<br/>
P’ra-Ong-Chöws. But if the mother be<br/>
a distant blood relative of the king, or<br/>
be a child of a king of a small neighbor-<br/>
ing nation, or be a child of a nobleman<br/>
or ruler who had obtained extraordinary<br/>
favor from the king, such children can<br/>
be made or constituted Chöwfas, or cel-<br/>

TO ADVOCATE OF BUDDHISM.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We feel quite certain that we are,<br/>
in the providence of God, now called<br/>
upon to buckle on our armor to com-<br/>
bat with a very extraordinary man,<br/>
the most learned man among all the<br/>
Siamese—-the very Goliath of Budd-<br/>
hism—-he held by the New school Budd-<br/>
hists. We feel that in ourselves we<br/>
have no might against such a man,<br/>
standing as he does full two cubits<br/>
higher than any of the rulers, or prin-<br/>
ces, or former kings of Siam, with a<br/>
helmet not of brass only, but of the<br/>
best steel, and armed with a coat of<br/>
mail of the same metal, and wonder-<br/>
fully well wrought and apparently in-<br/>
vulnerable. And his legs are encased<br/>
in greaves, which it would seem not even<br/>
the swords, or spears, or bullets of<br/>
French arms with all the magical power<br/>
of a Nor Pun could hope to penetrate.<br/>
But Oh his spear looks frightful! And<br/>
his voice as he stands and defies the<br/>
armies of Israel seems terrible! But<br/>
there is a power infinitely higher than<br/>
he, and in his name we will approach our<br/>
antagonist with simply our steel pen<br/>
and the truth of the Most High God<br/>
calmly flowing from its slender nibs,<br/>
hoping that He will make that truth<br/>
mighty in combat with Buddhism's<br/>
most mighty champion.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Our antagonist in reply to our praise<br/>
of the Bible as being the best Book<br/>
—imparting more light than any other<br/>
book in the world (which views we<br/>
first issued in the Siamese “Recorder”<br/>
and afterwards in the English “Re-<br/>
corder”) appears to be greatly sur-<br/>
prised, and even ventures to ridicule<br/>
our high appreciation of it. He<br/>
affects to believe that the Bible is<br/>
in no sense a book to enlighten the<br/>
world, because it does not teach the<br/>
science of astronomy, nor shipbuild-<br/>
ing nor the power and uses of steam<br/>
as applied to navigation, nor the science<br/>
of calculating the latitude and longi-<br/>
tude of places, etc.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We will frankly acknowledge, at the<br/>
onset, that the Bible makes no attempt<br/>
to teach these or any other of the<br/>
natural sciences. While it often al-<br/>
ludes to them, and always in harmony<br/>
with all the new discoveries that have<br/>
been made in them, it never stops to<br/>
describe or define them. It had a far<br/>
more important light to impart to the<br/>
world, and that was a spiritual light.<br/>
The Bible, as we and all its friends<br/>
hold, was given to mankind to teach<br/>
them the knowledge and worship of<br/>
the true God, which they had lost in<br/>
the fall, and to show them how they<br/>
may be saved from sin and all its eternal<br/>
consequences. Now all the friends of<br/>
the Bible hold that the loss of the<br/>
knowledge of the true God produces<br/>
the most horrible darkness that man-<br/>
kind can suffer, and that a Book which<br/>
dissipates that darkness is the best of<br/>
all books. They also hold that the know-<br/>
ledge and worship of the true God is<br/>
eminently conducive to strength of<br/>
mind and a happy and prosperous life,<br/>
because those who endeavor to please<br/>
the living and Almighty God, will ob-<br/>
tain his peculiar blessing in body,<br/>
soul, and spirit, for he delighteth “to<br/>
give good things to them that ask<br/>
him” for them. And these good things<br/>
comprise, together with spiritual bles-<br/>
sings, all the ordinary blessings of life<br/>
among which are a rapid increase in<br/>
knowledge of the arts and sciences.<br/>
Hence those nations which are the<br/>
most thorough believers in the God of<br/>
the Bible, and receive that Book as<br/>
his own luminous legacy to a benight-<br/>
ed world, enjoy not only infinitely more<br/>
spiritual light and knowledge than hea-<br/>
then nations, but are also far before<br/>
them in all the arts and sciences.<br/>
While they do not learn astronomy, or<br/>
geography, or navigation, or steam-boat<br/>
building from the Bible, it gives them<br/>
intimate acquaintance with One who<br/>
knows the whole of these arts and<br/>
sciences, and of all others—nay is him-<br/>
self the sole author of them, and has<br/>
infinite stores of knowledge yet un-<br/>
revealed from which to supply all the<br/>
real wants of the race as they shall<br/>
occur during all the eternal future.<br/>
Having such an Almighty and all-wise<br/>
father, whom they love and honor, it<br/>
should be expected that He would<br/>
confer upon them much more know-<br/>
ledge and prosperity than He does on<br/>
those of his children who forsake and<br/>
forget him. And such we find he<br/>
does. Where can be found a more<br/>
notorious fact, than that the nations<br/>
that worship the God whom the Bible<br/>
reveals are the most enlightened and<br/>
prosperous of all other nations? Now<br/>
all the heathen nations that will not<br/>
acknowledge Jehovah as their divine<br/>
father, are still his children, and his<br/>
heart is still towards them, and it is<br/>
He who gives them all the good things<br/>
they enjoy. But He judges that it will<br/>
neither be good nor wise to favor them<br/>
as he does those who love and serve<br/>
Him; and hence the difference we al-<br/>
ways find between the two classes.<br/>
For such reasons we affirm that the<br/>
Bible is the great light of the world,<br/>
the Book of all Books.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Again.—The Maker of mankind<br/>
for good reasons may have chosen to<br/>
bring man into the world with but<br/>
little knowledge of the modern scien-<br/>
ces, yet giving him faculties of mind<br/>
to improve by his own diligent study,<br/>
and thus grow in knowledge continu-<br/>
ally and forever. He might have made<br/>
the first man an angel of light, endow-<br/>
ed with all the knowledge of Gabriel;<br/>
for He himself made all the angelic<br/>
hosts, and surely he could have made<br/>
mankind as lofty in intellect and power<br/>
as they. If our Buddhist champion<br/>
has good reason for ridiculing the Bi-<br/>
ble because Jehovah gave man at the<br/>
beginning so little knowledge as he<br/>
thinks he did, when He had an infinite<br/>
amount of it locked up in His own<br/>
bosom, there would still have been<br/>
substantially the same reasons for do-<br/>
ing it, had God created man with<br/>
knowledge equal to all that the human<br/>
race have since acquired or even angels<br/>
now possess, for there would yet have<br/>
been infinite stores in His own mind<br/>
that He had not communicated. In-<br/>
deed we do not see where such<br/>
a man could ever stop ridiculing<br/>
the God of the Bible until all the in-<br/>
finite depths and highs of the know-<br/>
ledge and wisdom of Jehovah had been<br/>
imparted to man. Hence it must be<br/>
admitted by all reasonable men, that<br/>
our antagonist is most unreasonable in<br/>
attacking the Bible as he does.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The Bible teaches that Jehovah is<br/>
the sole and only maker and proprie-<br/>
tor of all worlds, and that it seemed<br/>
good to him to make many grades and<br/>
ranks of intelligent creatures, and to<br/>
endow them with various degrees of<br/>
knowledge and power, giving them<br/>
facilities for attaining to still further<br/>
degrees of wisdom from His own<br/>
inexhaustible fullness ad infinitum.<br/>
And the reasonableness of this divine<br/>
plan, it seems to us must commend it-<br/>
self to every reasonable mind. God<br/>
holds himself as being the Father of all<br/>
mankind, and he speaks to man in the<br/>
Bible as a human father speaks to his<br/>
little children in simple language and<br/>
not in strict scientific terms. The<br/>
King of Siam, with all his praise-<br/>
worthy knowledge of the arts and<br/>
sciences, doubtless converses with his<br/>
own children in simple language.<br/>
When he speaks to them of the sun's ris-<br/>
ing and setting he uses popular terms<br/>
which suit the appearances of those<br/>
phenomena. He does not talk to<br/>
them as a philosopher might, and say<br/>
the earth hath rolled us round to see<br/>
the sun again; or more accurately, the<br/>
earth hath performed another diurnal<br/>
revolution on its axis so that the sun<br/>
appears to set. Suppose we should<br/>
ridicule the king because he always<br/>
talks to his children and to every body<br/>
else as though he were ignorant of the<br/>
first lessons of astronomy! Why, he<br/>
and all others would account us most<br/>
unreasonable. In what sense is our<br/>
Buddhist advocate less so in ridiculing<br/>
the Bible, Jehovah's simple and lov-<br/>
ing mode of talking to his little chil-<br/>
dren on the great concerns of their<br/>
souls, but occasionally alluding to mat-<br/>
ters that pertain to astronomy, geogra-<br/>
phy, navigation and other sciences in<br/>
popular language, which even the most<br/>
learned among men love to use?
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Again—The King of Siam knows<br/>
very much that he does not yet at-<br/>
tempt to communicate to his children,<br/>
because they are not yet prepared to<br/>
receive it. He sees that they must be<br/>
trained a long time, and their minds<br/>
expanded gradually many years, as his<br/>
own has been, ere they can come to<br/>
know all that he does. But enjoying,<br/>
as they do, extraordinary light from<br/>
christian lands, he ought not to think<br/>
that it will require 60 years' for<br/>
them to attain to all his own knowl-<br/>
edge. It would be reasonable for him<br/>
to expect that, should they attain to his<br/>
age, that they would stand as much<br/>
higher than he now does in general<br/>
knowledge, as he does above all his<br/>
royal predecessors.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The King also sees that his little<br/>
children do not in their childhood<br/>
need the hundredths part of the knowl-<br/>
edge which he now has, that their<br/>
slender bodies could not endure the<br/>
indwelling of such a capacious mind,<br/>
and that their relations to him and to<br/>
their own country do not at all call<br/>
for such precocity of intellect. In like<br/>
manner Jehovah, the Almighty Father<br/>
of mankind, sees that man is not pre-<br/>
pared to receive at once the vast stores<br/>
of knowledge that are laid up in his<br/>
bosom for him, and that it is far bet-<br/>
ter to impart those treasures unto him<br/>
very gradually, as circumstances in<br/>
the condition of the race shall call<br/>
for them, and their own relations to<br/>
the world make it necessary that they<br/>
should possess them. Hence Jehovah<br/>
has from the first dispensed to man-<br/>
kind of the treasures of his wisdom<br/>
very gradually, but always as fast as<br/>
He saw the real wants of the race de-<br/>
manded. We would love to illustrate<br/>
this grand idea by many striking facts<br/>
that have occurred in the progress of<br/>
the race, but we have now neither<br/>
time nor space.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Again—-Our Buddhist Champion<br/>
seems to think it quite ridiculous that<br/>
Jehovah should have made light to<br/>
appear before the sun. It seems strange<br/>
that he does not consider that a simi-<br/>
lar phenomenon occurs daily before the<br/>
sun rises and after he sets, and in the<br/>
wet season sometimes several days to-<br/>
gether, when not a ray of the sun is seen,<br/>
and still the day-light appears regularly.<br/>
He would have his readers think it<br/>
perfect nonsense to believe that every<br/>
herb and grass and tree was made<br/>
before the sun. But if Jehovah is al-<br/>
mighty, had he not power to make<br/>
day-light without the aid of the sun?<br/>
And had he not power on the fourth<br/>
day to constitute the sun and moon<br/>
the sole rulers, under him, of the day<br/>
and the night? But the truth is,<br/>
neither the original Hebrew nor the<br/>
common English translation from the<br/>
Hebrew of the 1st Chapter of Genesis<br/>
make it necessary to understand, that<br/>
Jehovah did not create the sun and<br/>
moon and stars until the fourth day of<br/>
creation. In the 10th verse of that<br/>
Chapt. we read that God said, "Let<br/>
there be lights in the firmament of<br/>
heaven", that is, let them appear there,<br/>
be seen daily fulfilling the offices for<br/>
which he had constituted them. In all<br/>
probability they were made before, but<br/>
from some cause had not till then sent<br/>
their rays through the remaining dark-<br/>
ness there was in the heavens. In the<br/>
10th verse it is said that "God made<br/>
two great lights" &c. Now Hebrew<br/>
scholars know well that the original<br/>
word translated *made* would be as cor-<br/>
rectly rendered *had made*, which would<br/>
seem better to suit the context, and<br/>
remove apparent difficulties. Now we<br/>
understand the Bible to give us in the<br/>
first Chapt. of Genesis an account only<br/>
of the creation, out of a chaotic globe,<br/>
of the firmament or atmosphere, the dry<br/>
land, the vegetable and animal king-<br/>
doms, and finally man. In the 2nd<br/>
verse we are distinctly told that there<br/>
was at the time when Moses began his<br/>
history a chaotic Earth, being the<br/>
ruins probably of the same planet at a<br/>
period innumerable ages before that<br/>
time. The first act of the Almighty<br/>
Spirit of Jehovah was to make day-<br/>
light to appear or light visible. We<br/>
may reasonably suppose that the<br/>
chaotic waters were then in such a state<br/>
of expansion as to absolutely fill all and<br/>
perhaps much more than all the space<br/>
now occupied by the atmosphere,<br/>
and with such density as utterly to<br/>
preclude every appearance of light.<br/>
But that first almighty act so con-<br/>
densed the vapors that some light<br/>
could be seen, somewhat as the sun now<br/>
gives light in a very dark and cloudy<br/>
day. As yet, however, there was no<br/>
division of the waters into that body<br/>
within the clouds and that immediately<br/>
enveloping the more solid parts of the<br/>
globe. This was done on the 2nd day<br/>
by the creation of the firmament, or<br/>
in Bible language the heavens. The<br/>
waters were then divided distinctly<br/>
into water in a condensed form as we<br/>
now find it, and into aqueous vapor<br/>
forming clouds. At the end of the<br/>
2nd day water still covered the whole<br/>
globe. But on the 3rd day, Jehovah<br/>
made the dry land to appear. In all<br/>
probability there was a globe of<br/>
earthly matter before. But on that<br/>
day God consolidated that earthy mat-<br/>
ter much as we now find it. The manner<br/>
of his doing it, Moses does not attempt<br/>
to describe. But there are strong<br/>
intimations given in other parts of the<br/>
Bible, that He did it by producing<br/>
tremendous convulsions (Psalms 104:<br/>
6—9) so that vast mountains and val-<br/>
lies were produced from the abyss of<br/>
waters. Consequently the water would<br/>
settle away into the immense vallies<br/>
leaving the higher parts of the globe<br/>
to become dry.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
On the same 3d day, or period of the<br/>
creation, before any ray of the sun had<br/>
broken through the dense clouds above,<br/>
God caused the earth to bring forth<br/>
every kind of grass and herb and tree.<br/>
Why should we for a moment question<br/>
his ability to do this without the aid<br/>
of the direct rays of the sun since he<br/>
could and did perform other creative<br/>
works only the day before equally<br/>
magnificent! How preposterous for<br/>
man—-puny, ignorant man-—to ridicule<br/>
the idea!
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
On the 4th day God caused the sun<br/>
and moon and stars to appear. As<br/>
we understand it, he brought the rays<br/>
of those luminaries down through the<br/>
deep clouds that had till then filled<br/>
the heavens, in some sense as he brought<br/>
the dry land up out of the abyss of<br/>
waters. As there was probably a so-<br/>
lid part of our globe that did not ap-<br/>
pear till the 3d day, so there was, in<br/>
all probability, a sun and moon and<br/>
stars long before thy were disclosed on<br/>
the 4th day; yet these were the works<br/>
of Jehovah, performed in the depths of<br/>
the Eternity past, which idea, we<br/>
conceive, imparts the greater majesty<br/>
to Him as creator. And the idea (which<br/>
the Bible favors and never denies) is a<br/>
most sublime one, to wit, that this<br/>
planet was made by Jehovah innumer-<br/>
able ages before the Bible history of it<br/>
commences, and that in those previous<br/>
stages of its existence, its maker had<br/>
His thoughts upon the human race<br/>
which He had then purposed to create<br/>
to inhabit it, and even then made vast<br/>
provisions of coal and oil and other<br/>
things which man would at this pre-<br/>
sent period need, and which He is now<br/>
opening up to him in all parts of the<br/>
world.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
With regard to the slur which our<br/>
Buddhist champion would cast on the<br/>
Bible on account of the supposed lit-<br/>
tle knowledge which Jehovah gave<br/>
Noah of ship building, we need add<br/>
but few words. The record which<br/>
Moses gave of the time and circum-<br/>
stances, shows clearly to our mind,<br/>
that God gave him all the knowledge<br/>
he then needed of the art. It seems<br/>
to us far better that he should<br/>
try to save himself and family and<br/>
animals of all kinds from destruction<br/>
by the flood, by means of an ark with-<br/>
out masts and hence without sails or<br/>
rudder, than to have done it in such<br/>
a ship as the “Great Eastern” with<br/>
the aid of every improvement which<br/>
modern wisdom has devised. Had he<br/>
had a ship like the latter, and all the<br/>
knowledge of navigation which the<br/>
best modern navigators now have, how<br/>
is it likely that he would have suc-<br/>
ceeded better than he did, having only<br/>
the power and mercy of His Almighty<br/>
Father to guide him, with the feeling<br/>
impressed upon him continually that<br/>
none but his Almighty maker could pre-<br/>
serve him and his family from a de-<br/>
luged world? It is absolutely certain,<br/>
that God preserved and guided the<br/>
Ark in the very best way, and that it was<br/>
far better for Noah and his family to<br/>
lodge on a high mountain in the re-<br/>
gion of his old home, than to have<br/>
drifted far away from it, and finally<br/>
lodged in some valley. By getting<br/>
aground on the mountain, he had the<br/>
advantages of dry land about 200 days<br/>
sooner than he would have had, had he<br/>
escaped entirely every mountain and<br/>
first struck on some vast plain.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Supposing Noah had had a steamer<br/>
like the Great Eastern, where would<br/>
he have stowed his wood or his coal<br/>
for steaming 150 days, together with<br/>
all the animals he was required to pre-<br/>
serve with him on board! How could<br/>
it have been as well for him to sail<br/>
hither and thither to see whether the<br/>
waters were dried up from the face of<br/>
the earth, as it was to send out a dove<br/>
for this object, guided only by Jehovah<br/>
and which would be sure to bring him<br/>
correct reports, and with the least pos-<br/>
sible amount of care or anxiety on his<br/>
part about it!
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
But we have already occupied quite<br/>
too much space in so small a paper as<br/>
ours, and must desist for the present.<br/>
Having, as we think, ‘demolished our<br/>
champion’s most powerful batteries<br/>
against the Bible, we fancy we shall<br/>
have easy work to make, in some future<br/>
issue, a finish of all others that have<br/>

The Siamese government has just<br/>
received from the Establishment of<br/>
George Forrester in Liverpool another<br/>
dredging machine by the "May Queen."
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
A Boat is now being made for it and<br/>
is under rapid progress. We were in-<br/>
correct in stating in our issue on the<br/>
13th that the government had then<br/>
two dredging Boats in readiness. This<br/>
one which we now report, being so<br/>
near an accomplished fact, we caught<br/>
up too hastily as being such. There<br/>
is certainly one Boat now complete,<br/>
and she is performing the duties as-<br/>
signed to her to the great admiration of<br/>
the government as well as the people.<br/>
Phya Sooriwong Wiyawat the only<br/>
son of H. E. Phya Kalahom has the<br/>
honor, as we understand, of intro-<br/>
ducing this great improvement into<br/>
Siam. Having witnessed the opera-<br/>
tion of such Boats in Egypt and oth-<br/>
er places while an attache of the Siam-<br/>
ese Embassy to Paris in 1850, the<br/>
thought struck him that such Boats<br/>
would be of great service in his own<br/>
country; and from that time he deter-<br/>
mined that he would exert his influence<br/>
to introduce them. He has thoroughly<br/>
accomplished the grand object; and<br/>
from this time onward we doubt not<br/>
that such Boats will increase in number<br/>
and power until the vast prairies of<br/>
Siam shall become checkered with<br/>
good canals, and the country by them<br/>
vastly improved. We are credibly in-<br/>
formed that the dredging Boat will<br/>
throw up on shore 10000 cubic feet<br/>
of earth in 24 hours.

There are now 84 square rigged ves-<br/>
sels moored in the river within the<br/>
city, forming an almost unbroken line<br/>
of merchant-men from the upper Fort<br/>
to the American Rice mill below, a<br/>
distance of four miles. They make a<br/>
fine appearance. Many of them are<br/>
trim waiting to be freighted with the<br/>
great staple of the country, as Siam is<br/>
becoming the great granary of South<br/>
Eastern Asia. We are glad to learn,<br/>
that the grain of the new Rice crop is<br/>
coming into market more and more<br/>
freely, and that there is every reason<br/>
to entertain the hope that in a few<br/>
days it will be abundant. As yet, how-<br/>
ever, the price of the grain shows but<br/>
little tendency to decline. We are<br/>
suspicious that holders of it are keep-<br/>
ing it back, hoping that they can do<br/>
better with it a month or two hence<br/>
than now. We feel quite assured that<br/>
those, who may be playing this game,<br/>
will in the end find themselves great<br/>
loosers by it; for all the probabilities<br/>
seem to be, that the market in China<br/>
will soon be well stocked with rice<br/>
from all quarters.

We are authorized to say, that the<br/>
government dredging Boat will pres-<br/>
ently be employed in deepening the old<br/>
canal around the city, and that when<br/>
that work is completed it will be em-<br/>
ployed on the canal now being excava-<br/>
ted from T'acheen River to Bangkok.<br/>
About two thirds of the manual dig-<br/>
ging in preparation of the dredging<br/>
Boat, it is said, has been accomplished,<br/>
and that the other third is steadily go-<br/>
ing forward. We may hence reason-<br/>
ably hope that we shall soon have 17<br/>
miles more of a beautiful canal exten-<br/>
ding to the charming country and great<br/>
sugar district on the T'acheen river.<br/>
And on one of its banks, let it be re-<br/>
membered, government is going to give<br/>
us a fine carriage road, when we, who<br/>
live on the West side of the great River-<br/>
Broadway of Bangkok shall enjoy<br/>
equal privileges of pony riding and<br/>
driving with our fellow citizens on the<br/>
East side.

We hear that some of the servants<br/>
of Europeans and Americans are suffer-<br/>
ing from anxiety in regard to the cus-<br/>
tom of shaving the head as a token of<br/>
respect for His Majesty the late 2nd<br/>
king that some, having shaved, are<br/>
now threatened with flogging for<br/>
having done so. We suspect that<br/>
some petty officers of government are<br/>
trying to extort money from the poor<br/>
and uninformed by this opportunity.<br/>
Those high in power should make it<br/>
plain to all, who should to go into<br/>
mourning by shaving and who should<br/>
not.

We beg in this place to correct<br/>
another mistake into which we inadver-<br/>
tently fell in our last issue, in saying<br/>
that the body of His Majesty the late<br/>
2nd king of Siam had been put into<br/>
a Copper urn. We have been in-<br/>
formed from the highest authority that<br/>
the interior urn is of solid silver and<br/>
the outer one of wood covered with<br/>
solid gold. Our informant adds that<br/>
the copper urn is in very common use<br/>
for the bodies of princes who are not<br/>
kings. None but kings are ever<br/>
honored at death with such an urn.

the throne. One of them was by a wife<br/>
who was a daughter of P'rabit Somdetch<br/>
P'ra p'oo't'i ya'wt-fa-Chulaloke whom<br/>
the then reigning king favored by giving<br/>
him absolute power as a king in the<br/>
war which then was. Concerning those<br/>
three Chowfas, one of them died when<br/>
quite young, and one of them died when<br/>
the then existing dynasty had passed a-<br/>
way. But the 3d ultimately became<br/>
Somdetch P'ra Chow lin t'o Chowfa in<br/>
the reign of P'rabit Somdetch P'ra p'oo't'i<br/>
ya'wt-fa Choolaloke. When the now dy-<br/>
nasty was established, there were two<br/>
princesses denominated Somdetch P'ra<br/>
Chow P'à-nang t'o who were Chowfa.<br/>
The elder of them had three sons and<br/>
one daughter but their royal father had<br/>
d'ied l'ong before. The younger celestial<br/>
later had three sons and two daughters<br/>
whose royal father had also died long<br/>
before. All these nine princes and<br/>
princesses the king was pleased. to<br/>
promote to the rank of Somdetch P'ra<br/>
Chow lín t'ò Chowfa. Afterward, the<br/>
king promoted the son of Somdetch P'ra<br/>
Chow P'è-nang-t'ô the elder to the<br/>
office of 2d king at the same time when<br/>
Somdetch P'ra Chow-nawng-ya-t'ô was<br/>
second king.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The supreme king at that time had two<br/>
sons and two daughters by a chief wife<br/>
whom he had before he came to the<br/>
throne whom he promoted to the rank<br/>
of Chòwfia. But the second king had<br/>
a daughter whose mother was the<br/>
daughter of the Rajah of Cheang Mòi<br/>
whom the king also honored with the<br/>
title of Somdetc'h P'rà-Chòw-lín-t'ô<br/>
Chôwfia. All the celest'al princes and<br/>
princesses in the beginning of the<br/>
reign of P'rábat Somdetch P'rá P'óot'i<br/>
-Yáwt-fa Choolaláwk were the follow-<br/>
ing vis—Somdetc'h P'rá Chòw P'ê-<br/>
nang—2 persons—but if we include<br/>
the P'rá-chòw-nawng-ya-t'ô the se-<br/>
cond king there were 3 persons who<br/>
were of the high'est grade. There were<br/>
four sons of the king titled Somdetc'h<br/>
P'rí-chòw-lóok-t'ô-Chòw-fa, who were<br/>
of the second grade, and there were<br/>
eleven royal nephews inclusive of the<br/>
children of the third king titled Som-<br/>
detc'h P'rí-chòw-lín-t'ô-chòw-fa, who<br/>
were of the third grade. There were<br/>
altogether of the three grades eighteen<br/>
princes and princesses inclusive of<br/>
Chòw-fa-lín-t'ô, the son of the king<br/>
of the T'onburee dynasty. And there<br/>
was also an aged princess, a Chòw-fa<br/>
who was the daughter of a king in the<br/>
preceding reign while Ayuthia was the<br/>
capital. She was still in full honor<br/>
as a Chòw-fa. Hence there were then<br/>
altogether nineteen Chòw-fas.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Among these there were at the be-<br/>
ginning of the present dynasty seven<br/>
Chòw-fas who had not yet received the<br/>
rite of Sók'an. These were as fol-<br/>
lows—three Somdetc'h P'rí-Chòw-<br/>
lóok-t'ô-Chòw-fas (not including the<br/>
elder) two Somdetc'h P'rá-Chòw-<br/>
lín-t'ô-Chòw-fas in the family of<br/>
Somdetc'h P'rá-Chòw P'ê-nang-t'ô<br/>
the younger princes; one Somdetoh<br/>
P'ri-lán-t'û-Chôw-fa in the family of<br/>
the second king; and one Somdeteb<br/>
P'râ-Chôw-lán-t'û, who was the son<br/>
of the Ton-burce dynasty. In the<br/>
childhood of the seven Chôw-fa liv-<br/>
ing at the beginning of the present<br/>
dynasty, there was no opportunity for<br/>
them to receive the full ceremonies of<br/>
the Sokan to which celestial princes<br/>
and princesses are entitled. Two of<br/>
them attained to a suitable age for<br/>
receiving the honor in the first year of<br/>
the present dynasty—the year of the<br/>
tyger the 4th year of the decade, Sia-<br/>
mese civil era 1144, corresponding to<br/>
the christian era 1782. Two others<br/>
attained to a proper age in the year of<br/>
the 'small dragon,-—the 7th of the<br/>
decade—-Siamese civil era 1147—-<br/>
christian era 1784.-—Two others reach-<br/>
ed the time of Sokan in the year of<br/>
the Cock—-the 1st of the decade, civil<br/>
era 1151—christian era 1789. The<br/>
Somdetoh P'ri-Chôw-lan-t'û-Chôw-<br/>
fa who was the son of the king of the<br/>
Tonburee dynasty attained to the age<br/>
of Sokan in the year of the hog—the<br/>
3rd of the decade—civil era 1153—-<br/>
christian era 1791. In the course of<br/>
those ten years the government was<br/>
greatly occupied with wars and conse-<br/>
quently no time could be spared for<br/>
the purpose of the Sokan festivals. The<br/>
ceremonies were made as short as pos-<br/>
sible, having barely enough for the<br/>
name of it.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
But there was one-aged princess the<br/>
daughter of one of the kings who<br/>
reigned in the old city Ayuthia. Her<br/>
name was Chôw-fa P'in-t'âwadee. She<br/>
had herself been honored in childhood<br/>
with the complete ceremonies of the<br/>
Sokan suitable for a Chôw-fa, and she<br/>
had witnessed the same festivals in<br/>
honor of her elder and younger bro-<br/>
thers. And hence she remembered all<br/>
the forms of the ceremony, and was<br/>
the person to hand that custom and<br/>
many others down from the ancient<br/>
times to the present dynasty. When<br/>
she saw that not one of those seven<br/>
Chôw-fas (above named) had received<br/>
the full ceremonies of the Sokan, and<br/>
that all suitable subjects of the rite<br/>
had passed away, she worried herself<br/>
about it greatly, and said that the cus-<br/>
tom of the Sokan was about to be-<br/>
come extinct. She was then quite aged<br/>
and thought that when she should die<br/>
there would be no one to trace out the<br/>
custom onward to a time when there<br/>
should be suitable subjects for receiv-<br/>
ing it, and said to herself who can<br/>
then give a correct discription of it.<br/>
She therefore set herself about giving<br/>
a full discription in writing of the<br/>
ceremonies of the Sokan, and then<br/>
explained it to many government men<br/>
stationed outside and inside of the<br/>
royal palace, and had them become<br/>
well versed in all minutim of the cus-<br/>
tom, that she might by such means<br/>
prevent it from becoming extinct.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The great anxiety and care with<br/>
which Princess Chôw-fa P'in-t'âwadee<br/>
was exercised received the approbation<br/>
of 2nd king of the reign of P'râbât<br/>
Sômdetch P'râ Pôôt'i-yâwt-fâ Choo-<br/>
lalokol and hence he made an artificial<br/>
mountain called Kris-lât with a tem-<br/>
ple on its summit, and made a pool<br/>
with the four animals sprinkling wat-<br/>
er into it after the fashion which Chôw-<br/>
fa P'in-t'âwadee had described. When<br/>
he had finished the mountain he re-<br/>
ported the matter to the Supreme king,<br/>
and begged that the king would be<br/>
pleased to confer the ceremony of the<br/>
Sôkan on a son and daughter of the<br/>
king's, who were born of a mother not<br/>
a princess, and thus promote them to<br/>
Chôwfas as though their mother had<br/>
been of the suitable rank for it, and<br/>
thus though it be a violation of custom,<br/>
it could be excused on the ground of a<br/>
stern necessity to preserve the festival<br/>
from extinction, while Chôwfa P'in-<br/>
t'âwadee should still be alive to see<br/>
that it was all performed in due order<br/>
according to ancient usage, and would,<br/>
moreover, have the personal observa-<br/>
tion of many witnesses, who would<br/>
thus aid to transmit it down to future<br/>
generations. The Supreme king granted<br/>
the request of the 2nd king while he<br/>
himself could not approve of the viola-<br/>
tion of the ancient custom above men-<br/>
tioned.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The 2nd king, having obtained the<br/>
permission had, the Sôkan festival held<br/>
within his own palace on three differ-<br/>
ent occasions—-Once in the year of the<br/>
rabbit—-the 7th of the decade, civil era<br/>
1157—-Christian era 1795—-Once in<br/>
the year of the horse, the 10th of the<br/>
decade, civil era 1160—-Christian era<br/>
1798, and once in the year of the cock,<br/>
3d of the decade—-civil era 1163—-<br/>
Christian era 1801.

The Fenian Object.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The object of the Fenian plot was<br/>
distinctly defined by two witnesses. It<br/>
was to subvert the dominion of the<br/>
QUEEN in Ireland, and establish a re-<br/>
public. The Fenian oath, also as ad-<br/>
ministered to members on admission,<br/>
as repeated by one of these witnesses<br/>
as follows:—-In the presence of Al-<br/>
mighty God I do solemnly swear al-<br/>
legiance to the Irish, now virtually<br/>
established and to take up arms when<br/>
called on in defence of its integri-<br/>
ty. I also swear implicit obedience<br/>
to my superior officers; and I take<br/>
this oath in the spirit of a soldier of<br/>
liberty, so help me God.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
When we look to the testimony ac-<br/>
tually offered as to the means at the<br/>
conspirators disposal, and the resour-<br/>
ces on which they relied for the dis-<br/>
memberment of the British Empire<br/>
and the subjugation of all other classes<br/>
of Irishmen to their own, we are cer-<br/>
tainly astonished at the madness of the<br/>
devise, but we must admit that Gov-<br/>
ernment was fully justified in inter-<br/>
fering as it did. Absurd as was the<br/>
scheme in its ultimate purpose, it pos-<br/>
sessed reality enough to work infinite<br/>
mischief in the country by destroying<br/>
confidence and banishing tranquility.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The Fenian Conspiracy, and we may<br/>
remark in passing that the Irish Gov-<br/>
ernment, appears to have been on the<br/>
alert for some time past, and to have<br/>
postponed its action only to a fitting<br/>
season. A police-officer deposed that<br/>
he received instructions to watch the<br/>
movements of the persons connected<br/>
with the Irish People more than twelve<br/>
months ago, and the drillings of the<br/>
Fenians were tracked and calculated<br/>
from week to week. There was no<br/>
lack of vigilance; therefore, on the part<br/>
of the Government, and its circum-<br/>
spection has now been rewarded with<br/>
complete success. The whole Feni-<br/>
an Executive, with a single exception,<br/>
is in custody, and the charges against<br/>
the prisoners have been so well substan-<br/>
tiated by evidence that their committal<br/>
for trial followed as a matter of course,<br/>
without objection or protest.—-Evening<br/>

Courting Two Hundred Years
Ago.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
—-Among the amusing reminiscences<br/>
of those days in the famous courtship<br/>
of the Rev. Stephen Mix, of Wethers-<br/>
field. He made a journey to North-<br/>
ampton in 1696, in search of a wife.<br/>
He arrived at the Rev. Solomon Stodd-<br/>
ard, informed him of the object of his<br/>
visit, and that the presure of home du-<br/>
ties required the utmost dispatch. Mr.<br/>
Stoddard took him in the room where<br/>
his daughters were and introduced him to<br/>
Mary, Esther, Christiana, Sarah, Re-<br/>
bekah, and Hannah, and then retired.<br/>
Mr. Mix, addressing Mary, the eldest<br/>
daughter, said he had lately been set-<br/>
tled at Wethersfield, and was desirous<br/>
of obtaining a wife, and concluded by<br/>
offering his heart and hand. She blush-<br/>
ingly replied that so important a pro-<br/>
position required time for considera-<br/>
tion. He replied that he was pleased<br/>
that she asked for suitable time for re-<br/>
flection, and, in order to afford her the<br/>
needed opportunity to think of his pro-<br/>
posal, he would step into the next room<br/>
and smoke a pipe with her father, and<br/>
she could report to him. Having smok-<br/>
ed his pipe and sent a message to Miss<br/>
Mary that he was ready for her answer,<br/>
she came in and asked for further time<br/>
for consideration. He replied that she<br/>
could reflect still longer on the subject,<br/>
and send her answer by letter to Weth-<br/>
ersfield. In a few weeks he received<br/>
her reply, which is probably the most<br/>
laconic epistle ever penned. Here is<br/>
the model letter, which was soon fol-<br/>
lowed by a wedding:

Northampton 1696.
Rev Stephen Mix: Yes.

Mary Stoddard.

{{< news/text >}}
The matrimonial mixture took place<br/>
on the 1st December, 1696, and proved<br/>
to be compounded of the most conge-<br/>
nial elements. Mix was pastor of that<br/>
paradise of onions for forty-four<br/>
years.-—N.Y. Independent.

Success of the Missionary
Cause
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Well meaning persons often express<br/>
doubts as to the success of missionary<br/>
enterprise. The following summary,<br/>
from the Morning Star, should send con-<br/>
viction to their minds. It is the work<br/>
of but a little more than half a centu-<br/>
ry.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
At the beginning of the present cen-<br/>
tury, there were no missionary socie-
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ties in the United States, and now there<br/>
are 100.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Then there were no missionaries a-<br/>
mong the heathen, now there are 3,000<br/>
and 7,000 native assistants. Then<br/>
there were no churches on the heathen<br/>
soil; now there are four thousand Chris-<br/>
tian churches where heathenism once<br/>
prevailed.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
There were then no heathen con-<br/>
verts; now there are 380,000 church<br/>
members of converted heathen, and as<br/>
many nominal Christians.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
There were then no Christian<br/>
schools; now there are 3,000 with 550,<br/>
000 children under the Christian in-<br/>
struction.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Then the Bible did not exist in a<br/>
single heathen language; now it is<br/>
translated into 120 of the most impor-<br/>
tant heathen tongues.—-American Mis-<br/>
