Bangkok June 1st.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Since our last issue we have received sev-
eral messages from Siamese Officials with
regard to the matter published and the ques-
tions discussed in our columns. We are
doubtless indebted for these attentions, to
our very amiable friend the Consul for
France. There is a very general rumour
through the town that this official has de-
manded of the Siamese Government the
suppression of the Newspaper published
here. We trust this rumour is without
good foundation. If we believed the report
we should be inclined to inquire if Siam
has already become a province of France?
If so, it would be indeed time for us, in
imitation of the Critic of the Emperor's
History of Cæsar, to seek a Brussels where
we may find an asylum from Imperial tyr-
anny. But until better advised we shall
consider Siam an independent Kingdom
having certain treaty relations, not with
France only, but with several European
States and with the United States of Amer-
ica. In accordance with these treaty rela-
tions we rejoice to know that we are not
under the jurisdiction either of France, or
Siam. Any suggestions coming from His
Majesty the Supreme King of Siam, or
from the chief officials, will always receive
that respectful consideration to which from
their high source, they are entitled. But
we must reserve the undoubted right of
exercising our judgement, as to what shall
be published in our columns, being only
amenable for any abuse of this right to
our own laws administered by our own
Consul in the exercise of his judicial func-
tion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We shall feel at liberty to publish any
facts coming legitimately into our posses-
sion, and to discuss freely the movements
of France in Siam and the East. In doing
so we shall endeavor not to forget the re-
spect due to the Official position of the
Consul for France, and shall rejoice to be
able to entertain at all times that respect
for the Consul personally derived from his
honoring the position which honors him.
But neither from us or from the Govern-
ment of Siam, can he claim any privileges
not accorded to the Consuls of the other
Treaty Powers, and we think we are right
in maintaining that with the existence of
other Treaties, each containing the most
favored nation clause, Siam can have no
private and confidential relations with
France; but is obligated to make known
to the other Treaty Powers any new agree-
ment entered into with that Government.{{< /news/text >}}

AMERICAN GENERALS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 82)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the age of seventeen the boy and his
father both began to feel that some decisive
steps must be taken towards his education.
The father perceiving his son's taste for
Military life began to think that probably
an appointment to West Point Military
Academy might be obtained for him. He
immediately wrote to a member of Congress
from his district requesting his influence in
securing an appointment for his son. The
gentleman in reply stated that he had already
an applicant from that district but said
there was a vacancy in a neighboring dis-
trict. This appeared to be the only chance
for Ulysses, and Mr. Grant wrote without
delay to the member for that district who
cheerfully proposed the name of the tan-
ner's son and obtained the appointment.
There was however another ordeal through
which the boy must now pass. Every
student when he enters must pass an ex-
amination in certain preparatory studies.
This was quite an ordeal for Ulysses con-
sidering the few advantages he had already
received, but he passed it safely and enter-
ed the Military Academy July 1st 1839.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}West Point is a beautiful spot on the
Hudson River fifty two miles above New
York. The Military Academy there is al-
lowed to have only two hundred and fifty
students ranging from fourteen to twenty
one years of age. Each one is paid wages
enough per month to defray all his expens-
es. He is thus enabled to pay all his own
necessary bills without having them paid
for him, and a manly independence is thus
cultivated, whilst the education is at the
same time gratuitous.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The cadets in return are required to serve
at least eight years in the service of the
government unless dismissed or allowed to
resign. Ulysses was here thrown among
the sons of senators, and congressmen, and
many others who were wealthy. They had
also, too, previously been at college or some
scientific school. Here Ulysses labored
under great disadvantages, for the only
previous education he had received was as
we have seen a few months of each year at
the district school.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The branches generally taught in a coun-
try district school at that day were Read-
ing, Writing, Arithmetic, English Gram-
mar, and Geography. With indomitable
perseverance however Ulysses succeeded in
mastering every recitation at the Academy,
and at the end of the Freshman year when
examination came, and many were turned
back he again passed the ordeal and entered
the higher class. At the end of the second
year he again passed whilst many fell back.
At the end of the third year he again pas-
sed and entered upon the crowning year of
his course. During his third year he also
received as a compliment from his compan-
ions the office of sergeant of the battalion.
Engineering he mastered by severe ap-
plication. He also perfected himself in
horsemanship and he is now one of the
best horsemen in the army. June 30th
1843 came, it was graduating day. Of the
one hundred young men who four years
before had put on the grey suit of cadets,
the tanner boy from the district school now
stands No. 21. Seventy nine of his classmates
among whom were the sons of senators,
and professional men were left behind. After
graduating he was brevetted second Lieu-
tenant of the fourth Regular Infantry, and
was sent to Jefferson Barracks near St.
Louis Missouri. The only active duty he
there had was an occasional expedition in-
to the wild country back of St. Louis, and
along the ruins to protect the inhabitants
from the incursions of the Indians. In
1844 he was still with his regiment up the
Red River in Louisiana. Months again pas-
sed away without anything striking in the
life of the young Lieutenant.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To please the slaveholders who have since
rebelled against the United States Govern-
ment the slave territory had to be impress-
ed. Texas then standing out as a "lone
star" was annexed to the Union. A diffi-
culty arose between Texas and Mexico in
regard to the boundary line. The United
States sent to the boundary an army of oc-
cupation under. Gen. Zachary Taylor. Lieut.
Grant marched with his regiment to Corpus
Christo where the troops were concentrat-
ting. He was there promoted by brevet to
the rank of first Lieutenant, of the Seventh
Regiment U. States Infantry, but he pre-
ferred to remain with his old regiment, and
requested Government to allow him to do
so, which was granted and he received his
regular commission of Second Lieutenant
of the Fourth Regiment. May 23rd 1846
active operations commenced. Mexico hav-
ing in the mean time declared war on the
ground that the United States had invaded
her territory. The first engagement be-
tween the the two opposing armies was the
short and bloody battle of Palo Alto. In
that action Lieutenant Grant won the ad-
miration of his superior officers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next day another severe battle was
fought at Resaca de la Palma, in which the
Mexicans were again defeated. Grant's
character as a true soldier again shone
forth with new lustre. Next came the
strongly fortified position of Monterey.
Another terribly severe, but successful en-
gagement ensued, Grant again fought despe-
rately. The city of Mexico now became
the goal of the United States army, and
Gen. Winfield Scott was appointed to
the command. Taylor's forces joined him.
Grant was appointed quarter master of his
regiment and given a place upon the Com-
mander's staff. Vera Cruz was soon taken
and the army entered the heart of the hos-
tile Country. Soon came the terrible strug-
gle of Molina del Rey, The young Lieut.
was calm and heroic. Ho rode so calmly
and recklessly through the storm of leaden
had that he was at once brevetted first
Lieutenant. Congress however is often
slow in recognizing true merit, so she re-
fused to ratify the brevet, and Grant re-
ceived the empty brevet alone. Five days
after Molina del Rey came the frowning
and strongly fortified heights of Chapul-
tepec. They must be stormed. None was
more daring in that action than Grant.
Capt. Brooks of the second Artillery re-
ports as follows. "I succeeded in reaching
the Fort with a few men. Here Lieut. U.
S. Grant and a few more men of the
Fourth Infantry joined mo and by a joint
movement and after an obstinate resistance
a strong field work was carried, and the
enemies right completely turned."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Major Lee, now Lieutenant General Lee
Commander-in-chief of the rebel forces, and
Grant's great antagonist reports as follows.
"At the first barrier the enemy were in strong
force which rendered it necessary to ad-
vance with caution. This was done; and
when the head of the battalion was within
short musket range of the barrier, Lieut.
Grant of the Fourth Infantry and Capt.
Brooks of the Second Artillery, with a few
men of their respective regiments by a
handsome movement to the left turned the
right flank of the enemy and the barrier
was carried. Lieutenant Grant behaved with
distinguished ability on the 13th and 14th.
Thus it may be perceived that even at that
early day he was renowned for flanking.
Little did Major Lee then suppose that he
would one day be arrayed against that
government which they were both then
serving with distinguished ability, and that
Lieutenant Grant would be his great an-
tagonist, and by those same flank move-
ments he would bring him precipitately
from Spotsylvania to the South side of the
James, and there hang on to him with bull
dog tenacity until he forced him to evac-
uate his stronghold. Grant was brevetted
Captain from the battle of Chapultapec.
He also participated in the taking of Mexi-
co having been in all the battles of the war
except Buena Vista, having fought in four-
teen engagements. Peace was declared in
1848 and the army disbanded. After the
war Grant married Miss Dent a sensible
young lady whose father still resides near
St. Louis Missouri.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He was afterwards sent to a post on
Lake Ontario where of course there was
but little to do, and he occasionally visited
a neighboring village where he was known
chiefly for his ability in playing checkers.
After the gold fever broke out in California,
and it was necessary to send some troops
there to keep things straight, Grant and his
Fourth Regiment were sent to the Pacific
where he received his full rank of
Captain.{{< /news/text >}}

FRENCH IN COCHIN CHINA.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 85.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Being now in possession of the three
richest provinces of the Annam kingdom,
we soon found the difficulties of governing
them, and it now became necessary to as-
certain the boundries, and to facilitate the
rich imports of trade, if we did not exercise
an influence in Cambodia, and to explore
the magnificent river of that name which
is fed by three great rivers, one of which,
the Laos, takes its rise in the mountains of
Thibet. The kingdom of Cambodia after
having attained as high a state of civiliza-
tion as China, has now fallen back into
barbarism, and for the last 200 years has
been in a state of anarchy, and at different
times she has called to her assistance the
arms of Annam and Siam. The Govern-
ment of Hue has profited by the frequent
aids, sent to Cambodia, and has assumed
the right of intermeddling with her inter-
nal affairs, and exercises a sovereignty
there more or less vigorous. The King of
Cambodia is invested by the King of An-
nam and pays him an annual tribute.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The kingdom of Siam, which borders on
Cambodia, has the same pretensions to
her, alhough their interference has often
been repulsed by the inhabitants. Our ar-
rival in Cochin China, our war with the
Annamites, and later still our taking pos-
session of the three provinces, appears to
have been considered by the Siamese, as
favorable opportunities, and they have very
adroitly taken advantage to annex to their
territories several provinces of Cambodia,
and arrogating to themselves the right of
solely electing the sovereign of that king-
dom. The King who reigns at Bangkok
has not succeeded in his claim, for King Tu-
duc has also laid claim to the sovereignty
of Cambodia, and has in reality exercised
great vigilance there, as it is the only
means of uniting those parts of that king-
dom, which he has joined to his territory,
and he baa agents present with his vassal
the King of Cambodia, who never does a
sovereign act without consulting them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We might be indifferent to the intrigues
of the Government of Siam; if left to her-
self she would give us no apprehension,
but it is from Bangkok that England watch-
es with jealousy the progress of our estab-
lishment in Cochin China. It has not
escaped her shrewdness, that in the Penin-
sula of Indo-China the preponderance will
be held by this nation who commands the
entrance of one of the most admirable riv-
ers of Asia, and the source of the richest
productions in the world. England has
the hold of the King of Siam, a prince of
Indian descent, and who is of that feeble
race which she is accustomed to manage,
and she has made him an instrument in
her antagonism against us. At present she
is content with opposing him to us, to re-
sist our influence; but should a war here-
after happen between her (England) and
us, it might be that power reunite in high
Cambodia means of attacking our provinces
of Mithio and Ga-dinh ? Two proceedings
of the Siamese Government make it our
duty to examine more closely that posit-
ion. The representative of the King of
Siam at Udong, (the capital of Cambodia)
wrote in Oct. 1862 to Admiral Bonard
asking him, when he meant to give back
the mouth of the river Bassai in Lower
Cambodia, to the Cambodians, he being
afraid to claim it directly in the name of
his sovereign.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Later the Minister for Foreign affairs of
the Court of Bangkok informed Admiral
Grandiere (who had succeeded Admiral
Bonard) of his intention to expedite from
time to time Siamese officers to Saigon,
and as his Government had only a few
steamers capable of doubling the Cape of
Cambodia, he wished to send them the in-
terior route, by the the canal of Ha-tien.
The illusion could not have been rnore
plain, and therefore it became necessary to
discover these nanoeuvres, which are clev-
er, but badly disguised European influence.
Being a man of spirit and resolution, de-
voted to his work, Admiral Grandiere, a
mongst other combinations of assuring the
stability of our establishment, adopted the
following resolution. To recognise tho
independence of Cambodia, and establish
her authority by treating her as an ally,
and by the efficacy of our aid rendering her
independent without other protection. The
occasion for adopting this policy soon oc-
curred.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A resident of Cambodia who had com-
mitted an offence against that state, took
refuge in our territory. The Minister of
the King of Siam, who had no business to
interfere, claimed the extradition of the of-
fender. This was refused on tho plea that
we did not recognise the protectorate,
which the King of Siam arrogated over
Cambodia, and further we considered Cam-
bodia being in our own Frontiers was in-
dependent, and that she should continue
to be interposed between our territory and
Siam The Annamite Government by the
cession of the three provinces of Lower
Cochin China, had also transferred to us all
its rights, amongst which was the sover-
eignty of Cambodia, which had existed
for centuries, expressly for the security of
the three provinces, and our interest as well
as our honor allowed of no violation. In
adapting this language Admiral Grandiere
had a double object in view, to put down
the ambition of the Court of Bangkok, and
to elevate tho King of Cambodia from his
state of subjection, and in inspiring him
with a desire of an intimate alliance with
France. In this his expectations were not
deceived.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As soon as the King of Cambodia know
of our friendly intentions, and that his in-
dependence had been assured, he sent the
Bishop of Cambodia, Mons. Miche to our
Gov. expressing his desire to confer with
him and hoping soon to see our flag floating
on the waters of Cambodia expelling piracy,
and sustaining his authority against the
incessant pressure under which he was held
by the Siamese and Annamites. Admiral
Grandiere hastened to Udong to receive
these overtures, and arrived there just as
an Anuamito Gen. had come to summons
the king to pay the usual tribute. This
circumstance made the King more anxious
to ally himself with the French, the nego-
tiations were not long, and by the aid of
M. Michie, the Admiral signed a convention
by which lie accepted the offers of the King
of Cambodia to place his kingdom under
the protectorate of France.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This act may become a source of grave
difficulties. But was it not necessary! Was
it not an inevitable consequence of our
position ? The brave Admiral who decided
to take the responsibility of the complica-
tions which might arise from this act, did
so because our uncontested ascendency in
Cambodia was a condition indispensible
for our establishment in Cochin China. It
was in fact an imporious necessity for us to
secure our new possessions on the North
with a sure ally, thereby freeing our milit-
ary forces and leaving them at our dispos-
al either to overlook other frontiers, or to
keep in order the Annamites who were
more warlike than submissive, and who
were always ready to dispute the conquer-
ed provinces.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Cambodia supplied us with 7 or 8000
bullocks for our troops, and from its great
lake the exportation of salted and dried
fish will be considerable, and when her re-
sources are developed it will be by her riv-
ers that the produce will feed the commerce
of Saigon. Had Admiral Grandiere hesit-
ated in securing these commercial advant-
ages, they would have been lost to us and
the commerce of our establishment would
have had to go by the canals of Ha-tien
and Bassai; this would have been the ruin
of our new possessions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When this negotiation was terminated it
raised on the part of the Government of
Siam the most lively complaints. The
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangkok,
wrote to Admiral Grandiere informing him
that the viceroy of Cambodia, although he
was sovereign of that country, was only a
functionary appointed by the Siamese Gov-
ernment, and that he was under constraint
when he signed the convention with the
Gov. of Saigon. The Siamese Minister ut-
tered loud complaints and expressed great
astonishment that no notice had been given
him of the intention of the French repre-
sentative to recognize the independence of
Cambodia, inasmuch as this proceeding was
contrary to the assurances given by the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of France to
the Siamese Ambassador, in words which
authorized him to consider that the boun-
daries of Lower Cochin China, and that of
the Kingdom of Siam, would be settled
direct with the Government of Bangkok.
Without entering into any explanation of
what had been done, our Government an-
swered, that notwithstanding their obliga-
tions to Siam, on the one hand, and to
France and the Court of Hue on the other,
the independence and autonomy of Cam-
bodia could not be legally contested, and
in consequence we had a right to treat with
that Power without consulting the Govern-
ment of Siam. And that with respect to
the constraint on the King of Cambodia,
Admiral Grandiere denies the assertion. In
the negotiation in which he was engaged
his honorable character, together with the
intervention of the Bishop of Cambodia,
are sufficient guarantees for the honesty of
that Convention. In the month of Nov.
1863 the minister of the Navy sent him reg-
ular powers, and special instructions from
the Minister of Foreign Affairs to make the
negotiation definitive with the King of
Cambodia, and in the mean time prepar-
atory to executing the treaty, a depot of
coal was made at Nam-Van, where the
four ways meet, at a commanding position
of the river and where the greatest traffic
exists.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This was not however enough, it became
necessary to take advantage of our novel
position. We had two ways of developing
the resources of this country, now become
French, by colonization and by a judicious
administration, those being both power-
ful and necessary.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}France is characterized by her adminis-
tration, she has a genius for conceiving and
organising, and carries with her a spirit of
order, content, and regularity, and proba-
bly in no time has this been more pro-
minent than in our establishment in Cochin
China. Our naval officers have most hon-
orably laid aside their military habits, and
taken civil duties upon them which circum-
stances required, following the example
given them by the Governor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prudence required the greatest manage-
ment, for to have made sudden changes,
although it were for the good of the inhab-
itants, would have been destructive to
our well being, and have made the natives
oppressed. The several Governors of
Saigon saw this and therefore adopted the
form of administration they found there,
they have not yet had any cause to change
their opinions respecting the customs of
the Annamites. The organization of Lower
Cochin China is in fact similar to that of
France, the frame work is nearly alike, and
the agency adopted, is similar to those func-
tionaries who fill corresponding employ-
ments there.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thanks to the experience gained it
Algiers, we have escaped another danger,
by having renounced the system of placing
all authority exclusively in French hands,
we have shared it with those who have
sincerely taken our part, and have chosen
many of the natives, thus the power of the
Governor commandant, instead of Viceroy,
is exercised by Annamite Administrators,
who have retained the titles and authority
which they held under the Government of
Tu-duc. They are still called phu and huyen,
and still continue to be judges, to collect
customs, and to maintain the public peace
in their divisions. They work under the
direction and control of the commandants
of Provinces. All officers of our army, ac-
cording to the extent of territory under
them, have the rank of Prefect or Sub-Pre-
fect. Those superior officers are assisted
by two Inspectors one having charge of
Native, the other of Foreign affairs. The
system that would have excluded public
functions from the natives, not only would
have been opposed by the population,
but would also have had the inconvenience
of having a large number of Europeans,
who had to act with promptitude, in a
country new and strange to them, having
the aid of interpreters and others, whose
assistance would annihilate their authority.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We wisely abstained from touching the
Annamite communities or their municipal
franchises, allowing them to carry out their
local interests, and raised them in their
own opinions, thus sparing them the humili-
ating thought of being under strangers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A modification however was made in a
law which existed before our occupation;
the Mayor was nominated by the director
of the Nation, approved of by the Governor
and presented by the Notables. He kept
under his control a list of the Notables,
which included the Registration of the pro-
prietors of the Parish who were subject to
the capitation tax. Those who were not
included, are exempt and pay in service.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This tax has now been made on individ-
uals according to the value of the land
cultivated, the number of soldiers re-
quired, and the services rendered, which is
fixed by the central authority, and the full
amount of the tax is guaranteed by each
Parish, who are responsible for all wrong
acts committed within their control. This
system which originates from those of the
Annamites, has the merit of lightening our
administration.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These considerate proceedings being car-
ried out with ability, and personal restraint,
we have succeeded in establishing the
French character among the Cochin Chi-
nese, and it is due to Admiral Gandiere
that these results have been obtained. One
of his first acts was to guarantee Annamite
freehold on the basis of French laws, this
measure gives the proprietor a security
which he had not before when he was only
tenant to the King. But judging from the
Dutch system in Java, and to avoid an-
other evil, the Admiral has reserved the
right of the natives to alienate their lands to
Europeans. This restriction is to prevent
the Annamites from being victims to spec-
ulating and unscrupulous strangers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To suppress piracy which is a profession
in Cochin China, the Admiral in conformity
to an Annamite law, has a general register
of the vessels including the names of all the
men afloat.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two acts, above all others, ought to give
the natives an idea of the superiority of
our civilization. The two vices which do
most mischief to the population, opium and
gambling, are under restrictions, but not
being able absolutely to prevent either
gambling or the traffic in opium, the Gov-
ernment of Saigon has termed them out
under severe restrictions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Admiral Gandiere has now made his
first budget, which is drawn up on the ba-
sis of those made by our other colonies, it
only shows the expenses of the local ad-
ministration, of the military service, and
of the Naval divisions remaining as a Col-
onial expense. We see with satisfaction
by this document that already the receipt
are equal to the expenditure, they amount
to three millions of francs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In rendering justice to the zeal and intel-
ligence of our administration, we neverthe-
less think that matters cannot remain long
as they are. It ought to give up the mil-
itary character and become civil. It is not
our wish to say that the Government of
French Cochin China should be confided
to a non military rule, for some time yet our
sovereignty ought to be in the hands of a
General officer, but it is not the same
with regard to the higher officers, we would
escape great embarrassments if we could
(like the Dutch at Java) govern our new
subjects by the aid of their chiefs, but un-
fortunately the Mandarins have remained
attached to the Government of Hue, and
identify themselves with its politics. All
that we could do we were unable to prevent
it. We must therefore replace these vacant
posts by persons attached to us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One system proposed which has the
merit of assimilating to the Annamite or-
ganisation, is to bring from France, active
and intelligent young men, to whom the
administration shall be open, after a time
and they having passed an examination
proving that they are capable of the duties
of Mandarins, they must have learned the
Annamite language, which is said to be
simple, and which may soon be learned af-
ter the Latin writing has replaced that of
the native.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Candidate will also have to study
judicial functions, and the Annamite Code
of Laws, which is written in the Chinese
character and is a constant study to the
learned and to the Mandarins, who in their
retreat from our troops carried them away
that they might not be contaminated. But
after have been found, and our Governors
are revising them, assimilating them in
their different parts, and they have been
printed in French at Saigon and in Chinese
at Canton, with explanations and coments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The introduction of civil officers in the
higher parts of the administration would
also have another advantage, which would
not but have a great political influence. If
we could efface from the population, the
remembrance of their being a conquered
people which they feel, we ought to
withdraw all signs of warfare and keep
our troops for the defence of the country
and prudently mix native soldiers for duties
in the interior. We desire to pursue a
conciliatory course, but notwithstanding
the severest discipline, the soldiers who
conquered the country, are considered by
the natives in a high position, they act as
masters and seldom mix with them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our religion may also attach to us the
Annamites who appear disposed (as it is
seen) to receive Christian doctrine, but
this duty ought to be confided to the most
prudent and pure.{{< /news/text >}}

Gambling Mania.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have not known a time when the
gambling mania was so rife among the na-
tives, and laborers so scarce as at present.
One would suppose that at a time like this
when there is no business doing, the rice
mills silent, and other places of employment
among the European community closed, that
laborers would be abundant. Such how-
ever does not appear to be the case. The
time was that when we needed a man for a
short time to go in the boat, or to do a
small job of work, we had but to send out
and call one; but now we most frequently
call in vain. Even a common cooly or
boatman who can at all be trusted can scar-
cely be had for any wages. When we come
to inquire the cause, the only one we can
discover is, that they have all become des-
perate and have taken to gambling. The
gambling establishment are all full to over-
flowing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Many of those who formerly appeared to
be steady quiet laborers have also been
carried into the vortex. There is a story
among them to the effect that some priest
of great wisdom, somewhere within the
limits of the city, has been fortunate en-
ough to discover a kind of oil, which if ap-
plied to the dice enables the player to see
the die before it is thrown, and that he is
now driving a good business by selling the
oil. We do not vouch for the truth of this
story, but give it as we got it. Could such
a discovery is made hence, the happy dis-
covery would be one a fairer way to wealth
than some of the oil speculators in the
United States. It is certain, however that thi
gambling mania has seldom been known
to prevail to such an alarming extent as at
present. The result is that vice of every
kind prevails in proportion. In this gam-
bling no one but the principle of the estab-
lshment makes anything, and those who
frequent such establishments soon find them-
selves hopelessly in debt. Thy must live by
some means, and the result is that they re-
sort to stealing. There have been more lit-
tle petty thefts around within the last few
months than we have seen in four years be-
fore. Some rather daring robberies have
been committed, and also attempts made
upon the life even of Europeans.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If this state of things is likely to contin-
ue It behooves foreigners to devise some
means of protection. The present system
of police whilst perhaps it is fulfilling all it
was intended to do by the native authorities,
is of little or no benefit to the foreign com-
munity. The Siamese government is, it is
true, owe foreigners protection, but it is
perhaps asking too much to request them
to establish a special police for the Euro-
pean quarter. The scattered situation too of
the foreign residences renders this course
the more difficult. Police arrangements too
are generally a municipal affair having lit-
tle or no connection with the general gov-
ernment. The municipal arrangements
here however amount to nothing and any
thing that is done must be done by the
government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It might be well therefore to call a meet-
Ing of the foreign community to take the
matter into consideration, and to devise
some effectual means of protection. Hav-
ing once decided what is best to be done,
we think the Siamese government would
willingly give any assistance necessary. At
the same time we think the government
should try to do something toward breaking
up those haunts of wickedness which are
the producers of thieves and robbers. From

{{< news/text >}}Gambling invariably leads to drunken-
ness, and theft, and the habit once acquired
it destroys every disposition for honest la-
bor. By thus encouraging idleness and
vice this people are nurturing an enemy
within, far more dangerous than any they
have yet had to fear from without. In
Pennsylvania and some other parts of the
United States, if a person is found with-
out any visible means of obtaining a liveli-
hood he is brought before a magistrate and
made to give an account of himself, and if
he fails to do this he is taken care of by
the authorities. If some such proceedings
were instituted by the Siamese, and all
those lazy worthless fellows who do nothing
but frequent gambling establishments, were
compelled to go and work in the new canal
or some other public work, it would be ben-
eficial to the country, and the life and
property of all would be much more
secure. {{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Since the above has been in type we
learn upon good authority, that His Ma-
jesty has determined to establish a separate
Police force on the New Road.{{< /news/text >}}

A TOUR TO THE HOT SPRINGS
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would appear that there are only two
Hot springs in Siam known to Europeans. 
One of them is on the eastern side of the
Gulf of Siam, about 12 miles S. E. from
Anghin, the other on the western side of
the Gulf about 45 miles from the city of Pet-
chaburee. It is a tour to the latter made
in the month of March 1865 of which I
purpose to give some account in this and
subsequent numbers of this Journal.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our party was composed of two Euro-
pean merchants, our American merchant,
and two American missionaries. As the
place could not be reached or even ap-
proached by any river or canal, which are
the common channels of communication in
Siam, we had to plan for an "Overland"
route, and being quite an uncommon pro-
cedure for this country, was all the more
exciting both in the anticipation and realiz-
ation. And as our destination was to a
place in the parched and "howling wilder-
ness" far away from all human habitations, it
became necessary to provide food and drink
for a three day's journey, as well as some
other comforts for an encampment in the
woods at least for two nights. To this end we
hired two ox carts and filled them quite full of
supplies for the singular Expedition, and
sent them off at 2 o'clock P. M. twelve
hours before the time of our starting, charg-
ing the steward and teamsters to be sure
of reaching a certain place 20 miles distant
in time to have our breakfast ready on our
arrival thither the next morning at 8 o'clock.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We provided ourselves with each a fine
pony from the excellent livery stable of the
Deputy Governor Pra-Palat, who, though
at the time absent on a visit to Bangkok,
did not fail to leave matters so that all our
wants should be promptly supplied. We
had a Siamese guide mounted on a beast so
small that some of us gifted with uncom-
monly long legs, would have had to flex
them to a right angle to clear the ground,
and would have tried to walk with one foot
and ride with the other. The creature
was so emaciated that it seemed prepos-
terous to think of making him perform the
journey, especially as a leader. His endur-
ance was marvellous. We had also con-
nected with us a hostler general to take
the entire charge of the horses whenever we
should stop. He rode a respectable pony.{{< /news/text >}}

<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}Leaving our lodgings at Petchaburee at
3 o'clock A. M. by a charming moonlight,
we rode up the king's high-way to the foot
of Palace Mount. Then passing a little
way to the right, close to its northern base,
we took a north westerly direction by foot
paths over sea-level fields from which pad-
dy had been cut two months before, beau-
tifully studded with palmyra trees, stand-
ing in mild majesty and charming disorder
all over them to the number of at least six
to every square acre. It was quite enchant-
ing to ride among them in the magnificent
moonlight. Every ten or fifteen rods our
ponies had to leap or stumble over a little
embankment made for confining the water
at certain seasons in the plats for the benefit
of the growing rice.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first village of any consequence that
we came to was ———— about 5 miles from
P, occupied exclusively by Laos. Here the
Chief of the tribe resides, and in his house
the Prot. Missionaries of Petchaburee oc-
casionally hold meetings on moon light
evenings. The next place of importance
was also a Laos village about 8 miles dis-
tant called Hooah-tap'an. Here was a
temple which the king sometimes honors
by personal visitations when occupying his
mountain palace. A little beyond this place
the charming palmyra groves nearly all left
us, and we had to traverse a vast tract of the
openest land, with scarcely a tree to be
seen upon it. After this we entered upon
a tract of slightly elevated country, it be-
ing a gentle acclivity towards dark moun-
tains far ahead. This was studded with
clumps of the slender bamboo, then leafless
in their fall season, and a few other leafless
trees and shrubs, together with here and
there a tree yet clad in its green livery to
break pleasantly the monotony of an ap-
parently winter forest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Presently our road became gravelly and
then stony, bearing many marks of having
been underlaid by an eruption from a vol-
canic crater. Anon we came into mountain
gorges, going up hill and down hill, and
into deep ravines, and along almost impas-
sible ruts made by water in the wet season
rushing along the cart tracks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing these, we came into a forest of
the Resin tree which seems to be quite ex-
elusive in its occupancy. The trees are
mostly small, the larger ones having been
culled out for house-posts. This forest re-
minded us strongly of the shrub oak woods
we had been accustomed to in our boyhood.
There was scarcely any under brush among
them, and very few leaves on the ground,
although the trees had been stripped of all
their foliage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is from this Mei-teng-rang tree, as it
is called, that the Resin of Siam is pro-
cured. It exudes in a plastic state from
cracks and crevices on the body and limbs
of the tree, and then, becoming dry and
brittle, hangs pendent like isicles from the
places of their origin. It is because these
trees are so thoroughly imbued with this
resinous substance that house-posts made
of them are in the greatest repute. The
hearts of them are almost literally indestruc-
tible by simply water and air whether out or
in the ground.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the Mei-teng-range woods we came
into another tract of the slender bamboos
beautifully arranged in clumps of a hundred
or more trees each, within a circumference
of twelve feet, being on an average twenty
feet high, with open and clean spaces be-
tween the clumps. Even the leafless clus-
tres were charming to behold. How much
more so when in full foliage!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing this tract, we were next intro-
duced into dense forests of lofty timber the
beginning of the “howling wilderness,” The
Merchants had their guns along, and were
prepared, as they thought, for the pleasure
of hunting wild fowl, peacocks, deer, and
even leopards and tigers. They had great
pleasure in the preparation and anticipation
but scarcely none in the realization. Their
guns, being suspended on their backs, were
found to be cumbrous and almost intolerably
burdensome appendages on horse back. We
heard squirrels and peacocks in the night
time, but could not see them. After day-
break a wild fowl crossed our path and one of
the gentlemen dismounted to hunt for it,
but it was not to be found. A quadruped
of somewhat fearful dimensions was seen to
run into the thicket, and the man a head
cried out A leopard! a leopard! which
quite startled those of us in the rear. But
it proved to be only a deer. No shot could
be got at her as our hunters were too slow
for her fleetness. An innocent and frolic-
some monkey tempted our marksmen to try
their skill at a shot; but its face looked so
much like a human being, they thought it
best to let the creature prolong its life un-
harmed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From our first setting out, the guide gave
us the names of four principal places as way-
reliefs to our breakfasting station, supposed
to be about equally distant from each other.
These were Hooa-Tap'an, Hooa-na, P'oot-
t'a-kop and Ta-kraw. The first was nam-
ed in passing. The second was at the head
of the paddy-fields and hence its name.
This we reached a little before day break and
then merged into the woods. The third
we made at 7 o'clock and found it only a
sala in a small opening in the wilderness.
The fourth was the twenty mile station at
which it was appointed that we should
breakfast and rest untill the evening-cool
of the day. This we reached at 7¾. glad
enough to dismount and find small ponds of
cold water in the channel of a rivulet nearly
dry, in which we could bathe. It was a dense
forest of the loftiest trees.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Here we found our two ox carts together
with their six or eight attendant servants.
Our commissary had been there barely long
enough to begin his arrangements for our
breakfast. A dish of pork and potatoes
was presently cooked, a "few small fishes"
broiled, rice boiled, currie made, tea and
coffee etc. prepared, enough to begin with.
Then spreading a clean cream colored mat
on the ground, we ordered this extempor-
ized table to be loaded with the bounties
of God, which the two carts had brought
for us, and then sitting down Turk fashion
on the borders of it, and craving a blessing
from our heavenly Father, we began our
repast. The breakfast was doubly relished
for its coming to us after a ride of 20 miles,
served in woods composed of primitive trees
magnificent in height, with monkeys for
spectators, and birds of unaccustomed plu-
mage and note to sing us their morning dit-
ties. Would that I could transcribe their
songs. The notes of some of them were
something like kooawoo-attawoo, some
kooakoo kooahoo some koowara hoowara,
others kooppapook, and one sang hippoo-
hill hippoohill, reminding us most pleasant-
ly of boyhood days, when we had heard
in our own father-woodlands the never-to-
be-forgotten notes, whippoor-will glass me
honey.{{< /news/text >}}

Duplicity
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Kite, who had kept sailing in the air
for many days near a dove cote, made 
a stoop at several Pigeons, but all to no
purpose, (for they were too nimble for 
him,) at last he had resource to stratagem and 
took his opportunity one day, to make a 
declaration to them, in which he set forth 
his own just and good intentions, who had 
nothing more at heart, than the defence 
and protection of the Pigeons in their an- 
chent rights and liberties, and how concern- 
ed he was at their fears and jealousies of
a foreign invasion; especially their unjust 
and unreasonable suspicions of himself, as
if lie intended, by force of arms, to break 
in upon their constitution, and erect a 
tyrannical government over them. To pre- 
vent all this, and thoroughly to quiet their 
minds, he thought proper to propose to them 
such terms of alliance and articles of peace 
as might for ever cement a good understand- 
ing betwixt them; the principal of which 
was, that they should accept of him for 
their king, and invest him with all kingly 
privilege and prerogative over them. The 
poor simple Pigeons consented; the Kite
took the coronation oath after a very solemn 
manner, on his part, and the doves the 
oaths of allegiance and fidelity on theirs. 
But much time had not passed over their 
heads, before the good Kite pretended that 
it was part of his prerogative to devour a 
Pigeon whenever he pleased. And this, 
he was now contended to do himself only, 
but instructed the rest of the royal family 
in the same kingly art of government. The 
Pigeons, reduced to this miserable condi- 
tion, said one to the other, Ah! we deserv- 
ed no better! Why did we let him come in? {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Debts of the States.-—The following 
are the debts of several of the principal 
States of the Union, according to the last
official reports:-—New York, $28,720,724 ;
Pennsylvania, $39,379,003 ; Massachusetts,

{{< news/text >}}A Handsome Gift.-—The gift of $51,

Farragut has been completed, by placing the
bonds in his hands, and transmitting to him

white and red.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}An English Gun.-—The Armstrong
gun which was captured at Fort Fisher was
one which was presented by the manufact-
urer, Sir William Armstrong, to Jeff. Davis.
A soldier, describing it, says it "is, by all
odds, the handsomest gun I ever saw, being
entirely of twist wrought iron, and mounted
on a magnificent solid mahogany carriage."
It will be sent to West Point as a trophy.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}"Come and See Me"—Never take
"come and see me" as a phrase meant in
earnest, unless it is accompanied with a
date. An invitation without "circum-
stance" is no invitation at all. Depend
upon it, if any gentleman or lady desire
your company, he or she will appoint a
time for your visit. "Call on me when you
can make it convenient," "drop in as you
are passing," make us a visit whenever you
have a hour or two to spare," are social
indefinitisms by which men of the world
understand that they are not expected to
do the things requested. When people
wish to be cheaply polite, there is nothing
like this kind of vagueness. The com-
plimentary small change of society should
always be taken at a large discount. It is
never worth its face, or anything like it.
Yet it is a convenient medium of exchange
for all that, and heavy debts of gratitude
that ought to be repaid in better coin, are
often paid with it. People who have more
polish than principle use it lavishly—plain,
blunt, honest men, sparingly, or not at all.
Whoever makes a friendly visit to a fash-
ionable house on the strength of such a
"Come and see me," will be likely enough
to find that the family circle which he has
dropped into by request is as ungenial as
the arctic circle, and to leave it with a
chilly feeling about the heart that will
prevent him from venturing into the same
high latitude thereafter. But when a
whole souled fellow, whom you know to be
your friend, grasps you vigorously by the
hand and says: "Come and dine with me
to-day—dinner on the table at 5 o'clock
—be sure to come, we shall expect you"
—go if you can, and you will be all the
better for it, both in mind and body. One
likes to meet friends at the hospitable
board—one's own or their's, it matters not
which—but a nod in the street is all
sufficient from a fashionable acquaintance.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}A letter from Saigon of Jan. 12th, in the
Patrie, says:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The position of the settlement in Low-
er Cochin China is excellent. The year
which has just come to a close is the first
that has given to the colony twelve months
of uninterrupted tranquility. This inter-
val has not failed to be turned to good ac-
count. The maritime arsenal of Saigon has
been constructed, and a repairing dock
made in the interior of the port. Besides
this, the artillery service and that of the
bridges and roads have given rise to im-
portant works. Twenty primary schools have
been founded for the purpose of teaching
the Annamite children the use of the Ro-
man letters. In three months 600 children
have learnt to read, and 300 to write. In
addition, a directory of the interior has
been created, and civil tribunals have been
inaugurated in the colony, which follow the
practice of the Code Napoleon, in civil and
commercial procedures, and criminal and
penal prosecution. Rear-Admiral de la Gran-
diere's departure for France is fixed for the
5th of March. He is to return to Saigon
in the month of July or August next. Dur-
ing his stay in Paris he will communicate
to the Government very useful and correct
information on the situation of Cochln Chi-
na."{{< /news/text >}}

ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE LAND.—-
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A writer for a Boston paper, who has visited
the great falls on the Snake river, the south-
ern fork of the Oregon, says: "The dis-
tance the whole volume of water falls in
one sheet is 200 feet. Above there is about
25 to 30 feet fall before it reaches the grand
fall. The width of the grand fall I should
judge to be about 2500 feet. I have visited
the Niagara many times, but this fall eclipses
it far. Four miles further above we found
another one of less note, where the water
divides into two parts, and falls a distance
of 167 feet. When the Pacific railroad is
completed this will become as fashionable
a visiting place as Niagara is now, with,
however, a wider range of curiosities to at-
tract the attention of visitors."{{< /news/text >}}

Privy Council, and which raised an im-
portant question as to the liability of the
owners of cargo to contribute for salvage
services in the saving of the lives of pas-
sengers. The Court of Admiralty had de-
creed £2,200 as salvage. It was alleged
that passengers were not cargo, and did not
come within the Act of Parliament. Lord
Chelmsford pronounced the judgment of
their lordships. It was an important ques-
tion whether passengers were to be includ-
ed, and also whether the owners of cargo
were to contribute in the payment of the
sum awarded. Their lordships were of
opinion that on both grounds the Act in-
tended that passengers were included, and
the owners of a cargo liable. The appeal
would therefore be dismissed with costs.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The weather for the last fortnight has
been the most promising. Rain has fallen
abundantly in delightful showers. The
whole vegetable and animal creation has
awoke to a vigorous life. Rice producers
are full of hope and on the alert to get
ready for the planting. And Merchants
and all classes dependant on rice, are now
looking a hundred per cent more cheerful
than three weeks since.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The late visit to this city of TAN-KIM-
CHING, whom His Supreme Majesty had,
two or three years since, made Siamese Con-
sul in Singapore, appears to have been very
honorable to himself, as it was most agree-
ble to the King and his princes and nobles.
The title conferred upon him by His Majes-
ty is Prà-Pee t’ate-Panit-Siyam-P’ee-chit-
Pàkdee. He was honored by having several
audiences with His Majesty, and special in-
vitations to the residences of most of the no-
bility and Chinese merchants of Bangkok,
and was feasted sumptuously in many
places.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The greatest parade made for him appears
to have been at the palace of His Excellency
Chow Phya Prà K'lang, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, and at the new and spacious man-
sion of Prà P'asée Sómbàt-Bawrìboon. At
both these places the feasting was conducted
partly in the style of European princes and
lords, and partly in the style of Chinese
rulers. We have good authority for say-
ing, that there were on each festival occas-
ion more than one hundred different dishes
served, not including the sweatmeats and
fruits, which where full seventy in kind.
When the guests had eaten at one table to a
degree of satisfaction, they arose from it
and engaged in chit chat, tea drinking, and
tobacco smoking, while the dishes were all
being removed to give place to others equally
numerous. When all things were ready they
were seated at the second table. Having
feasted a while they again arose to chat, to
drink, to smoke, and wait for the third table.
Thus did they feast and enjoy themselves
from the edge of the evening until 1 o'clock
in the morning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Excellency the P'râ kl'áng had the
Lion of the day honored, by the playing of
his fine band of native musicians, on "the
cornet, flute, harp, sackbat, psaltery, dulci-
mer and all kinds of music" indescribable.
And P'râ-pasée-Sômbât graced his festival
with Chinese music and theatrical perform-
ances.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Excellency, Chow Plya Sri Suri-
wôngs gave Pr'n-P'ee-tate-P'anit, the oc-
cupancy of his delightful garden palace, all
the time of his stay in the city, and had a
body of servants constantly devoted to the
care of supplying all his daily wants in re-
gard to board and lodging, and a fine boat
well manned placed at his command to con-
vey him wherever he wished to go.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We were glad to learn that the Consul
for Siam, in Singapore, had been thus hon-
ored.{{< /news/text >}}
