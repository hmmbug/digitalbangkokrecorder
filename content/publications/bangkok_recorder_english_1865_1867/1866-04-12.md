Seizure of another coolie
ship.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Hongkong, a Bordeaux coolie
ship, left Whampoa for Havanna a
few days ago, and has been seized by
the emigrants. The incidents of the
Pride of the Ganges case, seem to
have been closely imitated. The Cap-
tain has been murdered, and seven of
the crew are still in the hands of the
Chinese. The news of the seizure
was brought to the French consulate
yesterday, by the French vice consul
of Macao, to which port ten men of
the Hongkong's crew, who succeeded
in making their escape, proceeded in
one of the ship's boats. They arrived
at two o'clock on Thursday afternoon,
and reported the details of the mutiny.
The ship left the river a few days
ago with 260 coolies on board, under
the command of Captain DUVAL. Al-
though nothing occurred which raised
any suspicion of the intention of the
emigrants, they suddenly rose on the
afternoon of Wednesday. The Cap-
tain was killed at once by a blow with
a hatchet, and the crew fled for pro-
tection to the cabin where they de-
fended themselves as long as their
ammunition lasted. At last the Chin-
ese by pretending to surrender, induc-
ed them to come out of their retreat.
The coolies profited by this opportu-
nity to possess themselves of weapons,
and the fight continued. Seeing that
they were overpowered, those of the
crew, who were able, succeeded in
launching one of the boats and escap-
ed. The seven others who were all
more or less wounded, remain in the
hands of the Chinese. Amongst them
are the first and second mates.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Governor of Macao, to whom
the French vice-consul at once appli-
ed, had no gun-boat at his disposal to
send in search of the mutineers, but
promised to furnish military assistance
if a steamer could be obtained by
other means. This however could
not be done, and yesterday morning
the vice-consul came over in the
White Cloud, and laid the whole case
before M. du CUESNZ. He of course
immediately visited Admiral KING,
and obtained a promise that a gun-
boat should be dispatched as soon as
possible in pursuit of the captured
ship.-—O. Trade Report Mar. 1st.{{< /news/text >}}

Railway for Manila.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whether we shall ever have Rail-
ways in China is a problem to be sol-
ved by time. The "farthest East"
is not, however, to be left entirely
without this great result of Western
civilisation. We are to have a Rail-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}way in Manila. The services of an
English Engineer have been engaged
and he is now prosecuting his surveys.
The local government are rendering
every assistance and support, and it
is hoped that in about three months
time, all plans, specifications, statistics,
concessions, &c., will be prepared.
The line is to run Eastward from
Manila to the Pacific, but the con-
struction will be divided into short
stages, with a view of testing the
profitable nature of the undertaking;
a fresh issue of shares being made
for every stage or division. The first
stage will extend from Manila to Ta-
gig, a port on the lake of Bay, at pre-
sent the anchorage of the Cascos from
all parts of the Province, and when
cargoes are shipped into canoes for
Manila. It is estimated that this stage
will pay well, indeed there is no rea-
son to doubt the soundness, practica-
bility, and commercial safety of the
whole scheme, but the first stage will
probably be found the most profitable.
As it is proposed to also a limited
number of shares for absorption in
China we have been at some pains to
ascertain the general grounds upon
which the speculation has been intr[o]-
duced and upon which the hopes of
its successful issues are founded, and,
without committing ourselves to any
recommendation on the subject, we
will place before our readers the re-
sult of those enquiries. It is simply
that we have been convinced of two
important facts: viz., that the inter-
ior of the island is productive to an
almost unlimited degree, and that the
means of transport are utterly inade-
quate to its requirements.—Over.

The Cruise of the "Opossum."
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The recent cruise of the Opossum
has been attended with very brilliant 
results. Lieut. St. John, her com-
mander, has in one week, captured 
sixteen junks, forty prisoners, fifty 
three guns, has burnt a private village, 
and liberated twenty seven captives,—
a week's work to be proud of, indeed. 
Our readers will remember that a few
days ago we reported the arrival of 
the Opossum at Macao with the infor-
mation that she had destroyed fifteen 
junks. Since then we have learned 
some particulars of her adventures.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Saturday the 10th, Lieut. St. 
John applied for leave, and received 
permission from the Admiral to go 
out for a cruise. He did not at that 
time know of any projected operations 
on the part of the pirates, and intend-
ed simply to look round and see what 
was going on. His fires were no soon-
er up, however, than scme of the na-
tive merchants sent off to inform him 
that a number of pirate junks were 
lving at a place called Pak-shui, on 
the west coast, a little beyond Масaо.
In that direction therefore he steered, 
and yesterday werk flushed the birds 
he was in search of. At the head of 
a small creek stood the village guard-
ed by a battery of three guns,—one 
of them a 55 cwt-gun throwing a 24 
th. shot,—and anchored off it, lay the 
piratical junks, fifteen in number. 
They were all armed, some of them 
heavily. In all they carried forty-
three guns, most of them 18-pounders.
They were manned by 200 men, and 
it must be acknowledged were not a 
bad match for one bost with only 
three guns on board, manned by about 
seventeen or eighteen Europeans, even 
though these were British seamen. 
Lieut. St. John came in, so that as he 
ran down on the junks they were end 
on to him, and their guns being all in 
the broadside, were consequently use-
lass. As soon as he came within range, 
he opened a flank fire on the battery, 
and in a very short time, its defenders 
cleared out This was the signal for 
the men in the junks to do the same. 
The whole two hundred scrambled on 
shore, and made off into the interior, 
leaving the vessels a prey to the gun-
boat. Lient. St. Jons landed with a 
small party of men from the gun-boat, 
and while he was on shore, as we un-
derstand, the explosion took place on 
board one of the junks by which the 
warrant officer of the Opossum was 
wounded. He was engaged setting 
fire to the vessel when a jar of powd-
er standing on the deck took fire. 
There was no explosion in the ordin-
ary sense of the word. That is no 
materials were thrown about, but the{{< /news/text >}}

<!-- Article: 1866-04-12_1_7 text -->
<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}gunner was burnt by flame of the
powder, and by a succession of small-
er explosions which followed. A boy
who was with him jumped over-
board and escaped with but few in-
juries, but the gunner could not swim
and had to run on in the junk. A
marine was wounded in another ex-
plosion while setting fire to a junk
which had been hauled upon shore.
After the work had been performed,
when the pirates were all out of the
way, and the Opossum was busily en-
gaged destroying their craft, a fleet of
forty Mandarin junks came round the
point. It seemed that the Imperial
men-of-war had been twice beaten off
by the pirates of Pak-shui, and were
coming down this time in force. The
one English gunboat however had ac-
complished the task out of hand, and
there was nothing left for the Chinese
but to profit by the victory. They
landed 1600 men and burnt the vil-
lage, and Lieut. St. John handed over
to them the greater number of the
captured junks and guns after having
destroyed the rest. He then went to
Macao, and sent back his wounded
men to Hongkong. During the whole
of Monday he remained at Macao, but
Tuesday morning saw him down the
west coast again. On Wednesday off
a place called I-mum he fell in with a
large heavily armed junk, about thirty
feet longer than the Opossum, carry-
ing eight guns (one 50 cwt. one 30
cwt. and the others 12 pounders), big
enough to have hoisted Her Majesty's
small ship Opossum on board alto-
gether if she had the proper machin-
ery. This junk was at once recog-
nised as the vessel of which the gun-
boat, on information received, was in
search. When she was stopped, her
owner was prepared with all the docu-
ments necessary to prove him, a most
respectable trader, only carrying guns
for his own protection, but it happen-
ed that Lieut. St. John had on board
the Chinaman, who really owned the
vessel. She had, it seems, been en-
trusted to the man now found in pos-
session of her, who had never after-
wards accounted for her to his owner,
but had turned pirate instead. When
confronted with the Chinese merchant
on board the Opossum, he saw that
his game had been "played out," and
resigned himself to his fate with Asia-
tic fortitude. He made no further
attempts to defend himself either by
arguments or physical force, and to-
gether with forty companions was
conducted by the Opossum to Quang-
hai and given over to the Mandarins.
By then, he was recognised as a man
of great influence on the west coast.
He and his crew will be sent on to
Canton, and there is no reason to
doubt the fate that awaits them. The
captives we spoke of above were re-
leased at Pak shui before the village
was burnt.—O. T. Report Mar. 1st,{{< /news/text >}}

Bible Readers.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}I, for one love the Bible supremely.
In all the world, I have found no book
to set beside it. Other books I love
well. Milton, Taylor, Carlyle, Ten-
nyson, Emerson, Spencer and many a
noble names beside in this great bro-
therhood, is so dear to me that there
are few sacrifices I could not gladly
make rather than lose their compan-
ionship. But when I am in any strait
—-when I want to find words other
than my own to rebuke some crying
sin, to stay some desperate sinner, to
whisper to the soul at the parting of
the worlds; to read, as I sit by them
that weep beside their dust, words that
I know will go to the right place as
surely as corn dropped into good soil
on a gleaming May day—-then I put
aside all books but one—-the book out
of which my mother read to me, and
over which she sang to me, as far back
as I can remember. And it is like those
springs that never give out in the
dryest, and never froze in the hard-
est weather, because they reach so
directly into the great warm fountain
hidden under the surface—-it never
fails me. But have we not all noticed
the curious fact that men go to the
Bible for what they want to find, ra-
ther than for what they ought to find?
that those who profess the most obso-
lute submission to its authority offer
generally the finest proper illustration
of the supremacy of the soul over
the Bible in the way they contrive to
make it serve their turn? and that it
is by no means impossible to find a du-
plicate of the good Scotch woman's
minister, of whom she said, "If there
is a cross text in the Bible, he is sure
to find it and take it for a sermon!"
The truth is, the Bible is like a great
pasture into which you turn all man-
ner of feeders. The horse takes what
he wants; so does the cow. The
sheep is true to its instinct; so is the
goat. And then, last of all, the ass
rolls the thistle, like a sweet morsel,
under his tongue. So, when a man
with a large, sweet nature comes to
the Bible, he crops by a sure instinct
all the large, sweet passages. The
hopeful man finds the hopeful things;
the sad man the sorrowful things; the
hard man the gritty things; and every
man the things that satisfy his crav-
ings, though they may in no way
make for his peace.—Rev. Robert
Collyer.{{< /news/text >}}

Cowardice of Opiates.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}I implore you, do not try morphine
ever; no, not once. I will trust you
not to do so not to take any opiate
whatever. I ask it humbly. Pledge
me your word that you will honorably
comply with this, in the letter and in
the spirit too. It is a wicked and
cowardly attempt to rule the spirit by
the flesh. It is beneath you. If you
do it I can honor you no longer: the
results upon the system are slow, sure
and irreparable, and the habit grows
until it is unconquerable. I am deeply,
anxiously in earnest. You are not
worthy the fidelity of my friend-ship if
you try to drown misery in that way.
Except in the grossness of the effect,
where is the difference between the
opiate and the dram! Do you not
know what keeps the gin palaces
open? Misery! The miserable go
there to forget. You must not, and
shall not do it, for it is degradation.
I would have you condescend to no
miserable materialism to escape your
sorrow. Remember what Maria Theresa
said when she began to doze in dying.
“I want to meet my God awake.”
Remember that He refused the medi-
cated opiate at the cross. Meet mis-
ery awake. May I borrow sacred
words: “Having begun in the spirit,
do not be made perfect through the
flesh.” Summon the force to bear out
of your own heart, and the divine that
dwells there-—not out of a laudanum
bottle. I have spoken ruggedly but
not rudely. Forgive me; I am myself
to-night: I would gladly sus-
tain the depression I feel by opiate, or
by anything else; but I resist, because
it is despicable.—-Rev. F. W. Rob-
ertson.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Read Aloud.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Reading aloud is one of those exer-
cises that combine, mental and mus-
cular effort, and hence has a double
advantage. To read aloud well, a per-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}son should not only understand the
subject, but should hear his own
voice, and feel within him that every
syllable was distinctly enunciated.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Reading aloud helps to develop the
lungs just as singing does, if properly
performed. The effect is to induce
the drawing of a long breath every
once in a while, oftener and deeper
than that of reading without enunciat-
ing. These deep inhalations never
fail to develop the capacity of the
lungs in direct proportion to their
practice.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Common consumption begins uni-
formly with imperfect, insufficient
breathing; it is the characteristic of
the disease that the breath becomes
shorter and shorter through weary
months, down to the close of life, and
whatever counteracts the short breath-
ing, whatever promotes deeper inspi-
rations is curative to that extent,
inevitably and under all circumstances.
Let any person make the experiment
by reading this page aloud, and in
less than three minutes the instinct of
a long breath will show itself. This
reading aloud developes a weak voice
and makes it sonorous. It has great
efficiency, also in making the tones
clear and distinct, freeing them from
that annoying hoarseness which the
unaccustomed reader exhibits before
he has gone over half a page; when
he has to stop and clear away, to the
confusion of himself as much as that
of the subject.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This loud reading when properly
done, has a great agency in inducing
vocal power, on the same principle
that muscles are strengthened by ex-
ercise—those of voice making organs
being no exception to the general rule.
Hence in many cases, absolute silence
diminishes the vocal power, just as
the protracted non-use of the arm of
the Hindoo devotee at length paralyzes
it forever. The general plan in ap-
propriate cases is to read aloud in
a conversational tone, thrice a day, for
a minute or two, or three at a time,
increasing a minute every other day,
until half an hour is thus spent at a
time, thrice a day, which is to be con-
tinued until the desired object is ac-
complished. Managed thus there is
safety and efficiency as a uniform re-
sult.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As a means then, of health, of
averting consumption, of being social
and entertaining in any company, as a
means of showing the quality of the
mind, let reading aloud be considered
an accomplishment far more indispen-
sable than that of smattering French, or
lisping Italian, or dancing cotillions.{{< /news/text >}}

True Power.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is a truly noble sway of man
over man; one which it is our honor
to seek and exert; which is earned by
well doing; which is the chief recom-
pence of virtue. We refer to the quick-
ening influence of a good and great
mind over other minds, by which it
brings them into sympathy with itself.
Far from condemning this, we are anx-
ious to hold it forth as the purest glory
which virtuous ambition can propose.
—The power of awakening, enlighten-
ing, elevating our fellow-creatures
may, with peculiar fitness, be called
divine; for there is no agency of God
so beneficent and sublime as that
which He exerts on rational natures,
and by which he assimilates them to
Himself. This sway over other souls
is the surest test of greatness. We ad-
mire, indeed, the energy which subdues
the material creation or developes the
physical resources of a state. But it
is a nobler might which calls forth the
intellectual and moral resources of a
people, which communicates new im-
pulses to society, throws into circula-
tion new and stirring thoughts, gives
the mind new consciousness of its fac-
ulty, and rouses and fortifies the will
to an unconquerable purpose of well-
doing. This spiritual power is worth
all other. To improve man's outward
condition is a secondary agency, and is
chiefly important as it gives the means
of inward growth.—The most glorious
minister of God on earth is he who
speaks with a life-giving energy to
other minds, breathing into them the
love of truth and virtue, and strength-
ening them to suffer in a good cause,
and lifting them above the sense of
the world.—-Channing{{< /news/text >}}

Songkran Holidays.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}This is the 2nd day of the Siamese
Sóngk'ran holidays. The term began
as we are informed according to His
Majesty's astrological calculation a
few minutes after one o'clock on Tues-
day night, and is to continue for a
period of about 100 hours, that is to
say until 5 o'clock and a few minutes
on Sunday morning the 15th inst.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These holiday seasons commence
precisely at the moment when the sun
enters the zodiacal sign —— termed
in the Bali Soorǎ estimate which al-
ways occurs about the 12th of April.
The Siamese civil years uniformly
begins at this time, and being direct-
ed by the sun may be called their so-
lar year. But they have also a year
governed only by the moon and hence
is their lunar year. This, very oddly,
always commences at the beginning of
their 5th month. These two seasons
of New-year are universally observed
by the Siamese as holidays. The so-
lar New-year is regarded with more
reverence and religious ceremony than
the lunar New-year but both are large-
ly devoted to visiting, sporting and
gambling. And as they occur always
near together, never more than a
month apart, and sometimes not more
than 15 days, they are exceedingly
annoying to business men from abroad,
who are anxious to press forward
their work in hand, but cannot, because
of the obstinate determination of their
Siamese employees to spend the great-
er part of the three days of the for-
mer, and four days of the latter, in
play.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The calculations for the beginning
of the Sóngkran or Solar New-year
festival are usually made out in readi-
ness for publication on the day of the
great congregation to renew the oath
of allegiance —- which is the 3rd day of
the 5th month. The king always in-
vites to his palace a large company of
Buddhist priests for a royal festival
on the occasion for four successive
days. Princes, nobles, lords, and
people of the more affluent classes
very generally have special religious
services at their own houses, feast the
priests and one another, and play at
their games of chance much as on the
lunar New-year holidays. The women
draw water and bathe the idols, the
persons of the priests, the elders of
the people, their grandparents, and
other aged relatives. They do these
things thinking to call down blessings
upon those for whose benefit they
profess to perform them; but more
especially upon themselves and their
families by way of recompense—a car-
dinal idea in their system of self-right-
eousness.{{< /news/text >}}

Apparent.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty the king of Siam re-
turned from Petchaburee on the 8th
inst. The royal brass band was on
board the royal yacht steamer that
bore His Majesty up the river and
played charmingly while he passed
from the lower end of town to the
royal palace, a distance of more than
two miles. As we listened to the
sweet harmony of the spirit stirring
music we could but say within oursel-
ves.—Now this is an exhibition of
Young Siam. How much is she begin-
ning to look and behave like Europ-
ean nations! And if she go on in the
way of improvements in which she
has entered, another fifteen years as
since she took it at the beginning of
the present reign, and be not only
undisturbed by foreign powers, but
powerfully aided, as she has been, by
freedom of intercourse with them, will
she not prove herself worthy of the age
in which she lives, and deserve high
encomiums from the most enlightened
nations! Our feelings towards Siam
as she now is and what she promises
to be, harmonize in the main with
those expressed by one of our corres-
pondents in another column of this
issue. Never before has she had an
heir-apparent of so much promise at
the age of 14 years as now in the
person of Somdetoh Chowfa-Choola-
lon-korn. And if his life be spared
(which may Almighty God grant) and
his education be continued increasing
in thoroughness as he has begun, sus-
tained by the presence and power of
his worthy sire, we think he will be-
come an illustrious prince, and a most
worthy heir to the throne of the Pra-
báts raised to new life and glory. Our
eyes and our hearts fix upon him as
the next king of Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Though the sons of other Siamese
princes, nobles, and lords are far from
being what we could wish them to be,
yet they are far ahead of what their
fathers were at their age. We regard
them, on the whole, as being a very
promising generation, and such as
should inspire lively hope, and not
fear, that they will put their shoulders
to the wheel of progress and carry
Siam steadily forward in her march
of improvement.{{< /news/text >}}

Our Papers.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We had brought before as yesterday
day a very singular proof that our
Siamese semi—monthly paper is doing
positive good by its faithful reporting
of evil doers. The Siamese govern-
ment sent us for tangible evidence of
this fact two muskets, two swords, a
lot of gold, a piece of white crape, and
some other articles which had been
rescued from the hands of highway
robbers on the canal leading from this
city to Maháchai. In one of our
Siamese issues more than a month
since, we reported a gang of robbers
in that region, giving the names of
many of them. The verbal message
brought us yesterday from the govern-
ment was, that she wished us to know
that she was on the alert and deter-
mined to have justice done to all work-
of iniquity and that the most of that
band of robbers had been taken and
imprisoned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This simplicity and condescension
of government to cheer us on our way
was indeed very gratifying. And yet
it is passing strange that the same gov-
ernment seems to be condemning our
papers for their constant influence as
is said, in stirring up some public ex-
citement with which the king is trou-
bled, and many of the chief princes
and rulers in Bangkok with him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We do not at all wonder that they
are greatly disturbed by the frequent
revelations of corruption that our pa-
pers are making; and it pains us ex-
ceedingly to do this work. But like
faithful surgeons who see no other
way to cure than to lance a spreading
abscess, and bring out the corruption,
and no way to save the body but to
amputate a mortified limb, so we feel
that we must take the course we do
so long as we occupy an editorial
chair.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The government appear to be
frightened at the revelations we are
making, thinking that she will get the
name of being the most corrupted in
the world. But it is time that she
had learned the lesson that the only
way to cure this corruption is to ex-
pose it to light, and that the light that
exposes it should not be blamed, but
the men that produce it.{{< /news/text >}}

Correspondence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
For the "Bangkok Recorder"
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}MR. EDITOR;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"An article which appeared in the
Singapore Daily Times, of the 28th
ulto. from a correspondent in Siam
though it have the appearance of con-
veying a good deal of truth, has cer-
tainly some things in it quite open
to criticism. To say nothing of the
troubles in the outer provinces of Siam
of which the writer speaks, I think the
remarks concerning Young Siam
quite too sweeping; and I cannot
think the author has critically watch-
ed her manly growth or he would
never have made the blunder, in say-
ing that there are none being trained
to fill the places of her presunt rulers.
Is it to be supposed that a Monarch
whose kingdom has made such pro-
gress in the arts and sciences as his
has done under the liberal policy of
free trade, free speech, free press,
free schools, free religion, free con-
science, free every thing that does
not interfere directly with his gov-
ernment is to take no interest in,
and make no provision for its per-
manency and future welfare? Let
that brilliant company of young prin-
ces and princesses, sons and daughters
of His Majesty the supreme king,
more than thirty in number with the
heir apparent a remarkably clever
lad of 14 years at their head, all
training under his own eye, in his
own palace by the best European
teacher His Majesty is able to secure,
answer; And they can do it with a
flourish of the pen that would put
many of us to the blush. And what
of the other princes-—brothers, ne-
phews, and cousins of His Majesty?
Ask that middle aged portly Prince
who is peering into every nook and
corner that he may get a little light
to shine upon his sons and daughters.
See him stepping into your parlor
with his great atlas under his arm,
school boy like, asking for a minute
knowledge of the physical world.
How long before the sons of such a
prince will see to it that there be a
geography translated into their own
language? And what shall be said of
His Majesty's Prime Ministers-—the
one for the Southern division of Siam
the other for the Northern? —Prime
as these men are, and worthy of their
titles is it to be dreamed, even, that
they have no sons in their large fami-
lies of blooming youth under training
to fill their places that time must ere-
long vacate? It is a whole sale slan-
der to name the thing, and preposter-
ous even to dream of it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Who but with lively sympathy and
high regard, can behold Siam's Mon-
arch a man of superior talents, with
an insatiable thirst for knowledge,
with an indomitable will for improve-
ment, and a soul sufficiently expansive
to place his people in the full enjoy-
ment of the blessings of the most en-
lightened nations; but seeing it yet
impracticable, he carries Old Siam in
his benevolence, and presses forward
Young Siam if possible to keep pace
with the high pressure of enlightened
Christendom urging him onward and
upward in his desires and purposes.
He has not only put into offices of
trust generally the best and most en-
lightened men his kingdom could pro-
duce, but he has also sought out and
selected many helpers from among
his European and American friends.
And in making these selections there
seems to have been a remarkable
cleverness and soundness of wisdom
in avoiding national partialities, and
keeping up a kind of balancing power
among them. One of them trains his
soldiers, with his accompanying brass
band. Another is Captain in the Royal
navy. Another is Commissioner of
the Police Force. Another is Har-
bor Master and Master Attendant.
Another is teacher of His Majesty's
numerous and most promising family.
Others are preparing books for him on
the arts and sciences, literature and reli-
gion, and another is foreman in the
Royal Printing Office &c. These
several aids of which His Majesty has
availed himself are so distributed
among the different nationalities as
that in fact none has greatly, if at all
the preminence, although from a curso-
ry glance some might think otherwise.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nothing has been said of the schools
in operation for the common classes
and the powerful though silent influ-
ence they are exerting on Siam's fu-
ture well being. Let us then give
His Majesty our full confidence and
earnest prayers that his precious life
may be prolonged, until he see the
full accomplishment of his best wishes
for the good of his people, and not
burden him unnecessarily with our
doubts and criticisms. We are prone
to err greatly in the exercise of an
impatient spirit touching the progress
Young Siam is making in her ad-
vances towards the higher civilization
of European nations. In our ardor
we would have her rush on to perfec-
tion with a velocity a hundred fold
greater than our world's history has
ever known.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}SIR:—The kingdom of Siam has
been brought into considerable notice
during the last few years, but the va-
rious publications relating to the
country give very little idea of the
government except in general terms,
and nothing whatever so far as it re-
lates to her numerous provinces. In
your last issue you refer to the esta-
blishment of telegraphs and railways
through the country, (which heaven
grant may be speedily consummated)
but the peculiar relations of the pro-
vinces to the central government are
said to be such that it is doubtful
whether the Court of Bangkok can
authorize such works without first
consulting those provinces on the
subject. This leads to the inquiry,
how many provinces has Siam, and
what are their relations to the central
government ? Any information you
can give on this subject, will confer a
public good.{{< /news/text >}}

LOCAL,
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our contemporary the London &
China Express informs us, that Mr.
T. W. Smith (Nuk Prat of Bangkok
notoriety, or perhaps better known as
the Reporter to the Siam Times) has
arrived in London from Shanghai
bringing home a Chinese dwarf (the
same that was exhibited here) aged
about 35, and said to be the son of
the Pilot who conducted the English
fleet into Chusan, and who was dwarf-
ed by the Chinese authorities as a
punishment for the sin of his father.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are informed that at a recent
meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society,
Dr. A. Bastian read a paper in eluci-
dation of a number of Indo-Chinese
alphabets, collected by him during his
sojourn in Burmah, Siam, Cambodia
and other parts of Transgangystic
India.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some curious facts were stated,
bearing on the history of these alpha-
bets, and among others, that in the
oldest Siamese stone inscriptions, that
of Sukkhothay, all the vowels are
written in a line with the consonants,
instead of (at least some of them) being
placed above or below the line.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}A "hard case" has been brought
to our notice in regard to a seaman
lately discharged from the Siamese
ship Conqueror. Our readers will
remember that this vessel was attack-
ed by Pirates and that, after a noble
resistance, the marauders were finally
beaten off. During the affray the
best part of the crew betook them-
selves to such parts of the craft as
appeared to them the most safe, while
the unfortunate fellow of whom we
write was one of those who defended
the vessel and received a wound in the
action. On being paid off, the sum of
$10 odd were due to him, which
amount was handed to the Doctor
for medical attendance upon the
wound received while defending the
owner's property!!! Can such injus-
tice stimulate future crews similarly
situated. ?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are remarkably few fires oc-
curring in this dry season in Bangkok.
It is, perhaps, attributable to more
vigilance of government this year than
formerly. We noticed that in the
dry season of last year there was a
marked improvement in this respect
over the year previous. We have
heard of no conflagrations of any note
from the 6th of last month to the
6th inst. On that day there was a
small fire broke out on the opposite
side of the river from our office, and
burned three houses near the palace of
His Royal Highness Krom Mua
Oodom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We learn from reliable authority
that a messenger has quite recently
arrived from Choong Mai from whom
the Siamese government has learned
that while the Chief of Choong Mai
had in a panic done many things that
were wrong, there seems to be no evi-
dence that he has ever had any
thought of going over to the Burmese
for protection. The prospects of war
in that quarter appear hence to have
happily blown over.{{< /news/text >}}

til H. S. M's. gunboat "Impregnable"
shall sail for Singapore on the 18th

{{< news/text >}}He is now, by the politeness of H.

European Powers have been making
for several years past.{{< /news/text >}}

of the magnificent dock establishment
"Stabitiments Ticnico Triestno" have

matter, and the enlightened master of
Commerce, Baron V. W"allerstoff

interest, so that the embassy to the

{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have been informed that a
Prussian gentleman, a stranger in the
country, having but lately arrived from
China, was rather rudely treated last
evening by a band of Siamese in the
front of the Royal palace. Report says
that he rode a pony up to the lower
guard station, and seeing a wide open-
ing to the beautiful lawn in front of the
royal palace, and no sign of a living
guard, or even a gun, or any thing else
intimate to him that he must not ride
his pony upon the ground, and no
one having informed him that there
was any such limitation to his riding,
rode in and through nearly to the pa-
lace of the 2nd king, and then turned
back. But before he got back to the
gate, the guard rushed out and arrested
him, and talked loudly to him in Siam-
ese. He being an utter stranger in Siam
could not of course make out what they
wanted of him, and found himself in a
complete fix. They however, to
make a short work of it, lead him and
his pony across the lawn to the rear of
the residence of Mr. Leomones, and
signified to him in some way that he
must leave his pony and saddle and
bridle with them and make his
way home on his own legs as best he
could. Finding no one to help him
out of his dilemma he walked home and
reported the matter to the Prussian
consul. We are not informed of the
result.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now we have not the least fault to
find with the law against riding in
front of the royal palace nor against
the good regulations that have been
established for the purpose of having
that law carried into effect. But we
do think that there was in this instance
a very inexcusable slackness of the
guard at the gate, and that they and
not the Prussian gentleman ought to
be made to suffer for it ; and then
made to understand that one of them
at least must always be standing at
the gate as men in such stations always
do in Europe. We are informed that
it is rare to find any one standing at
all in the attitude of a sentinel, but
generally all lying down. Now we
hold that this is not only dishonorable
to His Majesty, the porch of whose
palace they are appointed to guard
but unfaithful to the foreign commu-
nity especially strangers riding for
pleasure, whom their standing with
gun in hand is supposed to warn away
from the premises without the ne-
cessity of a word spoken.{{< /news/text >}}

George Stephenson.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from No. 13.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Years went on, and the locomotive
was dragging the coal waggons on the
tram-road at Killingworth, without
any one thinking of the possibility of
such a plan being adopted of dragging
passenger carriages. The common peo-
ple called the engine Puffing Billy,
and after a little time curiosity ceased
about the matter, until a gentleman of
property, named James, discovered
—-not the locomotive, but George
Stephenson, and had the wisdom to
see that he had made a great discovery.
This gentleman thought of railways
and steam travelling as possible, and
in 1818 submitted a plan to public
investigation. Another powerful friend
rose at this time, Edward Pease, an
eminent Quaker, graphically described
by one who knew him as " a man
who could see a hundred years ahead!"
This worthy gentleman, aided by
others of his persuasion—-Richardsons,
Backhouses, &c., formed the first rail-
way company, and the first line of rail
laid down, was form Wilton Colliery,
near Darlington, to Stockton, and was
called in the district "the Quakers'
line." The best works the old Ro-
mans left were their wars, and the re-
suits of those wars are like a tedious
fable. We in this age may well look
on the first railway with interest, for
when the record of our warriors and
our victories shall have dwindled into
insignificance, these railways will tell
to coming generations of the stout
hearts, strong hands, and wise heads
of the nineteenth century.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There was, of course, plenty of
laughter about the railways; people
used the word "ridiculous;" some
noblemen would not have their fox
covers disturbed; others ordered their
people to drive off any person making
surveys, as trespassers, or summarily
to duck them in a neighbouring horse-
pond; and pamphlets were written to
alarm the public. It was gravely stated,
that if railways were formed, it would
prevent the cows from grazing, hens
from laying, and that the poisoned air
from the locomotives would kill the
birds as they flew, and render the
preserving of game impossible. While
householders near the line were told
their houses would be burnt up, vege-
tation destroyed, innkeepers ruined,
and passengers massacred. And when
it was known that Mr. Stephenson
had said travelers could journey at a
speed of twelve miles an hour, there
was one shout of laughter throughout
the kingdom. But truth, though of-
ten impeded, is never overcome. Ste-
phenson and his band of faithful friends
and scientific allies bore the brant of
this ridicule.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}No trial that the great engineer ever
endured, equalled his examination be-
fore a committee of the House of
Commons, in March, 1825. He was
then forty-four years old, a well-
built man with a comely, intelligent
face, and mild, prepossessing manners.
But his speech retained a touch of
his native dialect, and his ideas were
swifter and far more powerful than
the words that he found to express
them. So that confused by many
questions, and conscious that he was
looked upon doubtingly, he was em-
barrassed and did not do himself jus-
tice. He wished, as he said, for any
hole to creep out of, and would rather
have done the very hardest work than
have stood before that committee, one
of whom asked " if he was a foreig-
ner?" another said, " he was mad,
and one put this case for his consider-
ation, " suppose one of these engines
to be going along a railroad at the rate
of nine or ten miles an hour, and sup-
pose a cow were to stray upon the
line, would not that, think you, be a
very awkward circumstance?" "Yes,"
said Stephenson drily "Very awkward
indeed" for the cow." The laugh on
this occasion was not against the wit-
ness, who sadly perplexed as he was,
resolved not to be put down, and ulti-
mately the bill was obtained for the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That line runs for twelve miles over
a bog called Chat's Moss. There never
was such a triumph of road-making
as carrying a line over that dreadful
swamp. It occupied many months,
and cost a vast sum of money, but
the road was at length safe and good,
and it remains the best part of the
line. *From this time the fame of the
great engineer was established-—his
fortune made.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Besides his labours as railway engi-
neer, Stephenson is beloved in the
north of England for his valuable in-
vention of a safety lamp called a
"Geordie," and without taking from
the great name and merits of Sir
Humphrey Davy, whose invention is
equally original and efficacious; the
Geordie Lamp was in the hands of the
manufacturer on the 24th of Novem-
ber, 1815 he had been completing it
from August of that year, and it was
not until after the lamp had been
brought into use in the pit on Decem-
ber the 3rd, that Stephenton heard of
a safety lamp in the course of con-
struction by the above-named great
chymist.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To trace the progress of the great
engineer's success, would be to write
the history of railroads in Britain.
The high level bridge, Newcastle; the
tubular bridge, Menai Straits, are
some of the greatest works of fa-
ther and son, while the Kilsby Tun-
nel, in the excavating of which, the
men came upon a quicksand, that then
had to pump dry by the labour of 13
engines, 200 horses, 1250 men,
night and day for eight months, rais-
ing 1800 gallons a minute, seems a
labour and expense almost incredible.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was a fine quality in Mr. Ste-
phenson's character, that he liked to
aid talent in others. Many young men
looked up to him as a father. He
promoted their interests, and aided
them by his wise advice. He often
bore testimony to the power of per-
severance, by relating passages in his
own life, at the mechanics' and Liter-
ary institutions in the north, or near
Tapton Hall, his country seat, in Der-
byshire, and once, when a Secretary
asked how he should announce his
name—-What were his ornamental
initials? he said " I have no flourishes
to my name either before or after, and
I think it best you merely say, George
Stephenson. It is true I am a Belgian
Knight; but I do not wish to have any
use made of it." Thus simple, modest,
unassuming in his wealthy days as he
had been industrious and kindly in his
struggling years; he passed on to a
genial old age, surrounded by faithful
friends, comforted by an affectionate
wife; whom, many years after the
wife of his youth had passed away,
he had sought as the companion of
his declining years, and blessed by the
dutiful attentions of his congenial-
minded child, his son went peacefully
down, in the sure and certain hope of
a brighter rising to an endless day.
After a short illness, he died, of ef-
fusion of blood from the lungs, August
the 12th, 1848, aged 67.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In all the relationships of life-—as
son, husband, father, servant, master,
and friend, George Stephenson is a
most noble model of a true hearted
man His biographer does not tell
us of his spiritual or inner life ; but
such kindness and goodness do not
spring from unaided human nature,
and doubtless he could say, " it is by
God's grace I am what I am."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The Mexican Question.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Parisian Correspondent for the Penang
Argus Jan. 8th 1866. Says:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among the questions the first and
most important is that touching the
occupation of Mexico by the French
troops, and the future relations of
France with the United States. The
paragraphs in which the Emperor al-
luded to this delicate question are ex-
tremely unsatisfactory to all parties.
They contain nothing but the reitera-
tion of a vague promise made last year,
which, in point of fact, amounts to
nothing at all. The Emperor was
well aware that he was not in a position
to say anything definite upon this sub-
ject, and would perhaps have passed
it over in silence, had it not been
necessary to disarm the opposition,
and if possible prevent them from ac-
cusing him of not fulfilling the promises
made to them in the last session. The
great mass of the people in this coun-
try are strongly opposed to the oc-
cupation of Mexico, and all those also
know the exact value to be placed
upon the Emperor's words, are griev-
ously disappointed, for they look into
the future, and see no tangible hope of
escape from the difficulties into which
the Emperor's dangerous and foolish
policy must inevitably lead us. Apro-
pos of Mexico you will remember that
the Emperor Maximilian before start-
ing for his new empire placed the
Chateau of Merimar at the disposal of
the Austrian Imperial family. We
now learn that the Archduke, Charles
Louis, second son of the Emperor of
Austria and his family arrived at the
castle on the 10th, with the intention
of spending some time there. Query,
—Are they warming the house for
Maximilian?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The diplomatic documents relating
to this question, have been laid by
President Johnson before Congress.
The notes exchanged between the
French government and that of the
United States occupy just now the
attention of all American, English and
French newspapers. It is now manifest
that notwithstanding the tranquility
and confidence afforded by the French
government, the United States, though
having but just brought the civil war
to a termination, declared that it would
never recognize the Emperor Maxim-
ilian. The President is desirous of
remaining on good terms with France,
but this desire will not induce him to
sacrifice the Monroe doctrine:-—He
has ever regarded the government of
Mexico as any other than that of a
republic, and when he speaks of Max-
imilian he terms him the Archduke
of Austria, styling himself Emperor of
Mexico. He complains bitterly of
foreign intervention in the internal af-
fairs of an American people, at all times
the ally and friend of the United States,
and he omits no opportunity of enu-
merating all the acts of cruelty, per-
petrated by Maximilian’s lieutenants,
against the Mexican officers taken
with arms in hands defending their
country and lawful government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The institution of Peonage in Me-
xico, which is nothing else but disguis-
ed slavery, excites also bitter recrim-
inations. An intercepted letter from
Capt. Maury, has been published,
which is very compromising for the
Emperor Napoleon, who is represented
as personally interested in this work
of Mexican emigration, which is nothing
else than a means offered to the slave
holders of the South, to escape from
the domination of the North, and
to avoid the abolition of slavery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The attitude of the French govern-
ment in this correspondence is suf-
ficiently humiliating. It is evident
that it comprehends the impossibility
of any longer carrying on an enter-
prise, which became impossible the
moment that the North had trium-
phed over the South.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nevertheless it endeavoured to dis-
guise from itself the necessity of yield-
ing to the injunction of the govern-
ment of Washington without at the
same time, daring to openly declare
itself the protector of Maximilian. It
seems probable, that the French gov-
ernment has decided on its future line
of conduct, and that not being able to
overcome the obstinacy of the North,
it has made up its mind to with-
draw its troops.—-This is at least what we
are given to hope from the Imperial
discourse on the 22nd instant, and
there are more than one reason for
supposing, that this time the promise
will not be a falsehood, or intended
only to keep the opposition in good
humour. *{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is generally believed that the
Emperor occupies himself a great deal
not only with the internal policy of
the country, but also in foreign affairs,
and that his ministers are nothing
more than his chief clerks. This was
true for many years, but in these last
eighteen months the Emperor has com-
pletely changed, in constitution he has
become an old man, and his only de-
sire now is to enjoy life tranquilly and
die in peace; he always goes to bed
before midnight, rises every morning
at five o'clock, and spends his morning
hours in writing the “Life of Julius
Cæsar.” In point of fact he has now
what may be called, a from hand to
mouth policy, and keeps constantly in
his mind the passage from scripture.
“Sufficient for the day is the evil there-
of.” Sometimes he takes whims and
starts, such, for instance as the evac-
uation of Rome, at other times he adopts
despotic measures, an example of which
we have in his speech of to day. There
is however one part of the Emperor’s
character which always affords him a
support on which he can rely and that
is his belief in his lucky star. That
star he says has never deceived him,
and will continue to guide him as the
star in the east, did the Magi of old.
The people however do not possess the
same confidence in the Emperor’s
lucky star, as you will see from the
following curious cabalistic calculation
which is now being circulated in pri-
vate, of course this is done with the
utmost secrecy. Louis Philippe came
to the throne in 1830, and was obliged
to fly in 1848. Napoleon III was de-
clared Emperor in 1852, and it is
predicted that he will fall in 1869.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The Emperor was strongly attached
to Mr. Cobden, and at one time Mr
Bright held a prominent place in his
esteem. The semi-official journals had
orders to seek every opportunity of
praising him: but the turn of events
are now making in England and the
power Mr. Bright is acquiring with
Lord Russel has somewhat alarmed
the Emperor, for he feels certain, and
certain it would be, that should Mr.
Bright's liberal mênsores succeed in
England, a revolution in France would
inevitably follow. In my present let-
ter the political element has gained the
ascendency, but to day the atmosphere
of Paris is overcharged with politics
and their influence is the more keenly
felt as we have just emerged from that
state of political torpor, which always
precedes the opening of the session
But I will now change the subject.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Situation of France with
America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It cannot be concealed that "the
situation," as our neighbours might
phrase it, is an awkward one, and can
easily be converted into a dangerous
one. On the one hand, France has
committed herself to an enterprise
which was certainly ultra vires; and,
on the other, America takes her
stand on a doctrine which, as her
politicians now interpret it, is unten-
able. Neither of the Powers can boast
of an unassailable position; but both
are determined, at almost any sacrifice
of sentiment, to avoid war. There is,
however, this material difference in the
relative chances of the two Govern-
ments—that of the United States is
backed by the public opinion, perhaps,
it would be more correct to say, the
popular passion, of the community,
while that of France is condemned by
its own subjects.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Under such circumstances, it is not
likely that diplomatic differences will
be widened into an international rup-
ture. Some compromise which will
save appearances on both sides will be
earnestly searched for, and, we will
hope, be ultimately discovered. The
danger is that, while things remain in
their present state of entanglement,
rash and irresponsible zealots may
succeed in rousing the pride or kin-
dling the resentment of one or the other
of the principals in the dispute, and a
collision may become inevitable. We
trust that Napoleon's good fortune will
rescue him from any such calamitous
result. But we fear there remains but
small chance that his grand experiment
will illustrate by its final result the
sagacity of his statesmanship. Time
and events will be far more likely to
prove that Imperialism is a plant which
cannot be acclimatised in the northern
continent of America; that it demands
for its development a far different pol-
itical atmosphere; and that, after all,
the Latin races will do wisely to ac-
cept their "manifest destiny," and not
seek for themselves a troublous and
uncertain one on the other side of the
Atlantic. For ourselves, we should
not have been sorry to witness the
realisation of the "Napoleonic idea;"
but unless we misread the signs of the
times, Dis aliter visum, an it is use-
less to war against Nature.{{< /news/text >}}

Luther and Calvin as
Students.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Luther, when studying, always had
his dog lying at his feet, a dog which
he had brought from Wartburg, and
of which he was very fond. An ivory
crucifix stood at the table before him,
and the walls of his study were stuck
around with caricatures of the pope.
He worked at his desk for days toge-
ther without going out; but when
fatigued, took his guitar with him in-
to the porch, and there executed some
musical fantasy. (for he was a skill-
ful musician,) when the ideas would flow
upon him fresh as flowers after a sum-
mer's rain. Music was his invariable
solace at such times. He was accus-
tomed to say that after theology
music was the first of arts. Next to
music, if not before it, Luther loved
children and flowers. That great
gnarled man had a heart as tender as
a woman's.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Calvin studied in his bed. Every
morning at five or six o'clock, he had
books, manuscripts and papers carried
to him there; and had he occasion to
go out, on his return be undressed and
went to bed again to continue his
studies. In his later years, he dictated
his writings to his secretaries; He
rarely corrected anything. The sen-
tences issued complete from his mouth.
If he felt the facility of composition
leaving him, he forthwith quitted his
bed, gave up writing and composition
and went about his out-door duties
for days, weeks and mouths together.
But when he felt the inspiration fall
upon him again, he went to bed, and
his secretaries set to work forthwith.{{< /news/text >}}

Hurrah.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The exclamation of "Hurrah!"
which is so powerfully sounded through
the air wherever bravery, courageous
audacity and energy are intended to
be praised, is a Slavonic term, mean-
ing in English, "to the Paradise!"
The origin of the word is derived
from the primeval idea that every
man that dies as a hero for his country
will forthwith be transferred to heaven.
During the heat of fighting and the
struggle of a battle, the combatants
will sing out this call with the same
religious feelings as the Turks cry
their "Allah." The "Hurrah" will
fill every warrior with enthusiasm,
inspiring him with the hope of ins-
tantly receiving the heavenly reward
for his bravery. Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

Gibbon's Confession.

{{< news/text >}}The celebrated Gibbon confessed
just before his death, that when he
considered all worldly things, they

they had been fleeting; when he look-

to be an infidel for the comfort of it.{{< /news/text >}}

Education and Longevity.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A writer in the Atlantic Monthly
proves by statistics that man's longev-
ity is in exact proportion to his edu-
cational attainments, provided his
health has not been injured by over
mental exertion. It seems that in-
creasing intelligence and decreasing
war have prolonged the average length
of life in Europe from twenty-five
years in the seventeenth century to
thirty-five in the eighteenth, and to
forty-five in the nineteenth. The best
educated communities are the longest
lived, and the best educated soldiers
live amazingly longer than the mere
ignorant, and seem to wear a charmed
life, not so much against bullet and
bayonet, as against the effect of dis-
ease, privation and even severe wounds,
on their constitutions and lives.{{< /news/text >}}

Young Ladies.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A cotemporary discourses in this
wise: "The number of idle, useless
girls, in all our large cities, seems to
be steadily increasing. They lounge
or sleep through their mornings and
parade the streets during the afternoon,
and assemble in frivolous companies of
their own and the other sex to pass a
way their evenings. What a store of
unhappiness for themselves and others
are they laying up for coming time,
when real-duties and high responsibil-
ities shall be thoughtlessly assumed!
They are skilled in no domestic duties
—nay, they despise them, have no hab-
its of industry nor taste for the use-
ful. What will they be as wives and
mothers? Alas, for the husbands and
children, and also for themselves!—
Who can wonder if domestic unhappi-
ness and domestic ruin follow?"{{< /news/text >}}

The Widow's Mite
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Covetous people often seek to shel-
ter themselves behind the widows mite
and to give a paltry sum to benevolent
objects, under cover of her contribu-
tion. The follow'ng incident has a moral
for all such:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A gentleman called upon a wealthy
friend for contribution.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Yes, I suppose I must give you my
mite," said the rich man.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"You mean the widow's mite, I sup-
pose," replied the other.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"To be sure I do."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The gentleman continued.—-"I will
be satisfied with half as much as she
gave. How much are you worth?"
"Seventy thousand dollars," he an-
swered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Give me then a check for thirty-
five thousand; that will be just half as
much as the widow gave, for she gave
all she had."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was a new idea to the wealthy
man.{{< /news/text >}}
