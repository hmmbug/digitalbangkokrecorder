From our own Correspondent.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/right >}}
Paris, 10th May 1866.
{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}To the Editor of the "Bangkok Recorder"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir:—-The papers tell us that the
famous sculptor Schlesinger has just
terminated an immense statue repres-
enting universal peace, which is to be
placed in the great international Ex-
hibition. It seems to us that the time
is ill chosen for such a monument.
One of the witty papers says apropos
of Schlesinger's work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Le sculpteur propose
Bismarck dispose.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The latest telegrams bring us the
news of new armaments; every body
however is begging some body else to
disarm. Austria begs Prussia to disarm,
and the consequence of the request is
that Bismarck orders 5000 of the Land-
wehr to keep a sharp look out on the
Saxon frontier.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Austrian general Benedik has
taken the command of the troops in
Bohemia, and Prince Albrecht is in
Verona and the Quadrilateral is being
literally choked with cannon. The
Italian peninsula resembles one great
camp, and from the straits of Messina
to the Alps we hear but one cry;—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}War to the Knife.—-Garibaldi
has left Caprera. The Venetian chambers
have authorized Victor Emmanuel to
take dictatorial power, and volunteers
are swarming from all parts to enlist.
Prince Napoleon is at Florence, and
now there appears no doubt but that
a secret treaty really exists between
Italy and Prussia.—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How cannot is be otherwise, for how
could Italy whose coffers are quite
empty be making such military pre-
parations, unless somebody were be-
hind the scenes with a bag full of
money? However, this can hardly lead
us to believe in the new firm of,—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Bismarck, Garibaldi and Co.—-
Interest makes strange bedfellows.—
Bismarck the representative pour Ex-
cellence of despotism in partnership
with Victor Emmanuel the represen-
tative of the principles of nationalities.
Austria which sold the duchy of
Lauenbourg holding Venetia with an
iron hand, and mocked at Prussia for
wishing to swallow the Elbe duchies
without asking the inhabitants to
what sauce they would prefer being
eaten; it is indeed—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}(A TERRIBLE MESS,)—which has
been lasting for more than a month,
with telegrams and diplomatic mes-
sages flying about Europe, but as yet
not a shot has been fired; however no
body dare lead off the dance without
the consent of the master of the Tui-
leries, who has all along remained
mum. The corps Legislatif met on Thur-
sday last and it was impossible for
Monsieur Rouher the Minister of
State to shirk the question of 'what
are you going to do?' The declarations
of Mons: Rouher were of a most
pacific nature. The policy of France,
he says, will for the present be one of
complete neutrality, and opposed to
any attack directly or indirectly on the
part of Italy against Austria. Should
Victor Emmanuel take so inconsider-
ate a step, it must be at his own risk.
The Emperor retains perfect freedom
of action. Everybody seemed satis-
fied at the intention of the government,
and Monsieur Thiers gave us a long
regmarole (with false dates, talking of
the conduct of Nelson in 1807, three
years after the death of the Hero of
Trafalgar ) advocating peace `a tout
prix. It was thought that we were all
right and were beginning to laugh at
our ridiculous fears when a killing frost
came and nipped our hopes in the
bud. The Emperor and Empress
went the day before yesterday to open
the agricultural show at Auxerre and
in a speech, in answer to an address
from the Mayor, said that he breath-
ed more freely amongst the inhabitants
of the Department of the Yonne for he
was well convinced that their attach-
ment to his house were unalloyed, and
that they like himself detested the
treaties of 1815.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The telegraphic wires brought us
the pendant of{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
L’ Empire cest la paix
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In no time, and its effect was like a
clap of thunder. Prussia again went
down with a run and Emile de Girar-
din says in an article in the “Liberti”
the speech of Auxerre is the first note
of the tune to which we shall have to
dance in Europe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Every succeeding German paper
brings us most uncomforting news.
There is marching and counter-march-
ing in Prussia, Saxony, Austria, Bav-
aria, and Wartemberg, and even Russia
it is said is again at work at—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
THE FORTIFICATION OF SEBASTAPOOL.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The knowing ones maintain that
Napoleon will remain a quiet looker
on, if war breaks out, but I differ with
them. He is evidently on very good
terms with the cunning Bismarck and
the adventurous Victor Emmanuel
—-Bismarck’s journey to Biarritz some
time ago was not for the health of the
Prussian Premier: something has been
brewing for some time past. Bis-
marck would like to have the duchies,
and Napoleon would not refuse to ex-
tend his frontiers a little further, if
you don’t object, say as far as the
Rhine,-—well perhaps something might
be done.—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is evident that Napoleon the
Third who never gives up an idea,
will again propose his hobby horse,—-
THE CONGRESS.-—As he will inform
Messrs. Hohenzollern and Hapsburg that
he cannot stand such turbulent neigh-
bors, and must try if they will come
to Paris and settle their little differ-
ences. The French capital is a nice
place, and there is enough to amuse
them. Who will think of refusing so
polite an invitation!—-surely neither
Prussia nor Italy as they are on too
good terms with the Tuileries, and
Austria dare not.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are moreover other matters to
settle. The question of Molds-—Wal-
lachia, which has at last found a so-
vereign in Prince Karl von Hohenzol-
lern. Venetia and Rome which is a-
waiting the putting into execution of
the 15th Sept. convention.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What an excellent opportunity of
leaving young Maximilian in the lurch !
England which a year ago turned a
deaf ear to the proposed Congress,
now seems to think the idea not so bad.
This is what the Sphinx of the
Tuileries is driving at—-tear to pieces
the Treaty of Vienna—-be proclaimed
THE PACIFIER OF EUROPE.—-And in-
vite the representatives of the leading
nations to come and spend a few days,
and have a look at the great ex-
hibition of 1867.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THIS A CONSUMMATION DEVOUTLY
TO BE WISHED.—The people of Paris
feel rather dissatisfied at the speech of
the Emperor at Auxerre, for it must be
concluded that the air of the capital
does not agree with him as he breathes
so much more freely out of it. Napo-
leon the III has not forgotten the in-
gratitude of the good people of his
capital, who have returned nothing
but anti-Napoleonic members.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF COUNT
BISMARCK.—Assassination seems to be
the order of the day, and it may truly
be said “ Uneasy sits the head that
wears a crown.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Berlin dispatches inform us that an
attempt similar to that on the life of
the Czar of Russia, was made on count
Bismarck the day before yesterday. On
his way home a madman of the name
of Bind, a son of the famous democrat
fired five pistol shots upon the premier,
—who fortunately escaped unhurt. The
would be murderer committed suicide
by cutting his throat with a sharp in-
strument.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}DUELLING IN THE HOLY CITY.—
The anti-christian and abominable
practice of genteel murder called duel-
ling is decidedly on the increase. We
have this winter had several rencon-
tres in Paris and that on the most
fatile grounds, private correspondence
from Rome inform us, that the duel
between Count Reciarde and Marquis
Corta continues to be the subject of
conversation. The Pope has ordered
that both shall be punished according to
law. The papal major domain has been
named judge on the case. Count Re-
ciarde has given himself up. The se-
conds will also be arrested, young
Baron Hubner has made himself scarce
under pretence of joining his regi-
ment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Monde Muniple writes that the
autograph score of Mozarts Zauberflöte
(the enchanted flute) has been pur-
chased for £40 by the banker Jaqués
of Berlin, who has made a present of
it to the Koniglich Bibliothek for which
the Adler Orden has been conferred
upon him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The series of balls at the Tuileries
have now closed, so there will be no
more dancing this season. These enter-
tainments have been most numerously
attended by citizens of the U. S. of
America.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE SISTER OF RACHEL AND THE
OYSTER BED.—Shortly after the death
of her sister the celebrated Trogi-
dienne Rachel, Mdlle. Sarah Félix
abandoned the stage, and took to oy-
ster breeding on the shores of lower
Normandy, where she has for some years
past sucessfully directed an extensive
parc aux huîtres. However the oyster
pest by which the Caneal districts has
been attacked has so depopulated her
bed that she is now forced to make
fresh exertions to obtain a livelihood.
She has fortunately obtained permis-
sion to cultivate a fresh bed on which
she intends to try and acclimatise the
gigantic American horse-shoe-oyster,
a delicacy unknown to the European
cooks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Dion Boucicault's lastest produc-
tion, is shortly to be put on the stage
in Paris: the frequenters of our theatres
will be enabled to see an English
court of justice represented to the life,
wigs, gowns and all.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Patti the delightful Italiano-Ameri-
can songstress has left us: she will
shortly appear in London. There is no
truth in the report that she was short-
ly to give her hand and heart to a Ger-
man prince now in Paris.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the midst of this continental
confusion it is some consolation to
look at the example given us by Eng-
land, instead of me killing with the con-
cerns of her neighbours, Great Britain
is looking at home. What should we
say in France if we could show a
surplus equal to that of our neighbours
across the channel.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hear that the surplus will be
devoted to pay off the national powers
which are allowing their funds to be
swallowed up in keeping up immense
standing armies, in reducing the taxes,
every year. The friends of enlargement of
the franchise in our country were sur-
prised that the ministry got so small
a majority as five, and we expected
to hear of the resignation of the min-
istry, but we were agreeably disappoint-
ed. The poor Molda—Wallachians are
still in hot water in their newly elect-
ed Hospodar. Prince Karl of Hohenz-
ollern has been rejected by the confer-
ence of Paris. Russia is trying her hand
again, and we hear that Sebastapool
will be rebuilt contrary to the
stipulations of 1856, and an army
will be ready at any time to invade
Turkey. The head of the Police of St.
Petersburg has found out a conspiracy
to do away with the life of the Em-
peror. Several Poles are accused of
forming a part of the same. Spain is
still in a deplorable state, on the
verge of bankruptcy, and there is no
telling where the useless war with
Chili will lead to. Reports from South
America inform us that an attack of
the Spanish fleet on Valparaiso is
hourly expected. It is however hoped
that the presence of the English and
American ships may prevent the Span-
ish admiral from coming to extreme
measures.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the U. S. the executive and legis-
lative powers are always on cool terms.
The civil rights bill has passed a second
time notwithstanding the veto of Presi-
dent Johnson, who has declared the civil
war at an end, and that the Southern
States are now to enjoy all the rights of
the North. Congress, however is, not
of the same way of thinking, and mil-
itary rule is still maintained in the late
rebel states.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Fenianism seems to be dying a natural
death in the States. The federal gov-
ernment is doing all it can to put a
stop to the agitation amongst the Irish
in it dominions. Stephens the leader
has, it is said, left Paris after having been
feted by many of the English haters
amongst our aristocracy, first and fore-
most is the Marquis de Brissy of Anglo-
phobic propensities.{{< /news/text >}}

Summary.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(From the L. & China Express,
May 17th.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE COURT.-—Her Majesty has held a
Court, and the Prince of Wales a Levee.
The Rajah of Johore was presented and
Sir Richard McCausland, from Singapore.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}FRANCE.—-The Emperor’s speech at
Auxerre has, by order, been placarded in
every commune throughout the empire.
The idea of a Congress still keeps its
ground, and Paris seems to be the centre
of the negotiations going forward. A
mail-steamer from Mexico, arrived at St.
Nazaire, has brought three millions of
francs for the French Government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}PRUSSIA AND GERMANY.-—The Prussian
armaments are pushed forward. More
diplomatic notes have passed. Prussia
has summoned Hanover to explain her
military preparations. The Federal Diet
is attempting to hold the balance between
the two great Powers, and the mobilisa-
tion of the Federal army is contemplated.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Czar is also understood to be re-
monstrating with Prussia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}AUSTRIA.—-The concentration of forces
on the Prussian frontier has commenced.
The exportation of arms and corn is pro-
hibited. The people are supporting the
Government by patriotic movements. The
nobility are removing their valuables
from the districts likely to be the scene
of the war. An Imperial decree confers
immunity from capture at sea on mer-
chant vessels belonging to belligerents,
provided the latter adopt a reciprocal
course. A basis suggested by France, to
secure peace with Italy, is said to be the
demolition of the Quadrilateral fortresses
and the making Venice a free port.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}RUSSIA.—-Prince Gortschakoff is re-
ported to have warned Prussia that the
Czar will side with Austria should the
latter be attacked, but the statement
wants confirmation. General Romanny-
sky, the successor to Tchernaieff, has de-
feated the Bokhariotes and taken a large
booty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}HOLLAND.—-Important amendments
have been proposed on the Culture Bill,
and if carried the Ministry must resign.
In view of the warlike preparations or-
ders have been issued to be prepared for
emergencies. The banquet to Prince
Frederick has been postponed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}KINGDOM OF ITALY.—-The Govern-
ment is asserted to have declared that
the cession of Venetia must form the
basis of any peace negotiations, and that
it will wait till the 20th for the result of
diplomatic efforts. Meantime volunteers
are being enrolled ; the reserve of 1844
(that is of the youth of twenty years of
age) is incorporated with the regular
army ; the commanders-in-chief are at
the head of their corps and the fleet is
at the mouth of the Gulf of Trieste.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}DANUBIAN PRINCIPALITIES.-—The
Chambers were opened on the 11th. The
Provisional Government insists on the
union of the provinces and on the coro-
nation of a foreign Prince as Hospodar.
It is said the Paris Conference has au-
thorised the Porte to the military occupa-
tion of the country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}UNITED STATES.—-The Reconstruction
Committee have reported a Bill making
important alterations in the Constitution.
Mrs Davis has been allowed to stay at
Fortress Monroe with her husband. The
negro soldiery have been guilty of a seri-
ous riot at Memphis in which many lives
were lost. The Merchants’ National
Bank of New York has failed, and Mr.
John Ross, a broker of the same city,
has absconded, having committed for-
geries to a large amount. The Fenians,
from Eastport, have seized a British
schooner, and hoisted on her the flag of
the Irish Republic. The cholera in the
quarantine at New York has abated.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}COMMERCIAL.—-On the afternoon of
the 10th the City was thrown into immense
excitement by the stoppage of Overend,
Gurney & Co. A run ensued upon the
banks which fell on the Bank of England
who paid out about £4,000,000, and hav-
ing laid the matter before Government
they received authority to issue bank
notes beyond the limit allowed by the
charter. The failure of Sir Morton Peto,
the great contractor, followed ; also the
English Joint-Stock Bank, the Imperial
Mercantile Credit, the Commercial Bank,
of India ; Hallett, Ommancy, and Co.
Wakefield ; Nash, and Co., Liverpool
Bank and all other shares are much de-
pressed, and confidence returns very tar-
dily. The Bank rate of discount is at 10
per cent ; Consols, for account, 85½ ;
money, 86¾ to 87. At the meeting of the
Mercantile Bank the report was passed
with little discussion. The meeting of
the Hindostan will be held on the 24th.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A meeting of the shareholders of Over-
end, Gurney, and Co. has been held, at
which a rough statement of the business
was submitted with the view of showing
that the net profits had amounted to
£230,000 per annum. No more seda-
tious statement was ever paraded. It
adds insult to injury. That with the loss
of millions the concern could net profits
of hundreds of thousands is simply ridi-
culous. We hope the shareholders may
find it true.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The suspension of the Liverpool mer-
chants and shipowners, Messrs Pernie
Brothers, and Co. has been announced.
Thus ends for the present the record of
disaster. The next few days will throw
important light on the general position
of affairs.{{< /news/text >}}

Russia, Germany, &c.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The six young Japanese sent to
Russia have arrived at St. Petersbarg
and been presented at the Asiatic De-
partment to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs. The Northern Bee says: "It
is well known that the Government of
Japan, in sending these young men to
Russia, had in view a scientific object;
the eldest of them is only eighteen years
of age, and the two youngest are only
twelve. They are to receive a Eu-
ropean education, and thus acquire
knowledge that will enable them on
their return home to introduce many
improvements and inventions hitherto
totally unknown in Japan. Other
young men have been sent to France,
England, and Holland for the same
purpose. The Japanese now at St.
Peterburg were brought over in the
Russian corvette Bogatyr, which land-
ed them at Cherbourg, whence they
came on by the railway through
France and Germany. When they
presented themselves at the Asiatic
Department, under the protection of
which they will remain during their
stay in Russia, they wore European
dresses and had their hair cut, not-
withstanding which their features bear
such a striking Asiatic type as to
cause them to be immediately recog-
nized as genuine natives of Nipon."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}By the last overland mail despatches
were received at Vienna, announcing
that on the 12th of March last the Im-
perial Austrian Consulate at Bangkok
was formally and officially opened
with the consent of the Siamese Gov-
erament, and before the conclusion of
any treaty. Herr Augustus Redlich
has hoisted his flag, and officiates as
the first Austrian Consul, which may
be considered a distinguished mark of
goodwill on the part of Siam.{{< /news/text >}}

4th of July Celebration.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It gives us pleasure to notice in this
issue that the 90th anniversary of Am.
Independence was celebrated by a
portion of American residents in this
city on Wednesday, the 4th inst. at the
residence of J. M. Hood Esq., U. S.
Consul. As but a quiet and not real-
ly a public celebration of the day was
contemplated, and as the repast to
which the guests were invited was to
be only a tiffin and not a dinner, the
attendance was not as large as it other-
wise would have been. Some of our
Am. Community had previously arrang-
ed to celebrate the day, as we learned,
by a steam boat excursion to “the old
city,” and some still in other modes
according to their more personal and
independent pleasure. That any one
of the community should neglect to
remember the day with joy and some
appropriate outgushing praise we will
not believe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Those of us assembled at the Ameri-
can Consulate would doubtless have
felt more of the genuine inspiration
which the 4th of July is wont to beget
in our own fatherland, could we have
heard a national salute at sunrise, and
another at midday attended by some
martial parade led by martial music
to some of our national airs, or even
the King of Siam's brass band which
we enjoyed a year ago. A Siamese
brass band, we are informed, was ap-
plied for, but was found disbanded,
and could not be called from their
distant homes in time, and that the
firing of a national salute was impos-
sible first because no guns could be
obtained for the purpose, and second
because government has not as yet per-
mitted any representative of a foreign
nation to fire a salute. But small as
was the gathering and quiet as were
the proceedings of this celebration, it
was remarkable that with the absence
of so much with which we had been
accustomed to take inspiration at home
there was so much of the genuine
spirit of 1776 developed. Indeed we
fancy that that spirit was quickened
into new and even more vigorous life
in the bosoms of the young and middle
aged and old Americans that were
present, than in most Americans at the
commencement of our country's In-
dependence, for the soul stirring e-
vents of the ever memorable year 1865
were as fresh as but of yesterday in
every mind, demonstrating by a
thousand irresistible arguments the
blessings of Independence from kingly
and imperial sway, the unparralled
strength of a people's government,
and the glorious destiny which the
King of kings has in all probability
bequeathed to us as a nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The American Consulate at which
the Consul resides was appropriately
decorated for the occasion. Hundreds
of flags were floating in the gentle
breeze. The front verandah and the
steps leading to it were neatly arrayed
with green bushes, emblems of joy
and praise. The reception room was
charmingly draped with the ensigns
of various nations, and smiled with joy
by means of the bouquets that were
tastefully arranged among them. The
dining hall fired our hearts with the
love of country by the banner display-
ed in the farther end on which were
inscribed in large letters—LIBERTY AND
UNION. Those three words, though si-
lent to the outward ear, were full of the
most thrilling eloquence to our inward
soul, and they discoursed to us with
even more power than a dozen Daniel
Websters united could have done be-
cause that great man and his illustri-
ous compeers died before our late
baptism in blood and fire.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having been seated a few minutes
in the reception room, Mr. Hood arose
and gave his guests a very hearty re-
ception which he followed with a neat
and appropriate address. We here give
entire what he said.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
ADDRESS
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a gratification to meet so large
a number of American citizens in this
beautiful portion of the eastern world,
on this our nation's festal day; and as
the representative of that great na-
tion, I bid you a hearty welcome to
my home, and entertainment, believ-
ing, as I do, that the interchange of
friendly greetings upon this auspicious
occasion, will conduce to our future
welfare, and happiness. Again I bid
you welcome.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Permit me at this time to remark
that of all the memorable days in
the history of our beloved country,
this our natal day towers above
them in sublimity of thought and
grand conceptions, and calls forth our
adoration for our self-sacrificing, and
noble minded progenitors, who freely
gave their lives, and fortunes, that a
nation of freeman might live and bless
the world with the sublime idea, that
man, was endowed by his creator, with
self governing faculties, and that the
Divine right of kings, to rule the world,
has from the birth of our nation, been
fading from the minds of the people
everywhere—-and now but few crown-
ed heads in the western world have
any other claim to rule his brother man,
than that which the people have seen
it expedient to bestow.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The late struggle in our beloved
country, has demonstrated to the world
the strength and endurance of a free
people, and their capacity for self-gov-
ernment. These self-evident truths,
encourage us onward in the noble
work of disseminating American ideas,
American literature, and American man-
ners, and customs. This will tend to
a better understanding of us as a na-
tion in foreign lands.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}None can so well estimate how bles-
sed is the country of our nativity, as
the citizens of the United States, who
travel abroad and compare the institu-
tions of his home, with those he meets
with; when he sees the misery and deg-
radation of the laboring classes, then
he may turn his mind to his own, his
native land, and exclaim how blessed
are we as a nation, where every man
feels that he is a part of the govern-
ment, and has a voice in making its
laws. And I pray an all-wise provi-
dence, to watch over, and protect us,
as a nation, for all future time. And
that our free institutions, may contin-
ue to bless the world at large.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the language of the Immortal
Webster let us proclaim, LIBERTY AND
UNION, ONE AND INSEPARABLE.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After the address Young America
consisting of a about a dozen American
children under the lead of Miss F.
Dean their elder at the Melodian sang
Hail Columbia to the words.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent2 >}}Hail Columbia! happy land!

{{< news/indent2 >}}Hail ye heroes heaven born band;

{{< news/text >}}The next move was for each gentle-
man to conduct a lady to the tiffin
tables in the dining hall. The tables
were bountifully furnished with all
that a man can with any propriety
desire for a midday lunch.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was a little remarkable that we
had no kind of drink presented to us
that could become a mocker or con-
vert any one of us to raging and folly.
Having finished the tiffin the Con-
sul announced that it was then in or-
der to give toasts, saying that having
no wine they could be drank quite
appropriately with the pure water of
life from heaven. A toast was promised
by Dr. B. provided he could have Dr.
D. sustain it by one of his own happy
speeches. The latter gentleman giv-
ing, as was thought, a tacit consent,
a sentiment was offered. It was this—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Liberty and Union and equality
for all men of our country before
the law of the land as all are equal
before the law of God.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The explanation of the meaning of
the word Equality was called for by
the Consul, which called out a defini-
tion substantially—-that all men without
respect to rank, caste, or color, are by
the Constitution of the U. S. equally
entitled to manhood, citizenship, and
personal protection in all their land-
able pursuits of happiness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With this explanation Dr. D. arose
and gave us an elaborate and interest-
ing extempore speech well sustaining
the sentiments of the toast. He dwelt
upon the idea of equality and stated
with great clearness that our Am. Con-
stitution does hold all classes of A-
merican subjects equal before the law—
be they German, or Irishmen, or Afri-
cans, or the pure white native born
Americans, that every class of men is
equally entitled to protection by the
laws of the land—-having equal rights
to the influence of their votes in the
election of their own rulers, and that
it is an outrage of common sense
as well as of common justice to say or
think that color should ever have any
thing to do in forming an estimate of
man's equality before the laws of our
country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But while holding to these views, he
said he must advocate that there are
certain limitations of the privileges of
suffrage to individuals in every class,
not more so in regard to the blacks
than of the whites, which has always
obtained in our government and which
he hoped ever would. He alluded to
many among white men as well as a-
mong black men, who were as yet
quite disqualified for the freedom of
the elective franchise because of their
ignorance. All such he would have
held back from the ballot box until
they shall have qualified themselves for
suffrage by being able to read and
write, and thus attain to some respon-
sible status in the land. The speaker
could not accord with many leaders of
the Republican party who seemed bent
upon universal and indiscriminate suf-
frage either for white men or black.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Dr. then proceeded to speak of
Prest. Johnson and his policy of Re-
construction. He gave the Prest. a
high and just eulogium, showing that
he had been every inch a man of
most extraordinary symmetry from
his youth to the Presidential chair.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All the speaker said up to this point
seemed to meet the full accord of all his
hearers. But when he came to extol
the restoration of the Southern States
to their former status in the govern-
ment of our country, and advocate
that such restoration was their just
due and that it was purely fidelity to
the Constitution and love of the Un-
ion which had led the Prest. to a-
dopt the policy he had and to stand so
firmly to his purpose against the
mighty power of Congress and in the
face of the most unjust vitoperations
and obloquy, then there appeared a
marked division in the assembly.
The same two parties—the President's
party and the Congress party, that
now figure at home stoodforth in
bold relief, but as we are happy
to report, without a hiss or even a
word or look of disrespect.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dr. B. then arose and expressed
much pleasure to find as he did, that the
views of his "twin brother" and his own
on the great question of political equal-
ity were so nearly in harmony, and
stated briefly the reasons why Congress
could not adopt Mr. Johnson's policy
of reconstruction, and why he himself
must stand by Congress in this vital
question. He said Congress had obtain-
ed the most reliable information from al-
most all parts of the South, showing
that the spirit of the rebellion and
Yankee-hate was far from being dead,
or even dying in the bosoms of the
50,000 Southern political leaders, and
that to allow them to send representa-
tives into Congress now, would produce
unending discord in the very centre and
heart of our country, and in all proba-
bility soon begot another civil war. He
stated the astounding fact that the
present Mayor of Mobile had recently
in a public assembly toasted Jefferson
Davis, that arch leader of the rebellion
as being a patriot worthy of the high-
est praise and everlasting veneration
by all the South, that the toast express-
ed the unanimous feelings of the great
assembly he was addressing, and that
that was very probably the sentiment
of a large majority of the leaders of
Southern politicians. If such, he asked,
be the spirit of the South, how sad,
how ruinous, would it be to have those
states restored to power in Congress!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Here the speaking ended: but the
toast was not drank nor a vote taken
to try the strength of the two par-
ties, as neither were needed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The party then rising from table at
the lead of the Consul, returned to the
reception room, when young America
sang the "Star spangled banner" to
the words usually set to it. This was
followed by the good old Republican
and time revered tune "Yankee doo-
dle" to truthful and jovial words
showing the origin of the tune, and
the spirit that inspired it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The children carried all the parts
and performed it admirably.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After a due pause the sweet singers
sang for their closing piece a touching
song on The grave of Washington.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having carried out all the pro-
gramme which the Consul and his la-
dy had designed for the occasion, the
heavens then stooped, as if in lively
sympathy with us, and gave us a grand
out-pouring of wind and rain, those
vitalizing and fructifying elements of
all national prosperity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus ended our celebration much
to the gratification of all that were
present, with thankfulness to our Con-
sul and his good lady for the enter-
tainment they had given us, and grate-
ful regards to all others who volun-
teered their aid in preparing it.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Petohaburee.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Burron,—In your account of
your late visit to our place you made
a very complimentary and eloquent
allusion to our Mission compound.
We think ourselves that it is a pleas-
ant spot, and surely it never looked
so lovely in our eyes as it did yester-
day morning. The tall and ever grace-
ful clusters of the bamboo in the ad-
joining temple grounds, which protect
us from the rays of the morning sun—
the two tamarind trees in front, the
row of cocoanuts on the opposite side
all serving as a partial natural bound-
ary—a cove in the bosom of which
our houses are situated and even the
Cape Jesamins and smaller shrub-
berry and flowers had all put on their
loveliest hue. The charm was pro-
bably not so much in the place itself,
which was essentially just as we had
seen it for weeks, nor was it altogether
to be attributed to the peculiar still-
ness and beauty of the Sabbath morn-
ing, which has followed us with its
hallowed associations from childhood,
and even in this land of idols where
there are no Sabbaths, seems still to
distinguish it from the other days of
the week; I suppose it was principal-
ly in our own subjective feelings, sug-
gested by the contrast of what had
well nigh become during the previous
night.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}About nine o’clock on Saturday
night the alarm of fire was given on
the place. We soon found that it pro-
ceeded from that thick cluster of Siam-
ese houses, to the west about thirty
paces from our enclosure, and about
the same distance from the river. The
first sight that we saw of it forced on
our minds the fearful danger to which
we were exposed. Anxious to see its
real position, and following our first
instinct, we hastened out to the place
and found that it had originated in a
vacant house built by the Roman Ca-
tholics, and used by them as a place of
worship during the visits of the priests
to this place. It had a brick founda-
tion about five feet high with the walls
of bamboo and the roof of attap. On-
ly a few feet from it, and still nearer to
our place was another vacant house
owned by Tow Kee Yee. When we
reached the spot the flames had just
caught on the roof of this second house.
About six feet from the first roof or
chapel was a large old shed, and about
ten feet from the second and still near-
er our lot was a Siamese granary co-
vered with attap, and from that was a
continuous row of houses joined to-
gether with scarcely any intervening
space up to our mission fence. About
the same distance on the side towards
the river there commenced another
series of houses owned by another
Chinese Tan Kee, extending almost
continuously out to the river and end-
ing again at the house of the Siamese
officer just adjoining the mission lot.
It was in that narrow compass of a-
bout ten feet on each side that the
two houses on fire were situated, pass-
ing beyond the bounds of which in ei-
ther of those two directions it would
have been almost impossible to have
prevented a universal conflagration of
the whole village around us, and also
the most if not the whole of the mis-
sion property too.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A great many natives had assembled
when we reached there, enough to ex-
tinguish the fire in a short time had
one half of them laid hold and brought
a bucket of water or assisted in tear-
ing down the buildings. But the per-
fect indifference with which they ga-
zed on the scene is almost incredible.
When upbraided for their indifference
a vacant stare was all that they gave.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I found that my associate had just
reached the place, and was laying hold
himself and urging on the indifferent
spectators. The wind, though slight,
was just in the direction to carry the
sparks and burning attap over some
place and the intervening houses. So
leaving Mr. McFarland there I has-
tened back to see what was best to be
done to preserve our own premises. I
had taken the precaution at the begin-
ning of the last dry season to have
several long ladders made, little think-
ing that we would have to use them
so soon. We soon arranged the few
men on our side of the lot to the best
apparent advantage, placing a couple on
our own attap roofed house to extin-
guish the falling sparks, and the teach-
er and washerman, on the workman's
and watchman's houses for the same
purpose. Mr. McFarland's house had
recently been covered with tiles and
was in less danger; but the houses oc-
cupied by his servants were adjoining
the fence on the side of the fire, and
were in the greatest danger of all and
must inevitably be burned if the fire
extended any further. So having
made the best preparations under the
circumstances for the defence of my
own house, I stood out in his back
lot where I could assist in wetting the
roofs off from those most in danger, and
watch the progress of the fire.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Meanwhile the ladies had begun in
good earnest to remove the effects
from the house, one of them taking the
children and placing them with the
nurse under the large tamarind tree
in front, and another, forgetting her
accustomed weakness, dragged out a
large trunk that required a couple of
men to bring back. A large pile of
clothing and other articles were thus
stored out in the front wall. In this,
under the circumstances, they acted
wisely, though word was soon sent that
the fire was subsiding and would not
extend further, and the whole work of
demolishing the attap roofs and re-
moving the articles from the house
was stopped. You are better able to
imagine our feelings of gratitude and
joy than I can describe them, when we
felt that all danger was surely over.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We could but admire the special
providence of God in preventing such
an occurrence during the dry season,
when the whole settlement would pro-
bably have been swept away. Provi-
dentially, too, that very afternoon there
had been a slight sprinkle of rain,
enough to prevent the rapid extension
of the fire in the houses that had
caught and also its easy ignition in
the others. A green tree between the
Siamese granary and the Tow Kee's
house was also of much service in pro-
tecting it. In all probability the fire
was the work of an incendiary, and it is
currently believed that it was done by
those to whom the houses and pro-
perty are committed by the Tow
Kee when he is away. Report says
that they had gambled and lost and
pawned away most of the property and
had then set fire to the premises.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first part of the report is doubt-
less true, but as there is no evidence
as to their agency in the fire except
common suspicion founded on the
facts stated, nothing will probably be
done with them. We understand that
one of the Siamese officers came down
next morning to make inquiries about
the origin of the fire and here the mat-
ter will end. We fear it is only one
of the many instances in which the
gross crimes will be allowed to pass
unpunished as we have no longer the
strong hand of our worthy and tried
friend the Lieutenant Governor to be a
terror to evil doers and bring offenders
to punishment.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}THREE CHINESE converts to Chris-

Dr. Dean. They assembled with the
church and a company of spectators, on
the banks of the river under the shade
of a grove of bamboo and plantain trees,
when the third chapter of Matthew
was read, giving an account of the
baptism of Jesus by John in the river
Jordan. Then the Chinese deacon of-
fered prayer, and the pastor led the
converts one by one down into the
river, and baptised them in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, the candidates each
responding with a hearty Amen—-as
they rose from the water. The ser-
vices closed with prayer and the bene-
diction. On the same day these bap-
tised disciples were received into the
church by the right-hand of fellow-
ship and took their seats at the Lord's
table. This church, organized twen-
ty nine years ago, under the charge
of its present pastor, has had a history
of mingled trial and prosperity, which
has developed bright examples of
Christianity redeemed from heathenism.
has proved the mother of the churches
Hongkong and Swatow, having the

and some of its former members are
still living in their native district in
China, as living epistles of Christ,

of the church on receiving the last
addition to their number yesterday,
is chastened by the necessity of
withdrawing the hand of fellowship
from one of its former members, who
had forfeited his claim to their con-
fidence by unchristian language and

{{< news/text >}}Ms. WESTERFIELD'S Helena, was not
allowed to start with the others and
was quietly withdrawn.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They started at ¼ to 12 o'clock with
a light S. W. breeze and ebb tide, and
rounded in the above-named order. The
first boat with a red flag stationed near-
ly opposite the Paknam forts. Soon
after passing the canoe No. 4 took the
lead and kept it all alone, followed by
the others in beating out to the Sun-
ken Junks, where a second boat with
a red flag was stationed and which
was rounded by No. 4 at ¼ past one
o'clock and followed by No. 1 at ten
minutes later. No. 2 and 3 went round
this boat fifteen minutes afterwards
both nearly at the same time. Just
then Yacht No. 5 being about 1 ¼ miles
astern capsized (the real cause I have
not ascertained) and the four Europeans
and six Malays got unexpectedly a
cold bath. The yacht filled very quick-
ly and all hands clung to the masts.
H. B. M. Consul yacht Kestrel, and
the S. S. Morning Star, both with
guests on board to witness the regatta
were luckily not far from the sunken
boom, and went with all haste to the
assistance of those in the water. The
Kestrel pulled up two Europeans and
the Morning Star, the others two
Europeans and the six Malays. The
other four yachts were still continuing
their course, and No. 4 keeping the
lead, rounded the second time the first
boat opposite the Paknam forts fol-
lowed by No. 1, 2 and 3. By this
time the tide had changed and a hea-
vy squall was coming and No. 2 and 3
withdrew from the race, the ballast of
the latter having shifted the yacht was
run for safety on a bank; but by
doing so the rudder was lost. No. 1
and 4 then gave the race up on ac-
count of the lateness in the day and
the threatening weather with a con-
trary tide. The Foam, was taken to
Paknam the same evening, the wa-
ter bailed out, and afterwards towed
to town by a little steamer. On the
whole the day was fine and pleasant.
Besides a number of houseboats with
residents, there was the S. S. Morn-
ing Star, chartered for the occasion
with a number of ladies and gentle-
men H. B. M. U's. yacht Kestrel, with
some friends of the owner. Mr. Wes-
terfield's yacht Helena, with some of
his friends. The steamer and the
Kestrel, followed the racing yachts all
the distance, but the Helena, having
grounded on a bank opposite the start-
ing place very shortly after the regatta
commenced, was thereby prevented
from following the racing yachts to
the Sunken Junks. Between 3 and 4
o'clock the steamer and other boats all

{{< news/text >}}ANGHIN SANITARIUM.—-Our readers
will with us rejoice in the announce-
ment among our local items of to day's
issue that we have now in Siam a real
and thorough Sanitarium just com-
pleted through the most gracious
grants of His MAJESTY THE KING of
Siam, and His Majesty's government
under the superintendence of His Ex-
cellency the Premier Chow Phya Kala-
home. It is delightfully situated at
Anghin a small town on the eastern
gulf-coast 6 miles S. W. of Banplasoi
and about 60 miles from Bangkok. A
better location for a Sanitarium, could
not, probably, be found in this country
or any other within the tropics, en-
joying as it does an elevation above
the level of the sea from 50 to 60
feet, being neither too high nor to
low to be ever too damp, and with the
most perfect freedom of air in both
monsoons—-the one from the N. E.
blowing across a small bay—-the other
from the S. W. blowing directly up
the gulf. Not only the pure air com-
ing over the briny deep, but also the
charming music of the ocean waves
made by their dashing on the rock-
bound point of Anghin, and her long
line of sea beach leading from it
Southward on which invalids may
walk evening and morning and amuse
themselves in shell-hunting and other-
wise, must, we think, conspire to cheer
their spirits and promote restoration to
health.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Sanitarium is of ready and
pleasant access from Bangkok. It
may be reached by a sailing boat usu-
ally within twelve hours and by row-
ing via the canal to Bangkaboon river,
thence to Bangplasoi and thence across
a small bay 6 miles in less than 40
hours.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This Sanitarium is another mark of
progress in Siam, and it is to us a very
agreeable one, praise great is due to His
Majesty and to his Majesty's Premier for
the accomplishment of it. For further
particulars see the advertisement head-
ed Anghin Sanitarium.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}M. Aubaret, Consul for the French
Government, arrived on the 30th ulto. having been
brought by H. I. M.'s Ship-of-war Cos-
[...], and carrying ten

{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We learn that M. Aubaret had an
audience of the Emperor, Napoleon
III "who gave him a sword as a pre-
sent from himself to the King of Siam,
and a dagger from the Prince Impe-
rial for the King's son."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The Cosmao, brought a European
Mail with dates of papers from Lon-
don to the 17th May from Hongkong

the 4th of June, from which there
would seem but little hope of averting
the terrible catastrophe of a general
European war.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}As His Majesty the king is not
pleased with the mention we made in
our last issue of the joke he is said
to have passed on the Pope concern-
ing keeping the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, we beg to assure him that
no European of common sense will
understand from our remarks that His
Majesty ever spake or wrote that for
the press, nor that His Majesty could
have seriously intended to cast any
dishonour on the Pope even if that keen
repartee did drop from his lips. A good
Roman Catholic ruler, even in France
could have uttered the same jokingly
as did His Majesty, and not fear con-
demnation from any quarter. And
shall the king of Siam sitting as he
does on his own independent throne,
and that founded on Buddhism, sur-
rounded, though he be, by many of
the representatives of the great West-
ern Powers have less freedom in this
regard! If so where is his glory!{{< /news/text >}}

Progress of Loyal Feeling.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
New York Observer, April 19TH 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}We watch, with anxiety, the manifest-
ations of Southern feeling toward the
Government of the United States. It is
well known to all the readers of this pa-
per that we have strenuously urged the
speediest possible restoration of the in-
surgent States to their old STATUS in the
Union, and that we desire the return of
peace in all relations, civil, social and ec-
clesiastical. It will surprise some to know
that we have pursued this course, while
many at the South are writing to us that
we are going too fast, that the state of
feeling does not justify immediate restor-
ation, that so much of the war-spirit still
prevails, that the people cannot send
Union men to Congress. But we have
felt that kindness was the most effectual
means of conciliation, and that the war
had forever settled the question of seces-
sion and nationality. We have been
willing to trust the South, and to aid in
building up her waste places, and to res-
tore the harmony of the republic with
the least possible delay.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But we are pained by the necessity of
saying that the information we get from
the South does not encourage us to labor
in this direction. Particularly is the in-
telligence unfavorable in regard to the
ministers of the South. A pastor in one
of the Southern States writes as follows:
"It is a fact that the ministers of the
Gospel in the South, who have generally
returned to their parishes, are almost
without exception bitterly opposed to the
Government, and are exerting all their
influence against loyalty and reconstruc-
tion. It is the opinion of candid loyal
men, that they are exerting a stronger
influence in that direction than any other
class of men in the South.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"These ministers teach their people
not to listen to any propositions for aid
in supplying preaching for the destitute:
or organizing and furnishing Sunday
schools, unless these funds be put into
the hands of true Southern men, go for
their support and to advance their prin-
ciples.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"A Christian gentleman, who has re-
cently visited every town in nine counties
in this State, on business, and made this
a special subject of inquiry, says it was
the testimony of the best men everywhere
that no Northern missionary or S. S.
agent would be safe from personal viol-
ence. The spirit is bitter, very bitter,
and so far as I can see, grows worse."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And we have MANY other letters to the
same purport. To the same effect is the
following item in the secular newspapers:
At a celebration in Mobile, on the 10th,
Mayor Withers being called on for a
sentiment, said: "I rise, Mr. Chairman,
to propose a sentiment which, I think
should not be omitted on any occasion of
this kind. I mean no treason, nor do I
mean to revive any memories of the past
which ought to be dead and buried. I
simply offer the health of a distinguish-
ed gentleman. I give you, therefore, sir:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"President Davis, soldier, statesman,
patriot, prisoner. Our tongues may be
mute, but our hearts are with him."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such a sentiment given by the mayor
of a city, at a public celebration, and of
course approved by the people, is a suff-
iciently explicit declaration of the amount
of loyalty prevailing. Here is an act of
homage to a man as PRESIDENT, who is
the representative of the entire rebellion,
and who cannot now be recognized as
President by any man who is not thorough-
ly disloyal to the Government of the
United States.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Of what use, then, is it that we at the
North advocate the restoration of the
South to her STATUS in the Union, when
the clergy still preach hostility to the
Government, and the mayor of Mobile,
with the approbation of his fellow citi-
zens, pays public honors to "President"
Davis? To us it seems wonderful that
men can expect to have the confidence,
support and material aid of the North,
while they thus continue to nurture and
spread a feeling of disloyalty and posi-
tive hostility to the government under
which they live.{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But we know that the present genera-
tion will pass away, and a new generation
will take their places, before the South
will be represented in Congress, if in
public meetings Jeff. Davis continues to
be toasted as a patriot, and the ministers
of the gospel foster unfriendliness to the
Government of the Union.{{< /news/text >}}

A NEW DISCOVERY
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(THE AGUE PLANT.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The "ague plant" has recently been
discovered—-not the plant that cures
ague, but the one that causes it. Here is
one plant, at least, that we can notice
without being overwhelmed with applica-
tions for seed. To be sure, it is a little
thing, and takes a good eye, aided by a
good microscope, to find it, but when
found, it cannot be said it "is no great
shakes," for it is the "genuine Shaker
seedling" itself. Doctor J. H. Salisbury,
of Cleveland, Ohio, announces in the
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCI-
ENCES, that fever and ague is caused by
a minute plant, which is found where
stagnant water has just dried away. The
spores, or reproductive dust of this
microscopic plant, are diffused through
the night damps, and being taken into
the system by breathing, are the cause of
that wide spread scourge, the ague. The
habits of these minute plants completely
accord with what was before known of
the occurrence of miasm, and that they
are the real cause of it has been shown
by taking boxes of earth containing them,
to places where an ague was never known
to occur. In about two weeks after the
ague plant was taken there, well marked
cases of the disease appeared. This
discovery does not, as yet, increase our
knowledge of the means of ridding our-
selves of the plant, but it will probably
lead to that; just as one, if he can only
find out "how he got such a cold," is al-
ready half cured. The spores only rise
in the night, and then to a height varying
with the locality, of from thirty to one
hundred feet. This explains why night
air brings on ague, and why elevated lo-
calities are free from it. After the ague
seed is taken into the system, the plant is
propagated there, and the patient be-
comes a sort of animated hot bed.—

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Ten years in Sarawak.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}An interesting work on Borneo, its cli-
mate, inhabitants and geology, entitled
"TEN YEARS IN SARAWAK," written by
Mr. Charles Brooke, has been lately pub-
lished in London. The author is a neph-
ew of Sir James Brooke, Rajah of Sara-
wak, who has written an introduction to
the book. He first introduces the reader
to his nephew, who he says "is looked
up to (in Sarawak) as the chief of all the
Sea Dyaks, or coast natives, and whose
intimate knowledge of their language,
customs, and habits, gives him an un-
bounded influence over them. His task
has been successfully accomplished of
trampling out the last efforts of the pira-
tical Malayan chiefs, and their supporters
among other tribes of Dyaks and of the
other countries he describes. He first
gained over a portion of these Dyaks to
the cause of order, and then used them
as his instruments in the same cause, to
restrain their countrymen. The result
has been that the coast of Sarawak is as
safe to the trader as the coast of Eng-
land, and that an unarmed man can trav-
erse the country without let or hind-
rance."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The Rajah then tells us of his hopes
and fears for the future of his adopted
country, and in language which all must
sympathize with who admire his courage
and patriotism. He speaks sadly of his
rose colored hopes of assistance from
England in organising his government
and settling the country, and how deeply
he has felt the disappointment which her
apathy has caused him. Then he tells us
in a few simple words how he has con-
soled himself by advancing the happiness
of his people. The result is that the
citizen of Sarawak "has every privilege
enjoyed by the citizen of England, and
far more personal freedom that is known
in a thickly populated country. The
people are not taught industry by being
forced to work. They take a part in the
Government under which they live; they
are consulted upon the taxes they pay
(by means of a native 'council'), and, in
short, they are free men."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"To secure however the permanency of
civilized rule, and thus offer the security
of Western laws to life and property,
which would induce emigration to the is-
land, the protection of some powerful
nation is necessary, as in the case of the
Sandwich Islands, which under nearly
similar conditions, have under the protec-
torate of England been steadily progres-
sing in the track of progress and civiliza-
tion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The work thus introduced contains the
most complete account of Borneo, which
has ever appeared, as it contains the ex-
perience of ten years in the country,
which period the author has devoted to
the establishment of his Government
and the development of the resources of
the country. The customs, habits and
character of the people are described
with much detail in a lively narrative of
events and of romantic adventure which
make us thoroughly acquainted with the
interior of native society. In describing
the resources of the island great stress is
laid on the certainty in the mind of the
writer of the existence of extensive and
paying gold fields in the interior of the
country, which would convert it into a
second California and from the descrip-
tion of the physical features of the land
surface, and geological formations, is
would seem highly probable that Mr.
Brooke's edea' is not a visionary one.
That the savage inhabitants are stupid
and violent beyond control, is sufficiently
disproved by the firm sway which the
Rajah holds over a large section of them,
and although they have naturally all the
vices of Asiatics, being indolent and
superstitious to a degree, they are easily
led by kindness and firmness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The author in the close of his work
discusses the furture prospects of the
country as respects population and Gov-
ernment, by which it appears that at pre-
sent the rate of increase of population is
nearly equal to that of England. This
would lead us to hope that the natives of
Borneo are not destined to be gradually
trodden out by the advancing stride of
western civilization; and in the face of
the universal decimation and final anni-
hilation of aborigines in all parts of the
world, which the advent of cotton goods,
white men and rum, have caused in every
country colonised, it is a pleasing proof
of the humane and judicious sway of our
countrymen in Sarawak, that the popula-
tion is actually increasing, and that the
natives are happy and contented under
their rulers. Mr. Brooke's work will be
eagerly read by many, for the sake of its
varied information and lively scraps of
anecdote and adventure.{{< /news/text >}}

Thick clouds of them have alighted on

America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The President had sent to the House
of Representatives important diplomatic
correspondence relating to Mexico. Sub-
joined are abstracts of the several dis-
patches:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 12th February last Mr. Seward
addressed a communication to M. Mon-
tholon, citing and answering in detail the
arguments advanced by M. Drouyn de
Lhuys in January in defence of the
course pursued by France in Mexico.
M. Drouyn de Lhuys had declared that
the objects of the French Mexican ex-
pedition were not hostile to the institu-
tions of the New World, nor was it de-
sired to realise ambitious schemes or to
impose monarchical government upon
Mexico against the will of the people,
but only to obtain just reparation for the
wrongs of French residents, and to secure
guarantees for their future rights. A
number of influential men in Mexico, in-
cluding one of the late Presidents, des-
paired of obtaining order under Repub-
lican government, and favoured the re-
establishment of royalty. France sus-
tained an imperial government in Mexico,
founded on the consent of the people,
because that government furnished the
requisite reparation and guarantees. M.
Drouyn de Lhuys further alluded to the
aid furnished to the United States by
France during the revolutionary war, to
the proposal that the United States should
join the Mexican expedition, and to the
neutrality observed by France during the
late rebellion.—-Mr. Seward, in reply, ac-
knowledged the traditional friendship be-
tween the two countries, and the respect
and consideration due to the representa-
tions of France, but the Federal govern-
ment had seen no satisfactory evidence
that the people of Mexico originally ac-
cepted the so-called empire, nor could
any such acceptance be lawfully procured
in presence of the French army of invasion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In another despatch M. Drouyn de
Lhuys alluded to the former friendly re-
lations between the United States and the
Emperor Iturbide. Intestine war had be-
come the normal condition of Mexico,
and the present opposition to Maximilian
was only the result of previous anarchy.
All States needed allies, and French aid
did not divest the revolutionary war of its
true national character.—-Mr. Seward re-
plies that nations have no right to correct
each other's errors, except to protect
their own interests. The United States
did not regard the government of Maxi-
milian as legitimate or capable of forming
alliances. M. Drouyn de Lhuys urged
the advantages to the United States from
a stable government in Mexico; these
advantages Mr. Seward admitted, but
declared they cannot counterbalance the
injury caused by the overthrow of the
republic. The United States would feel
gratified when the French emperor gave
definite information when the French
forces would be withdrawn from Mexico.
The withdrawal need not be delayed un-
der any apprehension that the United
States would prove unfaithful to their
declared policy of non-intervention.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On April 6, 1866, M. Drouyn de Lhuys
wrote to M. de Montholon that the French
government recognised the desire of the
United States to cause the traditional
sentiments of amity between the two coun-
tries to prevail over the divergencies of
government relations. France receives with
confidence the assurance that the United
States will not prove unfaithful to their
promise of non-intervention, and finds
therein sufficient guarantee no longer to
delay the withdrawal of the French forces.
The emperor has decided that his troops
should evacuate Mexico in three detach-
ments—-the first in November next, the
second in March 1867, and the third in
November, 1867.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On March 18 Mr. Seward wrote to Mr.
Motley, the American minister at Vienna,
acknowledging the receipt of his com-
munication wherein the latter announced
the probability that Austria would consent
to and permit the levy of 4000 volunteers
for Mexico. Mr. Motley was instructed
emphatically to protest against such a
proceeding, and to state that in the event
of hostilities being prosecuted in Mexico
by Austrian subjects in the manner de-
scribed, the United States will regard it
as a war between the Republic of Mexico
and Austria, and cannot engage to remain
neutral spectators.—-On April 16 Mr.
Seward again wrote to Mr. Motley ac-
knowledging the receipt of a despatch
from him informing Mr. Seward that 1000
Austrians were about to embark for
Mexico at Trieste. Mr. Motley was in-
structed to inform the Austrian govern-
ment that the United States regarded the
despatch of Austrian troops to Mexico
while negotiations were pending with
serious concern.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A Wholesale Murderer.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A series of murders rivalling any
chronicled in English criminal annals has
been perpetrated in the suburbs of Phila-
delphia. On a small farm, scarcely a
mile from the densely populated portions
of Philadelphia, lived a grazier named
Christopher Deering, who raised cattle
and sold them to the city butchers. Deer-
ing had a wife and five small children,
the eldest 10 years of age, the youngest
a babe at the mother's breast. A niece
about 35 years of age also lived with him;
and the cattle and two or three horses
owned by the head of the family were
taken care of by an apprentice boy aged
17, and a German farm labourer who was
a discharged soldier and had been em-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ployed on the farm for about two months.
Being a dealer in cattle, Mr. Deering oc-
casionally had large sums of money in
his possession, and this is believed to
have prompted the terrible crime. On
Saturday, the 7th of April, Mr. Deering
was in the city with his niece and drove
home in a one-horse waggon. His eldest
boy at the same time went on a visit to
a relative in the city; a visit which saved
his life. After Saturday Mr. Deering was
not seen alive. As he lived in a some-
what isolated section he was not visited
very frequently, and it was not until late
on the afternoon on the following Wed-
nesday, the 11th of April, that any one
had occasion to go to his house. This casual
visitor found all the doors locked and
could not effect an entrance, but hearing
the horses and cattle making a great noise
in a stable and barn near by, he went to
see what was the matter there. The
poor animals having had nothing to eat
for five days were famished, and in mov-
ing about the barn to procure them food
and water the visitor saw a sight which
thrilled him with horror. On the barn floor,
partly covered with hay, were seven dead
bodies. Almost paralyzed with fright,
he managed to summon people from the
neighbouring farms, and the terrible tra-
gedy was disclosed. Deering's body was
out, the skull smashed by a heavy blow,
and the throat cut from ear to ear; his
wife's was also drawn out, her skull
smashed and her throat cut. Then came
the corpse of the niece, her skull also
smashed and her throat cut. Then, in
quick succession the four little children
were found, all with skulls broken and
throats cut, even the poor little babe,
scarcely a year old, helpless and incapa-
ble of resistance, having suffered the fate
that overwhelmed the others. The deed
had been complete, and the family thus
heaped together had apparently died to-
gether. The house had been ransacked
from garret to cellar. The beds were{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ripped open, chests of drawers stove in,
and furniture broken. But who did this
terrible deed? Suspicion naturally rested
upon the apprentice boy and the Ger-
man labourer. A further search, how-
ever, disclosed the dead body of the boy,
concealed under a haystack, about 100
yards from the house. His skull had
been broken by a hammer, which lay be-
side the body, and his throat had also
been cut. The unexampled atrocity of
a man committing eight murders in cold
blood, one after the other; killing four
little inoffensive children, smashing their
heads and cutting their throats, was
enough to make all who heard of it an-
xious to ferret out the murderer. The
popular solution of his mode of operation
was, that taking advantage of the ab-
sence of Mr. Deering and his niece, the
German first killed the apprentice boy
to get him out of the way. This was
done outside the house, as all the mur-
ders were, for there was no blood in the
house. He then decoyed the mother to
the barn, and she naturally carried the
babe with her, and he made away with
both of them. To decoy the three other
children to the barn and kill them was
an easy task. This was done during the
absence of Deering and his niece in the
city. For a desperate man to make away
with the drover when he reached home
and went to put his horse in the stable
was also easy. Deering's horse, when the
murder was discovered, was tied to the
manager; and the niece, missing all the
others, naturally went to the barn where
her uncle had last gone, and she was kill-
ed too. The murderer then went to the
house, ransacked it, changed his clothes
(for his bloody garments were found in
an upper chamber), and escaped. This
unparalleled atrocity having appalled
every-one in that section of country, peo-
ple answering the description of the Ger-
man were narrowly scanned. Search was
made all over the city, and many persons
were arrested, and among them the veri-
table German himself. He had never
left town. He had walked about in open
daylight for three days after the murder
was discovered. His arrest was hailed
with delight, and great masses of people
clustered round the police-station, de-
manding that he be given them to hang.
He was with difficulty taken before the
mayor, and squads of armed police were
required to guard the carriage in which
he was conveyed from the assaults of the
infuriated mob. The German told his
story, and said the family were murdered
as described above, but laid the chief
part of the crime on an accomplice. The
accomplice, he said killed the family; he,
the apprentice boy, and it had all been
done with axes and a hammer. They
plundered the house and got a few trin-
kets, some clothes, and 350 dels. in money.
This terrible crime had been committed to
secure a sum of not more than £70! The
German says he never saw his accomplice
before the murder; and this fact, with
the general incoherence of the whole
story about the accomplice, leads to the
inference that the German did all the
horrid deed himself.{{< /news/text >}}
