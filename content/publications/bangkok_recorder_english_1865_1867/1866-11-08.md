{{< news/text >}}UNITED STATES.-—President Johnson
and suite continue their tour through the
west. At some places the President's
speeches are interrupted by hoots and his-
ses, and cries of “Traitor” Mr. Seward in
his speech foreshadowed the early down-
fall of the Republicans if they continued
in their radical course. Fears are enter-
tained of political riots in Chicago during
the President's visit there. The Board of
Trade have refused the use of their hall
for the President's reception.{{< /news/text >}}

The French Circular Note.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Marquis de Lavalette has addressed
to the French diplomatic agents in for-
eign parts a circular dated the 16th inst.,
which is very pacific in tone. After show-
ing that the recent changes in Europe are
favourable to France, the circular pro-
ceeds:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The coalition of the three Northern
Courts is broken up. The new principle
ruling in Europe is the liberty of allian-
ces. Aggrandised Prussia secures the in-
dependence of Germany. France will not
feel disposed to oppose or to regret the
work of assimilation which has just been
accomplished and to subordinate to feel-
ings of jealousy the principles of national-
ities which represent and profess regard
for the peoples. By imitating France, Ger-
many has taken a step which draws her
nearer to us. Notwithstanding unreflec-
ting susceptibilities, Italy has equally
drawn nearer to us in ideas, principles,
and interests. The September Convention,
which secures the Pontificial interests,
will be loyally carried out. Second class
naval forces are arising in the Baltic and
Mediterranean, which assure liberty of
those seas. Austria, relieved of her Ita-
lian and German leanings, and no longer
employing her forces in barren rivalries,
but concentrating them upon the East of
Europe, still represents 35 million souls,
whom no hostile interests separate from
France. By what singular reaction of the
past upon the future shall public opinion
see, not the allies but the enemies of France
in nations liberated from a past that was
hostile to us, and now called to enter up-
on a new existence guided by principles
which are our own and animated by the
sentiments of progress which form the
pacific link of society! A Europe more
strongly constituted and more homogene-
ous by better defined territorial division
is a guarantee for the peace of the Contin-
ent, and is neither a peril nor an injury to
our nation."{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< news/indent1 >}}•{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The Government comprehends annexa-
tions dictated by the absolute necessity of
uniting to a country populations having
the same manners and the same national
spirit. It can only desire those territorial
aggrandisements which would not affect
its powerful cohesion, but must always la-
bour for its moral and political aggrandise-
ment, using its influence on behalf of the
great interests of civilisation. Neverthe-
less, the results of the late war teach an
important lesson, and show the necessity
which exists for the defence of our terri-
tory, and for perfecting without delay our
military organisation. The nation will not
fail in this duty, which cannot be regard-
ed as a threat by any."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In conclusion, the circular considers the
political horison to be free from any threat-
ening contingencies, and expresses belief
in a lasting peace.{{< /news/text >}}

A Toronto telegram to the New York
papers, dated September 12, say:—
``The Hamilton Times,' 'Ottawa Post,'
'Montreal Herald,' and 'Toronto Globe'
urge that the whole American people
and government are responsible for the
war waged by the Fenians on Canada,
and that England must insist on its sup-
pression or de-clare war. The papers
discuss nothing but Fenianism. Brant-
ford is in great alarm, the people and
authorities believing that an advance
guard of Fenians has arrived there. The
town and vicinity are swarming with
strange characters, and the home-guard
has been ordered on duty. An excur-
sion party from London to Cleveland, on
Friday last, had to leave the latter place
suddenly on account of fearing an at-
tack from a Fenian mob. Several volun-
teer companies, from both Upper and
Lower Canada, are disbanding on account
of unpopular appointments and other
causes. The English Adjutant-General
M'Dougall has become very unpopular.{{< /news/text >}}

The Rebellion in Burmah.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
THAYETMIO, AUGUST 31.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}I am writing from our frontier Station
where I have been since the news of out-
break reached us, and as you may wish to
know how matters are going on I will give
you the general position of affairs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Rebel Princes of Ava who murdered
their uncle, the Heir Apparent to the
throne, two of their own brothers and
some of the Ministers, have evidently made
a miscalculation. The outbreak took
place on the 2nd of August, and since that
date they have been unable to create a
party. They got possession of the King's
only steamer, then at Mandelay, and came
down the river; stopping about forty
miles from the British frontier. From
the Towns on the banks of the river they
made exactions, and where refused they
burnt down. But the officials who were
in charge either withdrew into the interior,
or fled to British territory; there was no
fraternizing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Princess then commenced the re-as-
cent of the river, and having come within
sixty miles of the capital they have stopped
again. Unable to collect troops, entirely
restricted to the steamer, and shut out
from any coalition with the King or the
other Princes, they must give in. Either
they will be captured, or they will manage
to escape to British territory. Their
chance against the King seems hopeless.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Meanwhile the Padeing Prince (Mentha),
the son of the murdered Heir Apparent,
holds aloof. He went alone to that coun-
try where Rebel Princes have before gone
always to return in sufficient strength to
overpower the King. But it does not ap-
pear that he means to attack the King.
There have been some skirmishing between
his men and the King's, not far from the
capital, in which his party were worst'ed;
but he has made no vigorous attempt to
take Mandelay. He is said to be at heart
more angry against the Rebel Princes who
killed his father, than against the King.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All this delay is of course favourable to
the King. From the British frontier sixty
miles northward he has re-established his
authority, and he has from the beginning
securely held the capital, which is a walled
city, having several guns; it has been
considerably strengthened since the out-
break, and as far as one can judge there is
no risk of disaffection within. The pro-
bable result of the present outbreak is that
the Rebel Princes will be captured or will
fly, and the Padeing Mentha will submit
to the King, who has promised him favour.
The Thongzai Prince, the only adult son of
the King now with him in Mandelay, will
likely be made Heir Apparent; indeed it
is reported that he has already received
that position.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There was no good and sufficient cause
for the outbreak. There was manifestly
no preparation for the subsequent measures
that might be necessary, and unless the
murders were to satisfy personal re-
venge, it is hard to understand what
prompted the deed. It would be explain-
able on the theory that the King and all
the Princes had plotted the destruction of
the Heir Apparent, his brother and their
uncle. And it is just possible that what
happened was a blundering execution of
an unripe scheme. But it has to be con-
sidered that immediately after the out-
break, the King sent to the Padeing
Mentha offering him the position of his
father, including the all important post of
Heir Apparent. This the Padeing Mentha
thought it imprudent to accept, and the
King then called in his own son, the
Thongzai Prince. The future politics of
Ava, even when this disturbance is over,
promise to be troublous enough.{{< /news/text >}}

Another Glance.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The last Chow Piya, has put us in
receipt of papers from Europe to the
22nd and from America to the 6th of
Sept.; from India to the 11th, from
Burmah to the 16th, from Shanghae
to the 6th and Hongkong the 11th
ulto.; from Penang and Singapore to
the 25th and 31st respectively; and our
latest telegram from London is only
to the 10th of October.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When we consider that it requires
only a moment of time to flash a tele-
gram 3000 miles across the Atlantic,
we feel quite dissatisfied, nay even
vexed with the present state of the
Telegraphic lines from Europe to Cal-
cutta, which requires us to wait a
month for our telegrams. Since science
has so successfully removed the oceans
out of the way of telegraphing, it
should quickly annihilate all lesser
obstacles in this eastern hemisphere of
unbroken land communication. Most
earnestly do we look for the day, ex-
pecting it soon to break, when the elec-
tro-telegraph lines between Great Bri-
tain and her colonies in Asia will be
so improved and extended, that we in
Siam, too, can hear from our homes in
Europe and America every day. And
we rejoice to learn that the EASTERN
ASIA TELEGRAPH COMPANY which con-
template extending the British Indian
line from Maulmain down the Malay
peninsula to Singapore, touching at
Pinang and Malacca, and sending a
branch from Tavoy to Bangkok, 80
miles, is in a fair way of being com-
menced, and that it will not require
more than one year to complete the
work after having begun it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are informed, also, by the pros-
pectus of said Company, that the Ne-
therlands India government have al-
ready begun to stretch a line of tele-
graph wires through the island of
Sumatra, and will complete it before
the end of the year 1867, and that the
government will be glad to have it
united with the one in contemplation,
which can readily be done by a sub-
marine cable from Malacca. We ex-
pect to hear that the two Atlantic
Cables are waking up all parts of
our world to extraordinary efforts in
telegraphing. Even heathen govern-
ments are already being aroused by
them—-Siam taking the lead. The
Emperor of China has granted Euro-
peans the privilege of laying a sub-
marine line from Peking to Hong-
kong to touch at'all the intermediate
ports that shall be thought worthy of
having a branch. And such is the
importance of commercial and politi-
cal interests in China, that western
capitalists and governments cannot
rest until China is in lightening com-
munication with the western world.
And it cannot be long hence ere the
whole earth shall be as it were, one
speaking gallery{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The news from Europe is remark-
ably pacific. Though many news-pa-
per writers, both in France and Eng-
land, prognosticatesbeing close at hand
still greater political up-heavings in
that land than any that have as yet
taken place, we see but little reason to
fear such results Yet we are learning
more and more the uselessness of po-
litical prophecying in thistime of won-
ders, excepting so far as we keep
close to the spirit of prophecy as re-
corded in the word of God. By that
word we are authorized to expect that
"Babylon the great" is about to fall,
and that "in one hour her judgment
is to come." But what further commo-
tions that event will produce in Eu-
rope, none can tell.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We see from our London files that
England cannot rest quietly in her
aristocratic proclivities. She must
extend the elective franchise more and
more freely to her millions of
working classes. The Spirit of God
is stirring up the people to demand it,
and raising up illustrious leaders who
will carry them onward to the enjoy-
ment of it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The news from the U. S. is a
strange mixture of peace and great
political commotion The blacks who
were partially enfranchised by the
late civil war, are the innocent occasion
of it, as they were of the late war,
and as Israel was of the plagues in
Egypt. We believe God is with the
former as he was with the latter de-
manding that justice shall be dispen-
sed to them by the U. S. Government.
It is in vain for the government to
ery peace peace while they with hold
from the blacks equal enfranchise[?]ment
with the whites. God who has thus
far liberated them by the uplifted
hand of his power, is now, we think,
most distinctly calling upon the gov-
ernment to finish the work in right-
eousness. But the President, standing
at the helm of state, refuses to obey
the divine injunction, The Constitu-
tional amendment, passed by congress
with the view to do this justice to
the blacks, he is making desperate
efforts to strangle before it can be-
come a law of the land. The course
which he is taking to strengthen his
policy party is most extraordinary,
and without a precedent for undig-
nified deportment. Many of his
speeches made en route to Chicago
early in September, have deeply dis-
gusted and mortified all American
citizens who were not in sympathy
with the late rebellion. These were
uniformly uproarious in shouting his
praises. Nearly all others were either si-
lent in shame and grief, or responded to
his speeches with hisses. It pains us
to pen these lines, but we think it
duty as faithful recorders requires it
at our hands, and we hope that we
may thus lead some who have power
with God in this eastern world, to
pray more importunately for the U.
S. We think we see clearly the over-
ruling hand of God in all her present
commotions, and that He is by them
teaching her lessons of wisdom that
will ultimately lead her out of the
wilderness into a Canaan of prosperity.
Her forty years of trials and afflictions
and war with the slave power have
nearly expired.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The present king of Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
PHA CHAWN KLAU.
CHAPTER XII.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The different kingdoms of the
world may be likened to great do-
mains with tenants scattered here and
there, working to get a recompense,
that shall make a comfortable home
for themselves and families. The
ruler like the overseer, having a great
salary for his abilities in stimulating
labor, devising improvements, and
preventing disaster.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The problem is to see how much
production can be secured, how much
improvements made, what mode of
procedure will warrant the greatest
pay and secure the greatest benefits
from every stand-point. The subjects
must put confidence in the ruler, and
the ruler must be sure to win con-
fidence by superior foresight and un-
tiring watch care.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let us look at Siam in this view of
the subject. What are its capabilities
for production? It has no occasion
to blush and hang its head for its
meagerness. It can look up in the com-
pany of the most luxuriant countries
and look unabashed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Its resources to employ its people,
affording facilities to become rich
themselves while they are pouring
revenue into the public treasury, are
very abundant, ample for all the sub-
jects of the kingdom and affording
great inducements for emigration if
proper protection could be secured
from government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Look at the luxuriant valley of the
great rivers, yet but very partially im-
proved as a rice growing region. Look
at the banks of the broad stream
where might be cocoanuts enough to
supply all the east, with an oil that
has no equal, if it is properly cured.
Siamese coffee is quite equal to the
red Moka. It could raise pepper en-
ough for the world. And what shall
I say of its noble teak forests and rich
and varied rivers, and the facilities for
manufactories from the grass matting
that is now so extensively cultivated
to silk fabrics that are now partially
made and used and that might become
an article of extensive export? All
these resources speak decisively, come
and work and become rich and re-
spected.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Do you ask for cotton? It can be
grown in any quantities and the Chi-
namen know how to grow it success-
fully, and now do so to some extent
in northern Siam. Encourage them
to come and make that whole region
productive to its full extent. Do you
ask for raw silk? Siam already has
quite a little commerce in this article,
and this little might be indefinitely
increased. Stimulus and encourage-
ment will multiply the product many-
fold. And the raw material which is
now exported might just as well be
manufactured here. The women al-
ready spin and weave many silk fab-
rics, and all the women in the land,
the Malayas perhaps at their head,
would welcome steam machinery
which might make Siam export silk
and cotton goods instead of now large-
ly importing and exporting the raw
material. Siam is wonderful in in-
ternal resources. Really it needs very
little but what it can produce in its
own domains.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We need home protection and we
need emigration to employ success-
fully all the resources of the country.
Some of the resources can only be
successfully developed by the native
population, adapted to the climate
and adequate to meet its vicissitudes.
This is more particularly true in work-
ing the rich and varied mines of the
country. They must mostly be work-
ed by the natives who can endure the
heat, and bear the privations that they
must suffer when far from the bounds
of civilized life. We have a Califor-
nia in Siam. We only need enterprize
to give it a title to celebrity among
the nations. We also have lead, iron,
copper, and tin and all these mines
are partially worked. We only need
enterprise to make them extensively
productive and remunerative.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The revenue, as it is at present
managed, demoralizes the country,
takes away the stimulus to labor, de-
grades the people, and so depresses
them that the tendency is deteriora-
tive in almost every department of
business. I speak advisedly. I perhaps
ought to make an exception. The
import revenue has a salaried officer,
who is from the nation, who of all
people in the wide world delight in
equal rights and equal protection - an
American. It is a three per cent tax
on all the imports of the country, ex-
cept opium. We presume that this
tax is properly assessed and that the
people who import here have no right
to complain of the law, or resort to
subterfuges to evade it. If this of-
ficer be upright, straightforward, and
just, fulfilling the duties of his office,
without bribery or embezzlement, he
will show to native officials and the
government that honesty is the best
policy, even as a remunerator.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The government greatly err in the
manner they pay their officials, and
the sources they collect their revenue.
A large proportion of their revenue is
from sources demoralizing and des-
tructive to the people. What are
opium and ardent spirits, and the
multiplied forms of gambling, and
theatres doing, but destroying the
country by piecemeal? And how can
the king speak out reprovingly and
with power when he is receiving great
revenue from these sources. And how
shall I speak it. Let a black cloud
shut out the light and murmuringly
frown while I say men, the heaven or-
dained protectors of beings, flesh of
their flesh, pay a revenue for the
privilege of debasing, and the rulers
receive the gain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Revenue prevents excess says the
conservative. A fine would be a great-
er protection; and then instead of
sanctioning evils that are degrading
and destructive, would be a frown up-
on the intemperate and make them
fear and desist, and so lead up to
temperance, abstinence and laudable
industry and virtuous action.{{< /news/text >}}
</div>
{{< news/br >}}
<!-- Article: 1866-11-08_2_6 text -->
<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}And there is another habit connect-
ed with these objectionable revenues,
the farming out of the revenues. The
government receiving a stated sum
from the highest bidder, and the
farmer keeping the gain as the reward
of his own services. This induces a
great recklessness of public good, to
secure private interest. The farmer
wishes the people to buy, that he may
get gain. And the effort is an in-
crease of the evils that prostitute
humanity, instead of a gradual demi-
nation as would be the effect, if a
penalty, which always ought to ac-
company any act, that demoralizes
and injures the people of a nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There should be a judicious, efficient
well based government, encouraging
production, commerce and emigra-
tion, inciting the people to become
intelligent subjects, loving, learning,
and industry, and honoring and prac-
tising the right, and true in govern-
ment and religion. Live and let live
makes a nation thrive as well as a lit-
tle community. Oppression takes a-
way inducements to labor. The la-
borer is worthy of his hire, and if he
does not receive it he will not long
work.{{< /news/text >}}

For the Bangkok Recorder.
Anghin.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}“The best thing in this world is the
assurance of a better, and our more
immediate wants are food, raiment
and rest” says old Humphrey. Poor
old man. I can seem to see just in
what a barren district he must have
lived. How much digging and tugging
and toiling, to secure a potatoe patch.
And how his good old wife, picked
and carded and spun, sized, warped and
wove, bleached and cut and sewed
weary days, to get her good old man
a change of clean linen. And as for
sleep there was little of it to be had.
One of the three cardinal wants of the
present world, old Humphrey to the
contrary notwithstanding—for what
with patching old clothes and making
new ones, beside all the churning and
brewing and baking demanded in the
eating line, the old lady must have
been obliged to retire late and rise
early, and even while in bed have her
thoughts so full of her many cares, she
could secure but little quiet sleep.
Poor old people! no wonder eating,
sleeping, and clothing filled the entire
scope of old Humphrey’s vision.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To us of Anghin there is a new
order of being. Sleep do we? Yes
verily without one anxious care. And
the waves which lash the shore, make
for us a most soothing lullaby. And
what delicious sleep too! The cool
breeze from the open window comes
deliciously into our very faces as we
drink in full draughts of fresh air,
giving us health, vigor and new life
while tired nature seeks repose. No
fear of chills and colds. It is sea air,
and sea air is innocent of ill-doing.
Sleep certainly is an item of impor-
tance in Anghin life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Eating and clothes-wearing come in
for a small share of thought, and seem
of very little relative importance to
us who have so many higher enjoy-
ments!! O very sentimental you ex-
claim and take flights of imagination
at our expense! But what of your-
selves? “Are afraid of a little tossing
on old ocean which lays between us;
and so at evening drag yourselves
down to the river’s brink to get a
breath of pure fresh air for a few
moments saved from the toil of eating
and drinking and dressing to give you
an appetite for the next meager attempt
at the same business. Shame on you.
Come down here if you make a raft
of bamboos to float you here. You
need no great ceremony to accomplish
the feat. A river boat will bring you,
if you come inland at first, and keep
near shore as you come out into the
open sea. And once here you can
have it all your own way. And very
comfortable too.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Pray don’t transport all your house-
hold goods and all your wearing ap-
parel—Old Humphrey’s ideas to the
contrary notwithstanding—Eating and
dressing will be but a small part of
your business. Take things easy when
you first arrive. Give yourself up to
rest and sleep and that sort of elysium
pleasure which comes from commun-
ing with nature in her most natural
developements.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Old ocean is a dear old fellow when
you have him at arm’s length. Listen
to his oratory in his various modes.
The full moon is coursing along the
heavens. Queen of half the world!
Old ocean feels her influence and
waxes loudly eloquent. We walk be-
fore him, noticing the majesty and
might of every movement, and allow
ourselves to be influenced by him in
turn.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mean, narrow, contracted, inefficient,
shortsighted, shortlived, selfish influ-
ence! How contemptable and dispicable!
Be susceptible of being moved by ob-
jects in themselves worthy to stir
your whole being and arouse your
entire sympathies. And don’t be
afraid to speak out when you do feel.
Yes, old ocean, roll up your majestic
waves, from centre to circumference,
and as you are warmed into effort by
the queen who presides over you, ex-
pand yourself, seeking now this shore,
and now the one across the sea, and
as you go, swell your oratory as you
speak from the crested wave.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hear you say “I have to serve
the nations. Use me at will. I’ll bear
on my broad shoulders burdens to
every clime, nor weary of my toil till
time is ended. I will be the obedient
servant of all who may command me,
having no respect of persons. Does
wrong seem to come from my placid
bosom? Remember it is not I, but the
winds and storms which compel me for
the moment to lose my balance, and
lay aside my placid bearing, but even
they cannot take away my dignity,
but sometimes make me even more
majestic, powerful, and influential. I
am of a very susceptible nature, no-
thing stoical dwells with me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But leaving the majesty of my own
power, dwell for a moment upon the
home I make for countless myriads
of happy beings, independent dwellers
in my domain, and who at the same
time minister to the comfort of ten
thousand times ten thousand and
thousands of thousands, who think
that eating is one of three great wants
of the countless multitudes of human
beings. Eat eat eat nor fear a fu-
ture want. Old ocean will live on and
ever as now crown your table with
rich and varied bounties. O ye nar-
row minded, selfish, thoughtless, head-
less mortals, who seem to think all
earth made for your use. Watch the
open sea and learn to serve your fel-
low men on an expensive noble plan.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now by what magic ladder can I
bring you down, gentle reader, from
the sublime contemplations that ocean
has stirred to the selfish idea of mak-
ing the generous old fellow become
your humble servant. Raiment an
immediate want? you quite scout the
idea. Much of it is quite an incum-
brance. Your wish to walk out and
battle with the crested wave and like
the wrestlers of the Olympic games
you can do it best in the most simple
attire. Think of trailing dresses, sweep-
ing wide streets as the majestic wear-
er pursues her winding way. Nothing
seems to us just now more profoundly
ridiculous. Even the Bloomer dress
is quite too roomy. Let it be tight
and dis-encumbering and in graceful
movement free as the soaring bird.
You plunge amid the waves, now for-
ward, now backward, now hither and
thither, quite believing yourself re-
newed with the waves renewing in-
fluence.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Bathing certainly is one of the great
wants of life to us who have come to
the sea shore for recreation. And it
is certainly one of the most delightful
recreations in a hot country like Siam.
You need not go to Singapore, or Chi-
na, or England, or America to get
health. Come to Anghin and breathe
new life, get new inspiration, new
hopes and new impulses. You may
not get a great deal of eating, nor find
it much of a place to display fine dres-
ses. But believe me, there is a fine
house, delightfully situated for the
best view of sea scenery, and affording
the finest opportunity for sea breezes,
and sea bathing, and entire relaxation
from the thousand vexations of city
life. Come and see. And make up
your mind to adopt simple habits, and
be content with simple surroundings,
finding your comforts in nature's am-
ple stores for cultivated people.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}His Majesty the king returned from
Pitsannuloke on Wednesday the 7th
inst. It is reported that he visited
the royal temples in the old city of
Ayuthia on Monday, and distributed
the annual presents of yellow robes
and other goods to the Buddhist priests
in those monasteries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Officials who followed His Majesty,
report that the paddy fields at the
North are the most promising, that
though the water has already fal-
len 12 feet, it is still more than 40
feet deep in the river, and overflowing
the fields. It would hence appear that
steamboats may annually pass a long
way up this river in the months of Oc-
tober, November and December.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hear that one of the Siamese
custom officers, at one of the stations
up the Bangkok-yai canal, has been
quite recently prosecuted for taking
unlawful rates of taxes on boats
of merchandize coming in from the
country. It appeared in the trial that
he had been doing this six or eight
months, and that the whole amount of
his extortions was not less than twen-
ty catties, equal to 1600 Ticals. We
are informed that for all this he was
only sentenced to receive 50 lashes
without further imprisonment and
without making any restitution to any
party. Can it be possible that this is
a fair sample of the justice that is ad-
ministered by one of the most unligh-
tened courts of this city? We cannot
but hope to learn that there has been
a great mistake made in reporting this
case to us. But if not, then we feel
compelled to say that such scoundrels
have little to fear from any laws in
Siam, and they may revel in their ex-
tortions, and highway robbing, as their
backs only will have to smart a little
for it, and only that not oftener,
probably, than once in fifty times. We
have much reason for thinking that
this crime is very prevalent at the
many toll-stations on the thorough-
fares coming into this metropolis. In
our Siamese Recorder, we have re-
ported many complaints of such ex-
tortions.{{< /news/text >}}

quired after the Mayor-elect we have
heard substantially the same report—-
to wit, that the Governor of Korat is surely
coming when he can close up his
affairs in that distant province, and
that he will then become Mayor of this
city, and that a thorough one will be
be. Now this is certainly a very
strange state of our city government.
It strikes us that it is indicative more
of the shiftlessness and weakness of
old age, than of the thriftiness and
strength of vigorous manhood. What
would be thought of any of our great
western cities, should they fail thus to
supply the vacancy of a Mayor?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The late Lord Mayor was a very im-
portant spoke in the wheel of the Inter-
national Court, being, if we mistake
not, one of the triune lords who alone
composed the Court. One of the re-
maining two is quite infirm and can-
not afford much aid to it. The other,
though one of the most worthy Judge's
of whom we have any acquaintance in
Siam, is not clothed with half the pow-
er he needs to execute justice. Great
responsibilities and most onerous cares
are devolved upon him, but his hands
are tied, his feet fettered by the
abominable customs of respecting rank
in the administration of justice. Offen-
ders who have a high nobleman or
lord to whom they belong, can effec-
tually shield themselves under their
wings from arrest by the sheriffs of the
International Court. Take the follow-
ing for an illustration.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We once had a Siamese cook indebt-
ed to us for fifty tical. He was suspec-
ted of stealing jewels from a Siamese
woman in our employ, estimated at 80
ticals. We intimated to him our fears
that he was the thief. He most solemn-
ly averred that he was innocent. But
in the course of two or three days he
and his family fled from us at night,
leaving nothing but a few empty boxes.
In one of them was found the identical
cotton in which the jewels had been
kept by the owner. We heard of his
being seen daily, hanging about the re-
sidence of his sister, who was a chief wife
of a nobleman connected with a Prime
Minister. We immediately reported
the case to the International Judge, re-
questing him to arrest the man and
bring him to trial, promising that we
would furnish his officers with guides
to aid them. He undertook the case.
Those officers were out in search of
the man many days and even weeks,
as we were informed, but found him
not. And during all that time, we have
good reason to believe, he was still a-
bout the place, being seen occasionally
by some of our servants. At length it
was reported that the rascal had gone
to Legore his native place, and that it
would be useless to pursue him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now such cases are of common oc-
currance. The wing of some prin-
cipal chief shelters the culprit, and hence
they cannot be found. Is not this
an abominable state of our city gov-
ernment? We would beg that His
Majesty the king insist upon the ster-
nest justice being administered at the
International court if at no other. Let
the judges, on whom devolves the re-
sponsibility, be clothed with full pow-
er to arrest even in the palaces of the
highest princes and lords without any
improper cringing to their high dignity;
and withal let these magistrates be
paid well for the discharge of their
high and solemn responsibilities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In our last issue we barely threw
out the thought that there needs to be
several public avenues from the river
to the new street Charoong Kroong.
We beg to expand that thought a lit-
tle more at this time. That street is
so far in the rear of the residences of
the Europeans in that quarter of the
city, so far from the river, and so
destitute of any proper openings to it
by land, that strangers coming into
the city know not where to find it.
There are, it is true, some narrow and
tortuous foot paths leading to it, and
one of them passes through the Bap-
tist Mission premises, greatly to the
annoyance of the mission. We beg to
say that this state of that new street
is far from being honorable to the
character of the city which professes
to be the capital of Young Siam.
There should be at least four wide
avenues passing from the river direct-
ly to that street, and these furnished,
at the expense of the city government,
with suitable landings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It appears from the Singapore
Daily Straits Times that the trial of
the Master and Mate of the schooner
Eria for barratry has come to an
abortive issue from the failure of the
jury to agree on a verdict and the
case was remanded till the next ses-
sion three months hence. The Daily
Times says.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}During the Criminal Session which
has just closed, we have witnessed
the discharge of two juries, in most
important cases, without their arriving
at a verdict. The fact must cause very
serious reflection to those who are
concerned for the prompt administra-
tion of justice. Of the two trials that
have thus come to an abortive issue
one involved the alternations of life and
death, and the other, besides the consi-
derable commercial interests indirectly
said to be affected, placed two men in
jeopardy of a punishment only one
remove from death itself. The pris-
oners in both these cases are, innocent
or guilty, now subjected to three
months of the torture of suspen[?]-e
which, but for the miserable want of
accord in the jurors, would have been
spared them.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}THE last issue of the LONDON AND
CHINA EXPRESS contained an article on
the proceedings of the French in Siam,
and more especially on those connected
with a proposed canal across the Isth-
mus of Krah. Our readers are proba-
bly aware that this project has been for
some years before the British public,
having been agitated as far back as 1857,
and the Siamese Government in 1862
gave a concession for ten years to Mr.
D. K. Mason, who is now endeavoring
to get up a Company with the necessary
capital, and we have reason to believe,
with every prospect of success. The
French application is consequently rather
late in the day, and although we are told
that the Directors have taken temporary
offices in Paris, it can hardly be expected
that the Siamese Government will break
faith with Mr. Mason unless much more
substantial advantages are to be obtained
than it would appear are submitted in
the prospectus. We are informed that
on one point alone the demands of the
French Company are so excessive, as
compared with the English, that we are
not surprised at some hesitation on the
part of the Siamese, even if a prior en-
gagement had not been contracted; for
whereas the latter state “the land re-
quired for the railway will have a boun-
dary of one English statute mile in
breadth throughout,” the latter stipulate
for “twenty kilometers (12½ English
miles) of unoccupied ground on each
side of the canal in its full length” or
for a belt of twenty five miles broad ac-
ross an important part of the Siamese
territory. In other words, the Govern-
ment at Bangkok, are modestly asked to
appropriate the cession of about 1,100
square miles in a country said to abound
in Tin, coal and valuable woods, with a
soil of unrivalled fertility. For our part
we have always had our doubts as to the
utility of the Isthmus of Krah scheme,
and are prepared to advocate in prefer-
ence a railway from Rangoon to Bang-
kok, as affording greater advantages for
communication between India and China,
and greater facilities of construction than
the Burmah and West China route as
advocated by Mr.____ __________
but then our opinion may be considered
as influencod by the supposed injury the
railway or canal may inflict on the town
of Singapore. Be this as it may—-we,
meanwhile,fail to see the the advantage the
Siamese Government is to derive from
abandonment of Mr. Mason's project,
with its moderate stipulations, in order
to adopt a more ambitious scheme, which
entails the cession of a large portion of
territory without any compensating be-
nefit to that nation. It is immaterial by
which Company the project, whether
railway or canal, is carried through, so
long as the conditions, on which the ces-
sion is made, are such as to prevent all
attempts at monopoly or exclusiveness,
and do not concede to others advantages
which are not to be enjoyed by all. It
will, therefore, behoove the Siamese Gov-
ernment, before confirming the charter
of either of the schemes, to make such
stipulations as will protect the general
interests of all concerned, of itself, of
the promoters, but above all, of the pup-
lic.-—SINGAPORE DAILY TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A word with President
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Johnson.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Does Mr. Johnson know that by his
indecorous language and injudicious con-
duct he is seriously increasing the diffi-
culties under which the country already
staggers? If he does not, it would be
well if some judicious friend—-if he has
any such left-—would tell him this.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With this desire that the loyal represen-
tatives of the southern states shall be with-
out further delay admitted to their seats
in Congress, it is known that we, with a
considerable and most respectable part of
the Republican party, strongly sympa-
thize. But this result is to be brought
about by reasoning, by persuasion, by
proving to the country that such a course
is the wisest; it cannot be attained by the
course which Mr. Johnson has so unwisely
chosen to adopt and follow. It would be
well for him to know that he is very fast
making himself personally odious. The
loyal people of the northern states, those
who stood by the Union when it was at-
tacked by rebels, see with a dissatisfac-
tion and alarm which is no longer conceal-
ed, that the President whom their votes
elevated to his position surrounds him-
self, by his own choice apparently, with
men like Tom Florence, Garrett Davis,
Saulsbury and others who, like these,
during the war never concealed their
sympathies with treason. They see Mr.
Johnson, further, removing from office
men of ability, and of undoubted fidelity
to the Union, and putting in their places
not war democrats, nor Republicans who
agree with his views on the question of
representation, but copperheads, sym-
pathizers with treason, persons whose
course during the war made them forever
hateful to the loyal people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They have seen him but lately, in
Louisiana, violate his own often declared
policy in regard to the southern states,
and violate it in favor of boastful rebels,
and to the injury of men who were known
as Union men; and they ask why, if the
law is to be stretched, if what the Presi-
dent asserts to be the true policy is to be
violated, why is it only in the interest of
men who are notorious as haters of liberty
and Union? They have seen him pardon
many of the most flagrant traitors-—such
men as Mayor Monroe, men of a temper
which makes them bad citizens, and whom
it would certainly be more judicious
to leave unpardoned. Finally, they are
alarmed and hurt at the indecorous lang-
uage which Mr. Johnson uses towards
Congress; they are disgusted to hear him
on every occasion denouncing Congress,
among whose members are many men of
spotless honor and long tried loyalty, as
traitors, rebels, usurpers, "hanging on
the government." They hear him speak
of "a subsidized press," and they ask,
"Who subsidizes it, when Mr. Johnson
has all the patronage?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If all this only made him unpopular, it
would perhaps matter little. But it is does
and has done more than that. It has
aroused such a storm of indignation
through the country, it has so driven
people's blood to their heads, that they
no longer stop to reason, but include in
one strong condemnation not only Mr.
Johnson, but every measure and policy
which he favors. Affairs have come to
the pass, that the most effective argument
which can be brought before the people
against any public measure or policy, is
the simple statement that Mr. Johnson
wishes or supports it. No matter how
cogent the reasons, for instance, for the
admission of loyal southern representa-
tives to Congress, no matter how unwise
and untenable the grounds of opposition
to this measure, its opponents need only
point to Mr. Johnson as its chief advocate,
and the indignation of the public with
him suffices to condemn also the policy
which is so unfortunate as to have his
favor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His language and acts show not a wise,
temperate and conciliatory spirit, not a
desire to produce harmony, and to effect
his ends with the general concurrence of
the nation; they show a petulant spirit, a
harsh temper, whose inevitable effect,
when used towards intelligent people,
jealous of dictation from their public ser-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}vants, is to arouse a passionate feeling of
hostility and opposition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not only does the President thus give
strength to those who oppose the adminis-
sion of all the states to Congress; un-
scrupulous men on that side are but too
ready to take advantage of his mistakes
and ill-temper, to excite still more op-
position against the measures he favors.
One after another, we notice, Republi-
can journals which formerly supported
the admission of the states, have fallen
off, under the pressure of the general
indignation and passion. THE EVENING
POST is not accustomed to make such con-
cessions to unreasoning prejudice, and it
will continue now to urge what seems to
it the only sound and safe policy, just as
it did when it was denounced for oppos-
ing the legal-tender bill—-which is now
seen to be just as mischievous as we at
the time declared it to be; or when it
was again denounced for demanding the
removal of General McClellan-—which,
but a few months later, was seen by all
loyal men to be most necessary. But it
has a right to remonstrate when the course
of the chief supporter of a just and neces-
sary measure makes that measure hateful
to the people; when the great influence
of the Executive, which might and ought
to be wisely directed to unite all good
men, by judicious action, upon a wise
policy, only increases the opposition to
such a policy, and tends to unite the nation
against it.—-THE EVENING POST.{{< /news/text >}}

Showing him a Miracle.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Renan having said, in his "Life of
Jesus," that the proper way of proving the
reality of a miracle is to show one, a pam-
phleteer "shows" him one in a letter
"Upon the Establishment of the Christian
Religion," as follows:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}SIR—-Permit me to-day, to draw your
attention again to the establishment of the
Christian religion, a fact upon which we
naturally differ in opinion. Like you, I
have striven to identify its cause with the
mere forces of man. I have failed in my
endeavor. The supernatural, then, has
been the only conducting thread which
has helped me to escape from the labyrinth,
where I see you continually seeking to
rectify yourself, without ever doing it, and
condemned to escape therefrom only when
you shall have proved that there is nothing
miraculous in the establishment of Chris-
tianity. Pardon this little digression. I
go straight to the work. There is a reli-
gion called the Christian, whose founder
was Jesus, named the Christ. The reli-
gion, which has lasted eighteen centuries,
and which calls itself the natural develop-
ment of that Judaism which ascends near
to the cradle of the world, had the Apostles

Termination of the Rebellion.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}About four o’clock yesterday after-
noon, the Steamer ‘Yai-nan-tskyia’ arriv-
ed in Rangoon, having on board the two
Mengoon rebel princes and nearly two
hundred followers. It appears that this
vessel was making her way down the
river, when the King’s two steamers
were passing upwards. The rebels, it is
said, fired on the leading vessel, which
was the ‘Meahnant aykia,’ or ‘Star of
Burmah,’ hulling her with shot two or
three times, and from which it was sup-
posed she would sink. The two vessels
in company opened fire on the rebels
and killed and wounded some five or six
people. The fight lasted for nearly an
hour, when they parted, the King's
vessels ascending the river, the rebel
steamer descending. The latter vessel
came down to Thayetmyo, where the
princes met the Chief Commissioner and
obtained his permission to proceed to
Rangoon. A small party of Police was
placed on board the vessel, which left
Thayetmyo on Saturday last and arrived
here late yesterday afternoon.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Further particulars of the engagement
we shall hope to gather for our Saturday's
issue.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are happy therefore to chronicle
the fact of the termination of the rebel-
lion. The river is now open the whole
way from Rangoon to Mandalay. Trade
must revive immediately. Persons who
have been deterred from proceeding to
the Capital, owing to the disturbances,
can now proceed in perfect safety.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Padeing prince, who was reported
to have attacked the royal city is also
about making his submission to the king.
He will perhaps be forgiven, as he may
pretend that he was only fighting against
the rebels. Every thing therefore is in
the most promising condition for the
complete pacification of the whole of
Burman proper.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Meanwhile the two princes who have
come for refuge to this city, are to re-
ceive a little British hospitality. They
will, of course, by visited as objects of
natural curiosity, by many residents of
the station. There will be only one
drawback. The recollection of that
bloody head, which was paraded through
the king's palace on the morning of the
outbreak. That head was the head of
the late Heir Apparent to the throne of
Burmah and the Royal brother of His
present Majesty. That horrid deed, and
other bloody deeds were done by these
young princes. They have played a
bold game for a throne and have lost.
It is not at all likely however that the
king will make any demand for the sur-
render of these fugitive sons.-—RANGOON

Conservative and Radical
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
WASHINGTON, August 8, 1866.
To THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT:
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two modes of reconstructing the rebel
states are proposed. One by the President,
which insists that rebellion disqualifies no
state from an equal participation in the
government, and that members from all
the insurrectionary states have a right to
take their seats in Congress; and, lastly,
that no power can lawfully interfere with
the state governments, or for the Union,
except that which is invested in himself.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The other, by Congress, demands a
practical protection to all the citizens of
the United States, in all the territory
over which the banner of freedom waves,
to every natural right, and especially to
“life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness.” To secure that protection, the
act for the continuance of the Freedmen’s
Bureau and the Civil Rights act were
passed over the President’s veto, which
is a practical guaranty of the last propo-
sition. The first mode is called CONSER-
VATIVE, the other RADICAL. Let us see.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The practical working of the first pro-
posal is presented in the late massacre at
New Orleans. A rebel mayor is authoriz-
ed to disperse, by an organized force un-
der the rebel flag, the delegates of the
people of the state, elected under the
the proclamation of the governor of the
state, to revise the constitution of the
state, which is executed by the cold-
blooded butchery of at least one hun-
dred loyal men; the governor of the state
is deposed, and a rebel general placed in
authority, and a major-general of the
United States—-SHERIDAN-—ordered to
report to him by the President. Which
will the people favor? The Conservative,
or the Radical?—-N. Y. INDEPENDENT.{{< /news/text >}}

Commodore Vanderbilt.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, the Rail-
road Prince of New York and one of the
greatest capitalists of the country, is the
son of a farmer of Staten Island, at
which place Cornelius was born on the
27th of May, 1791. His father establish-
ed a ferry between the Island and New
York, and "The Commodore," as he is
familiarly styled, commenced life as a
deck hand. At the age of sixteen he
had accumulated enough by his industry
and economy to purchase a boat of his
own, and continued the life of a boatmen
until 1814, when he married and moved
to New York. During his boating career,
young Vanderbilt earned the best reputa-
tion for himself by his promptness and
decision. Whatever he promised to do
was done, and done well. He rendered
good service during the war of 1812,
carrying dispatches to the forts about the
harbor. Early in the fall of 1813, the
British fleet tried to force an entrance to
the port, and was repulsed by the forts
at Sandy Hook. The forts were howev-
er, much disabled, and is absolutely
necessary that they should be reinforced.
It was blowing a gale from the southwest,
with a heavy sea on, and no one could be
found who would venture the voyage.
At last Vanderbilt was applied to, and he
immediately guaranteed to land the of-
ficers, and he did, although the whole
party got pretty well soursed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}About 1817, Vanderbilt first turned
his attention to steam, which he saw was
destined to be the motive power on water.
In that year he entered the service of
Thomas Gibbons, proprietor of a line of
steamboats from Philadelphia to New
York. He remained in Mr. Gibbons'
employment for twelve years, when de-
clining some very tempting offers made
by his old employer, he started once
more on his own account.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Being now thoroughly acquainted with
the working of steam, he set zealously to
work, and, bringing all the energy and
perseverance to bear which had aided
him in his early days, he soon laid down
the foundation of a vast fortune. He
established a line of steamboats on the
Hudson, one on the Sound, and several
others. He had to contend against rich
corporations and strong monopolies, but
his energy and knowledge enabled him
to surmount them all. His plan was to
work popularly, that is to afford the trav-
elling public the greatest possible accom-
modation at the lowest price. His steam-
ers were all built under his own im-
mediate inspection, and were celebrat-
ed for speed and the elegant style of
outfit. His vessels are indeed, noted for
speed, and the Vanderbilt, built for the
Havre route in 1855-6, made the short-
est run to Europe on record.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In 1865, Vanderbilt sold all his steam-
ships and invested most of his capital
now grown to an enormous size, in rail-
road stock, of which he was already a
large holder. He owns an immense
quantity of city stock, and at one time
was reported to own almost all the stock
of the Harlem road.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Vanderbilt is a bluff, finelooking
old gentleman of about seventy, hale
and hearty and enjoying in the fall of his
life some of the good things of earth
which he has earned by a well-spent
spring-time. He lives in the city, and
owns a country seat, besides a house on
Staten Island. His fortune is immense,
estimated as high as ten millions.-—N. Y.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The African Lion.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This lion is very much afraid of any
thing that looks like a trap. This makes
it very difficult to catch him alive, or to
entrap him at all. But it gives people
the advantage of him in other ways.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}By making something that has the ap-
pearance of a trap, they are able to keep
lions off, on dark nights, when without it
there would be great danger ; and Mr.
Livingstone mentions some cases where
the lives of domestic animals, and even
men, were saved in this way.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One night, when the oxen were left
tied to the wagon, and a sheep tied to a
tree, two lions came up to within three
yards of them; but, seeing the ropes
that the animals were tied with, they
concluded that it wasn't safe to leap; and
the first thing that any of the party knew,
the lions were standing there roaring with
disappointment. At another time, one
of the party was sleeping on the ground,
between two natives. They had built a
fire at their feet, and had tied an ox to a
bush close by. All were thoroughly tired,
and lay sound asleep. Their fire had
burnt down, and was now almost out. A
lion, encouraged by the darkness, came
within an easy jump of the sleepers.
Gladly would he have feasted that night
on human flesh ; but there stood the ox,
haltered to a bush! The lion thought
himself too cunning to be caught in that
trap.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He was not quite satisfied, however,
to go without his supper. This he showed
by roaring at the top of his voice. When
the men roused up, he went off to a knoll
at a little distance, but out of gun-shot,
and "roared all night, and continued his
growling as the party moved off daylight
next morning."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"By accident, a horse belonging to an
English gentleman, ran away," says the
writer; "but was stopped by the bridle
catching a stump. Here he remained a
prisoner two days, and, when found, the
whole space around was marked by the
foot-prints of lions. They had evidently
been afraid to attack the haltered horse,
thinking that it might be a trap."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The most common way of hunting the
lion is with dogs and guns. When one is
surprised or over taken by the dogs, he
stands still, with his face to the enemy,
as if to say, "Come on, I'm ready for
you!" or moves off slowly, walking for-
ward, or side-ways, or backward, as the
case may be; only being careful to keep
his head toward the nearest dog, and his
eyes upon all the rest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The dogs know better than to attack
him in front, and he knows better than
to allow them to attack him in the rear,
if whirling, snarling, snapping, and strik-
ing can prevent it; so that, as a general
thing, there is no pitched battle between
the dogs and the lion, and no lives lost,
unless some young dog, or one that is a
new hand at the business, allows himself
to come within reach of the lion's teeth,
or his paw; in which case, as all the old
dogs know, death to him is certain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The lion, when thus stopped by the
dogs, is said be at bay. This is usually
the way matters stand when the hunters
come up. They then have a good op-
portunity to take deliberate aim—only
they must be careful not to kill a dog—
and the rifle-ball or balls, if necessary,
soon put an end to the exciting scene.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some of the native tribes have a sin-
gular way of killing the lion. There is a
kind of caterpillar, about half an inch
long, that they have found to be very
poisonous to the flesh. These they care-
fully gather and crush; then place the
slimy matter on their arrow-points, and
dry it in the sun.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now they are ready to attack a lion
whenever they can get the right kind of
a chance. They know that, when he has
made a full meal, he may be found at no
great distance, lying asleep; and then
they have a good opportunity to get the
advantage of him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two active men follow up his track,
so slily that he is not disturbed. They
approach to within a few feet of him.
One draws a bow, with all his might,
holding the point of the arrow close to
the lion's side; while the other leans to-
ward the sleeper, holding up a skin cloak
with both hands.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All is now ready; clang goes the bow-
string, and clap goes the skin cloak right
over the lion's head. He springs to his
feet, surprised and bewildered, and
leaps away, in the greatest fright. There
is no necessity for their following him;
for they know that he will soon die from
the effects of the poison.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When preparing the poison, they are
very careful not to get any of it into a
scratch or other sore place upon their
hands, and they clean their finger-nails
with the greatest care when done.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If any of the matter gets into a wound,
however small, "the agony is so great,
says Dr. L., "that the person cuts him-
self, calls for his mother's milk, as if he
were returned in idea to childhood again,
or flies from human habitations a raging
maniac."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The effects on the lion are equally
terrible; he is heard moaning in distress,
and becomes furious, biting and tearing
the ground in rage."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The tribes that take this plan of kill-
ing the lion are Bushmen, a very active
and bold people that live in the southern
part of Africa. I will tell you more about
them at another time. Lions are scarce
and very cowardly in their country; but
in some other parts, where the people
are more afraid of them, they are more
numerous, and bolder, and oftener heard
to roar.—-N. Y. INDEPENDENT.{{< /news/text >}}

Comical Scene in Church.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Sabbath last, in one of our prominent
broad street churches, the closeness of the
atmosphere produced an almost irresisti-
ble feeling of drowsiness among many of
the congregation. Of the number who
found it impossible to deny the drowsy god
was one of our most successful business
men, whose honest efforts to throw off the
somnific influence he was under were wit-
nessed by several lookers on. At last he
succumbed; his eyes shut and failed to
come open again, and his head began to
nod to this and that neighbor quite famil-
iarly. Presently the sleeper's head slowly
bent toward it owner's wife, and continued
to sag, sag, sag, in that direction, until a
delicate sprig on my lady's hat pointed
directly into the ear of the snoozing hus-
band.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One more lurch of the head on "that
line" would cause the tapering sprig to
enter that delicate organ, and several per-
sons in the gallery were giving breathless
attention to the scene, fully anticipating
an extraordinary denouement when the
connection between the ear and the sprig
should be effected. At last it came, the
heavy head made another sag wifeward a
full inch, the sprig passed into the ear as
nicely as if it had been pointed by roguish
hands, and penetrating to the inner and
most sensitive portion, tickled the nodding
gentleman so intensely that he drew up
his head with a jerk, and striking out with
his right hand before he was barely awake,
dealt his wife a blow full upon her new
bonnet, to the utter discomfiture of its
flowers and ribbons, and to the infinite
amusement of the lookers-on in the gal-
lery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But who can describe the look of
ineffable sheepishness that settled upon
the face of the late sleeper, when he be-
came fully conscious of the ridiculousness
of his position. Wife looked savage, in
evident inward contemplation of the dam-
aged bonnet, and both were seen hasten-
ing home after service by way of a back
street. We wouldn't have had the "Candle"
our hero received when he reached home.—
