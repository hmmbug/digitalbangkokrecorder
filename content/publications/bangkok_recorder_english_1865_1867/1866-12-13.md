The American Congress
Elections.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Unfortunately for the success of his
own policy, the President, quitting his
position as a moderator, descended to that
of a partisan, and, with a view to obtain a
national verdict in his favour, made a tour
of agitation, in the progress of which his
self-will became more conspicuous than
his sagacity as a statesman. He charac-
terised Congress as a “revolutionary body,”
and darkly hinted at overbearing its auth-
ority. This was too much for the law-abid-
ing people of the United States. What
might have been the result of the late
elections if Mr. Johnson had quietly allow-
ed them to turn on the merits of his plan
of reconstruction can only be conjectured,
but it was readily foreseen that his want
of self-restraint had so shaped the ques-
tion to be decided that it was impossible
he could win. And so it has turned out.
Strong as the last Congress was in opposi-
tion to his will, the next will be stronger.
He will not have a third of the votes in
either House in his favour. His power of
veto will cease to be of service to him. No
doubt, he will see the wisdom of accepting
the adverse decision of the nation, and
will conform his policy to it with as good
a grace as may be.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would savour of impertinence in us
to challenge the propriety of the verdict
which the people have thus solemnly given,
nor are we disposed to do so. We may be
permitted, however, to express our hope
that the South will acquiesce in this elec-
toral defeat as a final settlement of their
difference with the North. They cannot
reasonably indulge an expectation of re-
covering in the councils of the great Re-
public the ascendancy which they lost on
the battle-field. Difficult as it will doub-
tless be to re-fashion the structure of their
social system, it is perhaps the easiest of
the paths now open to them by which
they may regain their former prosperity.
That which is possible now may become
impossible hereafter. At any rate, and
whatever view they may take of their lot,
they can but waste their energies in per-
sisting to carry on a struggle with over-
whelming odds. They are summoned to
surrender nothing that is essential to their
own well-being. They will still retain all
the elements of true political indepen-
dence. Within the limits assigned by
justice and civil equality, they will still be
their own masters. Their relative place
and power in the Union will, after all, de-
pend chiefly upon themselves. Let us
trust that we have witnessed the last of
sectional contests, and that the stars and
stripes may hereafter float over one harm-
onious, thriving, and happy republic.-—LoN.

The Difference, in a Nut-shell
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The President insists that all that is
necessary for the rebel states to be entitled
to representation in Congress is that they
should send loyal men as Representatives.
Congress insists that the District which
sends the Representative shall also give
proof of loyalty as well. Else it is perti-
nently asked, what shall prevent the most
disloyal state from 'sending loyal repre-
sentatives for the sake of obtaining ad-
mission and then turning about and send-
ing open traitors as their successors?{{< /news/text >}}

tion, and it is one that reaches to the root

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following interesting letter from
the great Quaker poet, has been received
by the Secretary of the Republican State
Committee of Massachusetts. Let it be
set off against Mr. Beecher's purblind
views:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
"AMESBURY, 8th mo., 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}"DEAR SIR:—I regret that the state of
my health will not allow me the privilege
of accepting the invitation of the Repub-
lican State Committee of Massachusetts to
meet and welcome the southern loyalists
at Philadelphia on the third of next
month.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}" My heart is with those noble men, who
came up from the hot furnace of rebellion
without the smell of its infernal fire on
their garments. I would like to say to
these, and through them to the people of
the States that we yield to none in the de-
sire for the restoration of these States to
their place in Congress, in the speediest
manner consistent with the safety of the
Union—in other words, whenever the
rights of all their inhabitants are secured,
and the monstrous inequality of represen-
tation growing out of slavery has been so
adjusted that a rebel in South Carolina
shall not have double the power of a loyal
man in one of the Northern States.—Mas-
sachusetts cherishes no hatred toward the
South; no representative of hers has with-
held his vote from appropriations for its
benefit on sectional grounds; no Mas-
sachusetts citizen has hesitated to mini-
ster to the necessities of Southern cities
under the calamities of plague or fire; the
same hands that aided the hunted loyalists
of East Tennessee have been extended to
feed the starving rebels of Savannah. We
have no desires of revenge to gratify, and
where, in the nature of things, we cannot
wholly forget, we are ready to forgive as
we would be forgiven.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Trusting that it is not too late for my
place to be filled in the delegation, I am
very truly thy friend.{{< /news/text >}}

The Outlook.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is doubtful whether the pilgrim-
age of the President and his Premier
to the tomb of Douglas will prove
successful as an electioneering meas-
ure. The President's speeches are so
egotistical, vapid, repeated, and nu-
merous as to fall very flat. They are
more sickening than impressive. He
seems full of nothing but personal
vanities, boastful pretensions, and low
flings at radicals. His evident attempt
to appropriate to himself and his poli-
cy the huzzas of Grant and Farragut,
and the manifest wish to force those
heroes into some sort of an indorse-
ment of himself and his policy, do not
work in his favor, but the contrary.
He can not convince the people of the
North and West that he is on the Un-
ion platform, or is the same Andrew
Johnson that he was. He can never
have a congress to do his bidding.
Himself and his policy are failures.
The thunder of the radical majorities
will be heard at Washington, and the
threatened coup d'etat will never be
heard of after November. The Pres-
ident, it is believed, is too shrewd to
please the radicals so well as to at-
tempt such a French affair, and then
have to "walk Spanish."-—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr SANDFORD, United States Consul
here, has received more news with
regard to the "small vessel," via, that
brought by a junk which arrived here
last evening from the Corea, reporting
that while entering harbor the master
was warned by the crew of a junk
which he met, not to go up the River
as the natives were up in arms, having
destroyed a foreign vessel with all her
crew, thus apparently confirming the
report brought by the French Fleet.
The General Sherman left Chefoo on
the 9th August. Capt. Preston, the
owner of the vessel, was on board at
the time, and should the melancholy
news prove true, it is to be deeply
regretted that his wife is en route for
Shanghae. There were also on board
two gentlemen from Chefoo, namely
Mr Thomas, a linguist, and Mr Ho-
garth, and it is feared they have all
met the fate of the crew, on board the
schooner. The murder of the crew
of the General Sherman, is said to
have been ordered by the King. This
fact, taken in connection with the
execution of those who held com-
munication with the Emperor on the
occasion of her recent visit, would go
far to point to the Government as the
author of the persecution of the mis-
sionaries, in which they were promp-
ted, probably, by the usual hatred of
foreign intrusion.-—Ov. C. Mail.{{< /news/text >}}

Penang.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following are extracts from the
PENANG ARGUS, of October 26th:—
An awful tragedy was enacted on board
of the native brig FUTTER ISLAM of the
burden of 145 tons, when she was lying
off Trinket, one of the group of islands
which form the Nicobars. The FUTTEE
ISLAM left this for Rangoon in August
last, but was driven by stress of weath-
er to Acheen; where, after remaining for
a few days, she sailed for the Nicobars
and anchored off the island of Trinket
about a quarter of a mile from Pulo Nang-
kowri, a place notorious for the treach-
ery of its inhabitants, and the many ves-
sels that have from time to time been at-
tacked there. The teacherous natives ap-
peared friendly and brought cocoanuts
and poultry, which they bartered for
cloth, tobacco, knives and arrack. On
the fourth day, five boats came alongside
containing some thirty persons, and five
or six went on board and entered into a
friendly chat with the Nacodah, sitting
and smoking with him. After holding par-
ley for some time, one of them called out
to a man in one of the boats for fire, which
he brought up in a long thick bamboo.
After lighting his cigar, he hit the Na-
kodah on the head with the bamboo and
knocked him down. On this, the men,
who were quietly seated in the boats and
watching what was going on board of the
brig, rushed up with billets of firewood
and spears, clubbing and spearing the
crew who ran panic stricken in all direc-
tions. In the confusion, three men named
Sultan, store keeper, Shaik Doud, top-
man, and Pakier, cock, ran down the hold
and hid themselves behind wood and mats,
where they remained till the noise on deck
had subsided. When they emerged from
their place of concealment and went on
deck, it was getting dark and not a single
soul was on board nor a boat alongside.
There was much blood on deck, but the
bodies of the murdered men had been
thrown overboard by the murderers. The
survivers got the pin out of the shackle
of the chain, slipped it and put out to
sea, there being a little breeze at the time,
and arrived here on the 23rd instant,
eight days after the shocking tragedy was
enacted. The FUTTEH ISLAM had altogeth-
er 24 men on board including the Nacodah,
all of whom, excepting the three survivors,
were either killed or carried on shore by
the Nicabarians.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the chief events of the week has
been the organization of another Mahome-
dan secret society, in the quiet fishing
village of Sunghy Penang, by four of
the influential headmen living there.
About one hundred aud twenty of the
villagers have joined this Association;
some from compulsion, and others from
promise of assistance in time of difficulty.
As might be axpected the society has a
number of idlers and blustering ragamuf-
fins. who are engaged in enlisting mem-
bers threatening those who resist them
and preventing others from associating
and transacting business with persons who
refuse to join the fraternity. No rows have
yet occurred, but the quiet of the peac-
able portion of the people has been much
disturbed by the threstening attitude of
the society men. There are several com-
plaints by persons of being seriously
threatened and their servants forced to
strike work. A law to suppress these
dangerous secret societies is much wanted.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Rebellion in the Burmese Empire
has determined, and two the of Rebel
Princes have taken refuge at Rangoon
where they arrived on the 9th October in
the Burmese Steamer " Yan-kan-taykin,"
with about two hundred followers. The
GAZETTE says:—-" We are told that a
house is to be engaged at Cantonment for
these Princes, where they will be kept
guarded by a strong body of Police, as
it is more than probable that numerous
emissaries of the late War Prince would
soon make short work of them, if they
were left unprotected. What is to be done
with them eventually, we cannot at pre-
sent say."{{< /news/text >}}

Scientific Traveler.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}For several years an eminent German
Naturalist, by the name of Dr. Bastian
has been traveling in the East, after hav-
ing traveled in the West. He spent some
years on the West Coast of Africa in the
territories of Ashantee and Dahomey and
other tribes. Dr. Bastian is an enthusiastic
naturalist and traveler. An account of
his travels was published some years ago
in Germany. In 1861 he reached Rangoon
after having made a journey through the
North west provinces. From this place he
left for the Burmese capital where he re-
mained sometime in the palace by invita-
tion of the King. From Mandalay it was
his intention to proceed into Western Chi-
na and by that route to work his way a-
long to Pekin. In this hope, however he
was disappointed. The Panthees [?] residing
near the Chinese frontier would not allow
him to pass. Hence he had to return. From
the capital, he then crossed the country
and traveled down to Maulmain. From
that town, he proceeded to Siam, whence
he passed up the Cambodia river to inspect
the ruins of the old city of Cambodia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the request of the King of Siam we
believe he furnished a sketch of his travels
to the ruins of Cambodia, and this paper
has lately been published in the columns
of the "Bangkok Recorder." Many papers
which he contributed to different Scienti-
fic Societies both in England and Germany
have been published in the journals. Dr.
Bastian is now traveling in the Southern
part of China, and after visiting Pekin will
probably, push up the Amour river, and
thence through Asiatic Russia back over-
land to Germany. He is a man of iron
constitution, of indomitable perseverance
and of extreme simplicity of habits. He
adapts himself to the tastes of every race
through whose territory he passes. He car-
ries no supplies along with him, but de-
pends for food on the natives of the coun-
try where he is traveling. He is certainly
a very extraordinary man. He has been
through America, through Africa and is
slowly pushing along through Asia. When
his travels are over, he will settle down
probably at Leipsic and write a succession
of works giving his observations and
experience for the benefit of mankind.—

A government Notification.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our attention was this day called
by a friend to a government notifica-
tion posted on small boards and hung
up in many places on the new street
Charon Kroong. The purport of it
is,—that the king is displeased to find
so few of the building lots on that
new street occupied by good and res-
pectable buildings, and that after sev-
eral years of waiting upon their own-
ers he sees that the great majority of the
lots remain an entire waste. He says
that he has been at great expense in
making the street for the purpose of
having it open many eligible building
sites that should be so occupied as to
improve and beautify the city, and
that seeing the owners of the waste
lots are not likely to do it themselves,
he has determined upon adopting the
following plan to accomplish his ori-
ginal purpose, viz:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The owners of the unoccupied lots
shall have but a little more than one
year more of grace for improving
them. If at the beginning of the year
Marong (about March 1868) the lots
remain unoccupied by some suitable
buildings, their owners shall be oblig-
ed to sell them to the king at only the
established government prices, and
that the government will then proceed
to erect buildings upon them to rent
to the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This appears to us a very interes-
ting government document. It would
seem to have been placarded twelve
or fifteen days since, with the seal of
H. E. Chow Phya Kaiahome the Prime
Minister affixed to it. It is written
simply with a black pencil on coarse
Siamese paper. We wonder at H. E.
having so important a business tran-
saction executed so shabbily, and that
no notice of it has been furnished by
government for either the English or
Siamese paper.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first blush of the document
might strike one as being rather op-
pressive upon the owners of those va-
cant building lots; but on a little
thought it looses that appearance. The
ground for the street was originally
purchased by the government at pri-
ces which no owner had any good rea-
son to complain of, even though they
might appear to him rather cheap, be-
cause the street when made would
enhance much the value of all the
land on its borders. The king's ob-
ject was really to benefit the land-
lords on the street, while at the same
time he intended to improve the city
by a large increase of good houses
neatly arranged on either side of the
street.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But now the king discovers that the
owners of the lots have raised their
ideas so high as to their value, that
they refuse to sell them at such pri-
ces as will justify persons of but little
money in purchasing them. Thus is
his benevolent object being defeated,
and hence he now determines to arrest
the further progress of this defeat, and
take a course that will accomplish his
original design. He has made an out-
lay of but little less than a thousand
catties of silver for the object, and
paid the original owners of the land
which the street occupies all that it
was then worth. And moreover, by
making the street he has more than
quadrupled the value of the building
lots which remain in their possession,
which if they would sell at even this
enhanced value, could and would be
purchased quickly by the poorer clas-
ses and suitably occupied. But no—
These landlords must have much
greater prices paid for their lots, such
as none but monied men can pay.
Hence we think that it is quite right
that the king should resolve upon the
course he has We are glad to see
that he has taken up the matter in
good earnest, and will in all probabi-
lity accomplish it.{{< /news/text >}}

Lotus Gardens.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We understand that the pic-nic
given by the Prussian Consul and
lady on the 11th inst. was highly
gratifying to the guests, especially to
the ladies and juvenals, to whom the
monotony of Bangkok affords but rare
opportunities for such agreeable re-
creations. The morning was fine, the
air bracing, and a favorable tide all
conspiring, made the ride to His
Majesty's palace in the Lotus garden
exhilirating. The Lotus garden is
becoming quite a fashionable place of
resort, conducing much to the health
and pleasure of our community. It
is accessible from the river by four
large canals, all verging into the
large canal which connects the Chow
Phya river with the Bangpakong.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To those residing in the lower part of
the city the most direct route is
through the Klawng Koot-mai, a fine
large canal dug during the present
reign, forming a large semi-circle
around the city. It furnishes beau-
tiful locations for dwellings and is
now one of the great throughfares of
the city. It is generally crowded
with boats, often rendering the passage
to and fro very difficult. The same
is true of all the canals in and about
Bangkok, giving some idea of the im-
mense trade between the provinces
and the metropolis. Nor are there
wanting numerous specimens of an-
cient Siamese war boats lying in
docks almost lining some portions of
the way, now superseded by the
modern improvements of war steamers,
with which they stand in striking
contrast, and giving us some idea of
the great advance of the present over
former reigns.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In addition to those there are in the
upper canals, before mentioned, palaces
of princes, and residences of noblemen,
and a number of large and extensive
temples throughout the whole extent
to the Lotus gardens. Wat Saket,
popularly called the tower of Babel,
situated on one of these canals com-
mands one of the finest views of the
city. It is an immense pile of brick
designed as a tower, in connection
with a temple, but was left unfinished
because it was too heavy to be sup-
ported entire upon its foundation.
It has recently been so repaired as to
be easy and safe of ascent to any
who may have the curiosity to visit it,
and will well repay the effort by giv-
ing a bird's-eye view of the city.
This whole portion of the city has a
crowded population embracing, the
numerous nationalities all seeking a
livelihood in their various callings.
In the immediate vicinity of the gar-
dens, as you approach the palace, the
rice fields begin to show in the dis-
tance. The location of the Lotus
garden on this canal was wisely
chosen. The grounds are large and
in pretty good order, the walks are
good, and the whole place admirably
adapted for a pic-nic excursion, as
well as for its original design, as a
place of recreation for His Majesty,
in which he may spend a day or more
away from the cares and business of
the palace. The lot fronts on the
canal. Behind the building is an
artificial pond in which the Lotus
plants are grown, which constitutes
the garden proper. They are not in
blossom at this season of the year, and
boats pass over their beds with but
little sign of their existence. In the
midst of the pond is an artificial is-
land on which there is a new temple
in process of building, which when
finished may rank, in workmanship,
among the first class of temples in the
kingdom. There is a small canal lead-
ing from the main one by which the
garden and the temple is reached. The
paintings on the walls within are said
to be of rather a fine order, reflecting
credit on the artists by whom they
were executed. Any one who has
been at Wat Po will remember how
finely the temple walls are covered
with paintings, representing real and
imaginary beings and scenes. The
gardens, the island, and the temple
are all in full view of the palace build-
ings, with a broad, cheering view
over the rice fields, and the whole
together forms another one of the
many pleasant spots around Bangkok,
an occasional visit to which would
contribute to the health and cheerful-
ness of the citizens.{{< /news/text >}}

Shan Land-Sketches
HISTORY, LITERATURE RELIGION &c.
CHAPTER 11.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two o'clock in the morning, at the
full moon of February, we came to
anchor outside the bar, at the entrance
of the river, leading to the capital of
Shanland. The captain immediately
manned the cutter, and we set out for
the city, as it was smooth water in
the Gulf, early in the morning. If
we had waited for daylight, before we
could reach the river, the great waves
might make our little boat uncomfort-
able.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We reached the river just at break
of day, and a more gladsome scene I
never witnessed. The full moon set
upon the western horizon. The Sun
had just stepped forth from his bed
chamber, and Venus just above never
looked brighter. It seemed gala
day with the glad bowers. Cock-a-
doodle-doo sang in most joyous rounds,
the lords of the heneries along the
coast. All the feathered tribes were
awake and full of song. The myriads
of insects of every variety of tone and
character chimed in their little melody,
and even the fishes, seemed tuneful as
well, for some little shoals of them,
were giving us a merry tune, as they
seemed to cling to our boat and move
with us, as on the perfectly glassy
surface of the water we glided quietly
along. And the foliage too, how
luxurious! up and down and around, as
far as the eye could reach, not a tall
towering growth, but a thick young
growth of wood land, each tree seem-
ing to press on its neighbor, and per-
fectly loaded down with leaves—a rich
deep green without variety.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How full of life, was my spontane-
ous exclamation, as we came into the
river. I do not know that I can ex-
press more of Shaunland, in a few
words, than I did then. It is full of
life. The soil and the waters seem
so delight to bring forth, and indepen-
dent of man, is a land abounding in
varied gifts. The soil enriches itself,
with the flood tides with come every
year with the closing rains, and then
sends forth, in the forests even, palatable
fruits and vegetables. The wild deer
courses free in the woodlands, and
varied birds fine for food, and many
of them sweet-singers, are every-where
on the wing, seeking their food from
God. You can hardly turn up a spade
of mother earth without disturbing
myriads of her children. And fish,
sea fish, shell fish, have all seasons for
their own, and afford an inexhaustable
store for those who love what is
healthy and simple.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The longer I live in Shaunland, the
more I am impressed with its suscep-
tabilities for a great population. It is
a constant producer, and unlike most
countries, and most created things,
asks no day of rest or year of jubilee.
All seasons are adorned with fruits
and flowers and delicate buds and some-
times the same tree has them all at
once, and the great variety cannot but
afford some for every taste.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}No languor winter even comes here
enveloping the earth in a shroud, and
saying as plain as looks can speak—-
death-—death—-death, bears univer-
sal sway. No nipping frosts ever
steals stealthily, in autumn nights,
and blast the hopes of long labors and
careful watch care. Life seems to be
the watchword of prolific nature.
Live and revel in natures bounties,
heedless of future wants You need no
bee-like industry, to hoard for gloomy
winter; each season has enough.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And here the philosopher would
naturally stop to trace the effects of
so luxurious and lenient a climate.
The hardy Scotchman on rugged hills,
first battles with dame nature, fighting
hard to keep a foothold on his mother
earth, and wrenching from her by
dint of greatest energy and care and
forethought, enough to well supply
his passing wants. Up with the sun
he toils with thoughts all wide awake
to gain his bread, and as he seeks his
bread he gets his education too. For
education is but well to learn to think,
and plan, and meet the tasks of life. It
matters little how the work is done
or where, 'tis well done. And so
the Scotch are brave and enterprising
and if a little "near" 'tis wonderful
they hold so loosely what has given
anxious care to get.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The men of Yankeeland are taught
in a harder school, than those that
train young men for war and seamen's
life or patriotic toil. The soil has
been the best of teachers. Sit down
and smoke your pipe and play at
cards or dare frequent a public house
and drink the fiery beverage which
turns the brain awry, and want and
beggary, even death is sure to press
upon your path at once. No! no!
says rocky, hilly Yankee land, if you
would live a busy, earnest, eager life,
all full of plans, and turns, and projects
rare, must be your part. And so in
Yankeeland they never miss a means
to gain an honest end. And so her
sons where'er the hand of Providence
may lead the way, will find a means
to thrive.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What then—-Is a luxurious land a
curse? I said not that. But man is
moved by circumstances, and if his
wants give him no blows to urge him
on, he loves to lag behind and rest
in cooling shade and sleep away his
hours, or seek some haunt of mirth,
and away his listless, dreamless time in
play, or lulled in lap of luxury and
self indulgence, thinks of naught but
what will gratify wild passions unres-
trained by fear of God or man.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Wants we must have, to make us
think, and plan, and act. Wants for
ourselves, our fellow men, our country,
or a stimulus to glorify the Being we
were made to serve. The great chief
want is lust. We need a God to serve
whose days are filled with making
worlds and peopling them with living
men and things. Who makes it his
great end, to train those godlike made
for bliss in heaven. With a God like
this to serve, and imitate, and purpose
full awake to serve the human race,
the swift winged thought of man
would always soar and seek some
wished for good, to glorify the God
o'er all, or benefit some brother man
in need that has a life less easy than
his own.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}IRON BRIDGES.-—Two Iron Bridges
have already been set up in this city,
and we are glad to observe that two
others are going up. One of them is
to cross the new canal near the lower
Fort on the left bank of the Menam,
and the other to cross the old canal
near the city walls at the northern end
of the great Bazar. They are both
to be draw-bridges some 70 to 80 feet
in length by 12 or 15 in breadth. We
scarcely need say that the one near the
city wall will be a great improvement
upon the old bridge of but two nar-
row planks which none but men, goats
and dogs could walk, and which we
have seen full thirty one years with
an unbroken and perpetual line of hu-
man beings passing both ways upon it.{{< /news/text >}}

Aubaret, the French consul, has be-

4th Article of the Treaty of April
1856 relating to Cambodia, and has
demanded the removal of H. E. the
Prime Minister. If true, this is cer-
tainly a most extraordinary proceed-
ing for a consul. Would any minister
plenipotentiary in Europe dare to make
such a demand of any European gov-
ernment ? With all their high rank
and position we believe they would
not dare to venture to take such a
step, and if they did, their passports
would be handed over to them im-
mediately. We trust the Siamese
government will not yield to any such
demand, and, if the report is true, will
stand firm to their true dignity and
duty. We do not believe any gov-
ernment in Europe or America would
tolerate such proceedings in a consul.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}FIRE.—-An attempt appears to have
been made on the 10th inst. to burn
down the Chinese-land rice mills on the
Canal a little in the rear of the Harbor
Master’s residence. In the dead of
that night a Peon connected with the
Police force, standing on the bridge a
little way from the mills, saw a small
blaze of fire on the attap roof of one of
the mills, and instantly raised an alarm,
which called out a sufficient number
of persons to extinguish it in time to
save all damage. In doing so they found
that a lot of lucifer matches, had been
rolled up in many folds of Chinese
wrapping paper, and the paper ignit-
ed and thrown up on the roof, doubt-
less by some incendiary, expecting
the paper would burn slowly until he
could have time to escape notice and
then ignite the matches. He did in-
deed escape, but the matches had not
been reached by the burning paper be-
fore the plot was arrested. Had the
police man been a few minutes later,
the two or three rice mills, the most
combustible things possible, would have
been wrapped in flames, and the whole
neighborhood would doubtless have
been involved in the catastrophe. This
is another proof among very many of
the utility of a Police force. There
have been several such narrow escapes
from conflagration by the intervention
of police men, who were on the
watch.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}“The Ladies of the Bangkok Bazar

wholly resigning the comforts and pleas-

ly that they may help, comfort, and en-
courage with their presence their hus-
bands while engaged in the higher work
of teaching the far off Louians the
blessed truths of the Gospel, their
tired efforts shall be, half hopeful, half

devoted, to expressing our warm and

Sandwich Islands No. 8.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}HONOLULU is the capital of the
Hawaiian nation, and is situated on
the South western side of OAHU. The
harbor has the reputation of being
one of the best in the Pacific Ocean,
and is formed by a coral reef. The city
contains a population of about 12,000
souls, and has assumed quite the ap-
pearance of a European city in the
style of its houses, streets sidewalks, etc.
The palace of the king is in the city,
surrounded by a stone wall. The
building is a story and a half, but it
would seem not very imposing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are two native Protestant
churches and one Roman Catholic.
Besides these, there are also the Fort
street church, a seaman's chapel, and
an Episcopalian or “Reformed Cath-
olic church. Outside of the city,
within the Honolulu district, there are
a dozen or more houses for Protestant
worship and built by the natives, at a
cost, on an average, of six hundred dol-
lars each. Three of them are of stone
and the others generally of wood. The
first church in Honolulu is built of
coral blocks, with extensive galleries,
seats a large congregation, and has a
town clock in its tower.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The members of the second church,
numbering 2516, made out a regular
call to Rev. Mr. Parker at the time of
Dr. Anderson’s visit in 1863, promis-
ing him a salary of a thousand dol-
lars to be raised by themselves. His
ordination took place at that time, and
the services, as described by Dr. A.
must have been most interesting.
“The vast audience, its becoming
appearance, the interest, the attention,
the singing, every thing indicated an
established christianity.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two miles from the city is Oahu
COLLEGE, a charming situation com-
manding a grand view of the sea. "It
is a beautiful place, and the college
seems to be a gem of the Islands. Here
the children of the missionaries, male
and female, and other foreign youths,
and natives, speaking the English
language, and paying their expenses
may receive almost as effective an
education as was given by American
colleges in my early years." The school
was commenced in 1841 and the char-
ter obtained in 1853. The number of
pupils in 1863 was seventy nine.
    Dr. A. was present at the annual
examination in 1863, and says of it.
"The hall was filled with students,
teachers, and an intelligent audience.
The examination was admirably con-
ducted, and completely successful.
The President (Mills) examined in
geometry, meteorology, algebra, elem-
ents of criticism, and intellectual phil-
osophy; Prof. Alexander, in the Latin
Reader, Sophocles, Virgil, and ana-
lytical geometry; Mrs. Mills, in Chem-
istry, geology, botany, natural the-
ology, and English grammar; Miss
Coan, in history and rhetoric, while
the paintings and drawings executed
by her pupils were seen upon the
walls; and Mr. Bailey, in arithmetic
and geography, including the exhibi-
tion of neatly executed maps. The
commencement performances were on
Thursday evening, June 18th (1863)
in the great Stone Church of Honolu-
lu. The speakers acquitted themselves
well, and the singing by the pupils,
under a German professor, was of a
high order. Altogether the institution
appeared to be in a prosperous con-
dition, and I cannot help regarding it
as one of the most important elements
of safety and prosperity for the
Hawaiian nation."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a chapter towards the latter part
of his book Dr. A. writes more par-
ticularly on Schools and Literature
from which the following extracts are
made.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The Hawaiian language was so
far reduced to writing by the mis-
sionaries in 1822, that they com-
menced printing in January of that
year. Every syllable of the language
ends with a vowel; and all the sounds
of the language are expressed by five
vowels and seven consonants. To
give a proper expression to the names
of persons, places, and things in oth-
er countries, with which the Hawai-
ians need to become acquainted,
especially to Scripture names, nine
consonants have been added—b, d, f,
g, r, s, t, v, and z. The twelve let-
ters of the proper Hawaiian alphabet
are a, e, i, o, u, h, k, l, m, n, p, w.
It was this simple alphabet that so
soon made the ability to read almost
universal."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"There have been published in the
native language besides the Old and
New Testaments, more than two hun-
dred different works, and more than
two hundred million pages."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The classes of books, published
have been 1st Religions 21 kinds; 2nd
School books 38 kinds; 3d General
Science 7 kinds, generally large works
embracing Political economy, Com-
pend of general history, ancient His-
tory &c.; 4th Government, 4 kinds, as
statute laws, civil code, penal code
&c. and 5th Newspapers, 10.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The question will arise, How far
the Hawaiian people are able and
disposed to be profited by a litera-
ture in their native language. This
will be best answered by an extract
from a well considered article, which
was read by Judge Andrews before
the Hawaiian Evangelical Association
in June, 1863. His competence to
testify on the subject is seen in the
fact, that he is the author of the
Hawaiian Grammar mentioned above,
and also of a Dictionary of the Hawai-
ian Language, containing ten or
twelve thousand words . . . and
was the first principal of what is now
the Lahainaluna College."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"It will be remembered that at that
time (1828) and for several years after-
wards, no children were in the schools.
The schools were composed of adults,
chiefs and people, men and women.
Many who had passed the middle age
of life were proud to stand up in clas-
ses and read their palapalas. The
masses read, and continued to learn
to read, as fast as the missionaries
could get out books for them. The
first book was a Spelling-book; then
followed Thoughts of the chiefs. The
chiefs had not only learned to read,
but to write out their own thoughts.
The Sermon on the mount followed;
then the History of Joseph; then a
sequel to the Spelling-book, a small
Arithmetic etc. * * * * *{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Again, simultaneously with read-
ing, the people learned to write, just
as far as they could get the apparatus,
i. e. pon, or pencil, and paper, or slates
and pencils. * * * *It was often said,
-—and I never heard it disputed,
that every Hawaiian who could
procure a slate knew how to write.
"In February, 1832, a Hawaiian weekly
periodical (Lamer Hawaii), of four
quarto pages, was commenced at
Lahainaluna, one condition of which
was, that one full page of each number
was reserved for the original thoughts
of Hawaiians; and they filled it with
respectable newspaper matter. And a
Hawaiian periodical has been kept up
from that time to the present, no in-
considerable portion of which has been
furnished by Hawaiians themselves.
Hero then are readers and writers to
no small extent.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Another thing taught and learned,
and in a good degree understood in
native schools, is Arithmetic; and it
is of just the same value to Hawaiians,
so far as mental improvement is con-
cerned as arithmetic is in any other
language. * * * And the treatises that
have been prepared and printed and
studied, are not mere first books for
children, but such are studied in com-
mon and higher schools in the United
States and England.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Again in the higher schools of La-
hainaluna, Hilo and Waioh, neither
teachers nor scholars have stopped at
arithmetic, but have gone a step further
—-into algebra. And any one by ex-
amination, may be assured, not only
that the Hawaiian language is capable
of expressing the terms of that science,
but that Hawaiian minds are capable
of understanding its principles, and
solving its problems.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Again, Surveying has not only
been theoretically taught through the
medium of the Hawaiian language, but
carried out in practice for several years
past. No small part of the surveying
of the Islands, is now in the hands of
the Hawaiians who have learned it
entirely in their own language.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Geography next to Arithmetic, has
been a favorite study calculated to
enlarge their minds, excite their
curiosity, and probably has led some
to ship as seamen that they might see
foreign countries. And this has been
done in their own language.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Hitherto I have spoken only of the
intellectual improvement, or simply
the gain of knowledge. But the moral
and religious instruction which Hawai-
ians have gained through the medium
of their own language is, in my opin-
ion, of vastly greater importance. They
have received it in schools, from peri-
odicals, from tracts, from reading the
Bible, and from hearing the gospel
preached from Sabbath to Sabbath.
* * * * They have learned from the
Bible their relationship to God and to
one another, and the duties growing
out of that relationship. They have,
learned, —moreover, the plan of salva-
tion through the obedience, sufferings,
and death of the Son of God.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Besides the Bible they have read
many other moral and religious books,
as they have been prepared or trans-
lated for them; such as Wayland's
moral Philosophy, Gallaudet's treatise
in the soul, Baxter's Saint's Rest etc.
etc. Besides the moral and religious
lessons in the weekly publications.
The value of this kind of instruction
cannot be estimated in dollars and
cents. We may see some of its effects
in the morals of the people; the quiet-
ing of the war spirit for almost forty
years; the general adherence to a writ-
ten code of laws; the almost entire
cessation of the murderous spirit; the
adoption of the Sabbath instead of the
arbitrary tabas; the general safety
of foreign residents; the peaceful pos-
session of property; the liberty and
form of religious worship, etc, etc. All
this state of things is not easy to be
accounted for, except by means of the
moral and religious instruction con-
veyed to the masses, through their
own language, and primarily in native
schools".{{< /news/text >}}

Excerpts from Ruskin.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In his last volume Ruskin has, as usual,
many trenchant passages. Of the mo-
ney worshippers, he says:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"However, in every nation there are,
and must be a certain number of these
Fiend's servants, who have it principally
for the object of their lives to make money.
They are always, as I said, more or less
stupid, and cannot conceive of anything
else so nice as money. Stupidity is always
the basis of the Judas bargain. "We do
great injustice to Iscariot, in thinking him
wicked above all common wickedness. He
was only a common money-lover, and, like
all money-lovers, didn't understand Christ;
couldn't make out the worth of him, or the
meaning of him. He didn't want Him
to be killed. He was horror struck when
he found that Christ would be killed;
threw his money away instantly, and hang-
ed himself. How many of our present
money-seekers, think you, would have
the grace to hang themselves, whoever
was killed? But Judas was a common,
selfish, muddle-headed, pilfering fellow;
his hand always in the bag of the poor.
not caring for them. He didn't under-
stand Christ; yet believed in him, much
more than most of us do; had seen Him
do miracles, thought He was quite strong
enough to shift for himself, and he, Ju-
das, might as well make his own little by-
perquisites out of the affair. Christ would
come out of it well enough, and he have
his thirty pieces. Now, that is the money-
seeker's idea, all over the world. He
doesn't hate Christ, but can't understand
Him—doesn't care for Him—sees no good
in that benevolent business; makes his
own little job out of it at all events, come
what will. And thus, out of every mass
of men, you have a certain number of
bagmen—your 'fee-first' men, whose main
object is to make money. And they do
make it in all sorts of unfair ways, chiefly
by the weight and force of money itself,
or what is called the power of capital;
that is to say, the power which money,
once obtained, has over the labor of the
poor, so that the capitalist can take all
its produce to himself, except the labor-
er's food. That is the modern Judas'
way of 'carrying the bag,' and 'bearing
what is put therein.'—-Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

Almost Swearing.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As I was walking down street the oth-
er day, I met three little boys on the side-
walk playing marbles. I watched them
with some interest as I passed slowly by
them, they seemed so happy and interest-
ed in their game; when one of them ex-
claimed, "by George, that was a lucky hit,
wasn't it."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The second boy looked up in much sur-
prise at the words he used. "Why Char-
lie," said he, "you are a swearer." "No,
I a'n't," said Charlie; "that isn't swear-
ing."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Well, it's almost swearing, at any rate,
mother says so; and she tells me not to
use such words, for if I do, I shall say
bad words before I think of it."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That mother was right in telling her
son not to use such words. There are
many similar words and expressions which
boys are much in the habit of using; but
as that boy said, it is very easy to go from
these to something worse, and finally to
profane swearing. No Christian gentle-
man, and certainly no lady of refinement
ever says, "By George," or uses any
other similar expression. It adds no force
to what is said. It not only borders on
profanity, but shows a lack of true re-
finement. The best of all books says,
"Let your communications be, Yea, yea;
Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than
these cometh of evil." —CHILD'S PAPER.{{< /news/text >}}

How the Fox was Fooled.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A cock had just crowed upon his dung-
hill. A fox was watching him but dared
not approach very near for fear of frigh-
tening him, He therefore employed this
ruse:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}”My dear sir,” he said, “I can no long-
er resist my desire to tell you how much
pleasure you have given me. It is a long
time that I have been looking at you, and
you are, I must confess, the most per-
fect creature I ever beheld. But what
pleases me, above everything else, is your
voice. In my whole life, I never heard
one like it, except, perhaps, that of your
father. And it was remarkable in him
that he sang with his eyes shut.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}”I can do the same,” replied the cock,
and immediately he shut his eyes, spread
his wings, and was going to crow, when
the fox seized him and carried him off.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Happily for him, some shepherds who
were at a little distance, saw the robber
carrying off his prey, and let loose their
dogs upon him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The cock then used a little art in his
turn, and said to the robber, “Tell them
that I am one of your friends, and they
will let you go.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The fox, believing this, opened his
mouth to speak, and so let go his bird,
which immediately flew into a tree and
mocked him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}”Woe unto him who speaks when he
ought to be silent,” said the cock.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}”Woe unto him who shuts his eyes
when he ought to have them open!” ob-
served the fox.—-Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

Napoleon Happy.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The news by the Atlantic Cable contains
a most comforting assurance of the su-
preme satisfaction with which the Emperor,
of France regards the upshot of things in
Europe. "The French circular says that
the recent changes in Europe are favorable
to France, Prussia and Italy are drawn
nearer in ideas and interest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Austria has now no hostile intent. The
convention of Rome will be loyally carried
out. Navies of second-class powers as-
sure the liberty of the Baltic and the
Mediterranean." "Everything is lovely."
and not even Mr. Seward could be more
ecstatic in his assured optimism.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Happy man! Why should he not be de-
lighted? After brooding over his "Napo-
leonic ideas" for thirty years, until the
time has arrived for their biggest realiza-
tion, and after having invested his literary
reputation in support of the [.....]
Caesarism, which was to put his anticipal-
ed glory high on the pages of history, he
undertook the actual performance of his
destined part as the master of the situation
in Europe. He offered himself as the in-
fallible counsellor, the final arbiter, the
rightful divider of nationalities, to advise
how Germany ought to be rearranged,
be rearranged, to determine on what terms
Italy should obtain Venetia, and to recon-
struct the map of Europe; and to his sur-
prise he found that nobody listened to him
or heeded his counsels, or cared for his
expressed wishes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Parties with one consent minded their
own business, managed their own affairs,
and settled their own difficulties, precisely
as they would have done if there had been
no such ruler as Napoleon III., and no such
country in Europe as the empire of France.
Even the anxiety which ruled the Congress
of Vienna, to arrange Europe in such a man-
ner as to prevent the revival of Napoleon-
ism, is no longer apparent. Nobody fears
him, nobody cares for him. He may re-
main the monarch of France as long as the
French people deem it for their interest to
retain him, or he might be driven from pow-
er to-morrow; and Europe, in its march
toward international independence and
harmony, neither feel his presence nor
would regard his exit with anything ap-
proaching to a convulsive sensation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let him be pleased with all this, if he
will; it is all he can do. Let him be dis-
pleased, if that suits his humor, he cannot
help himself. The great bugbear which
seemed to darken the whole hemisphere
has dissolved into thin air. Europe breathes
freely. Nations will now govern themselves,
and strive to promote their own, and the
advancement of each other, by cultivating
the arts of peace. The Dragon of Wantley
has turned to a shepherd's dog, and wags
his tail with delight over the bone which
Europe leaves at his disposal.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}LAKAWN—-On a ramble to day in the
street Charon Kroong we noticed that
the king's convicts, who are daily call-
ed out to work on one of the iron bridg-
es, had all turned out to planeing betel
wood for posts. We inquired of a
friend what that had to do with the
bridge. His reply was-—that the posts
were not at all for the bridge, but for
a lakawn (theatrical) shed at the Brit-
ish Consulate. But, said we, how is
it that the British Consul can com-
mand the king's conviet's for his own
work? Why, said he, it is not the Con-
sul that does it, but the Siamese gov-
ernment who have ordered to have a
lakawn play at the British Consulate
next Sunday in honor of the officers
of the British man of war lately arri-
ved. Is it possible, thought we, that
such a desecration of the Lord's day
will be allowed “within the gates” of
that Consulate—of a Christian kingdom
—-and that too of the Protestant type!
May heaven forbid it. We hope there

Wreck Register
and Chart for 1865.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A FOREIGNER, looking at the wreck
chart of the British Isles, might not un-
naturally conceive that a very large pro-
portion of the ships that pass to and
from our ports every year were wrecked
on our shores. When, however, he came
to be informed that the number of
vessels that cleared outwards and entered
inwards last year alone, from the different
ports in the United Kingdom (without
counting vessels employed solely as pas-
senger-ships), was 409,255; that they
represented a tonnage of 65,231,034; and
that the value of their cargoes must be
estimated at not less than £500,000,000;
the said foreigner would probably be
much surprised after all to learn that not
one per cent. of this great multitude of
vessels was wrecked either in our narrow
seas or on our coasts. Such, neverthe-
less, was the case.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the carefully-compiled wreck
register of the Board of Trade we find
that the total number of wrecks and
casualties from all causes on the coasts
of the United Kingdom and the surround-
ing seas, reported in 1865, is 1656.
The number reported in 1864 was 1390.
The corrected annual average of the
eleven years from 1855 to 1865 inclusive
was 1372. It should, however, be men-
tioned that the wrecks in 1864 were be-
low the average of the preceding five
years, although they were above the cor-
rected average of the last ten years.
The number of ships lost or damaged in
the 1656 casualties reported in 1865 was
2012, representing a registered tonnage
of upwards of 377,000 tons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Of these 2012 ships 1690 are known
to have been ships belonging to Great
Britain and its dependencies, with Brit-
ish certificates of registry, and 238 to
have been foreign ships. Of the remain-
ing 84 ships the country and employ-
ment are unknown. Of the British ships
1198 were employed in the British coas-
ting trade, and 492 were employed in
the (over sea) foreign and home trade;
and of the foreign ships 11 were employ-
ed in the British coasting trade.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Of the total number of casualties
(1656) reported in 1865, 554 were col-
lisions and 1102 were casualties other
than collisions. Of these 1656 casualties
540 resulted in total losses and 1116 in
partial damage more or less serious. We
find that 470 total losses took place from
causes other than collisions; 245 only
were caused by stress of weather; 99
were caused by inattention, carelessness,
or neglect; 38 arose from defects in the
ship or in her equipments (and of these
38 no less than 30 appear to have found-
ered from unseaworthiness), and the
remainder from various other causes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a remarkable fact that, taking the
past seven years as our guide, we find
that casualties to comparatively new
ships continue to bear a very high pro-
portion to the whole number of disasters,
thus—908 casualties happened to nearly
new ships, and 1701 to ships from three
to seven years of age. Then there are
casualties to 1087 ships from seven to
fourteen years old, and 3477 from fifteen
to thirty years old. Then follow 1267
ships from thirty to fifteen years old.
Having passed the service of half a cen-
tury, we come to the really old ships
—-viz., 230 between fifty and sixty years
old, 102 from sixty to seventy, 48 from
seventy to eighty, 14 from eighty to
ninety to a hundred, and 4 one hundred
and one years and upwards.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As regards the loss of life, the returns
show that the number lost from ship-
wreck on or near the coast of the United
Kingdom in 1865 was 698. These lives
were lost in 164 ships: 124 of them were
laden vessels, 33 were vessels in ballast,
and in seven cases it is not known
whether the vessels were laden or light:
131 of those ships were entirely lost, and
33 sustained partial on board vessels in
collisions, and 335 in vessels that were
stranded or cast ashore. The remaining
number, 35, were lost from various
causes, such as being washed overboard
in heavy seas, by explosions, &c. The
loss of life in 1864 was 516, which was
less than the number in any year since
1855. In that year (1855) the National
Lifeboat Institution began to take most
active steps to provide our coasts with
life-boats, having, during the previous
thirty years, struggled hard for support
to carry on its great and national work
on our shores: but in that year the late
Captain Hamilton Fitzgerald, R. N., left
the society the magnificent legacy of
£10,000. Its committee most wisely and
promptly decided to spend the whole of
the money in placing new life-boats on
the coast. Since that period the insti-
tution has contributed to the saving of
5758 lives from shipwrecks. How many
of these persons, in addition to their
wives, children, and other relations, have
reason this day to bless the name of this
and many other benefactors who have
given the cost of life-boats, and who
have thus aided to accomplish such a
large amount of solid, palpable good
work!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The greatest loss of life during the
seven years ending in 1865 occurred in
the Irish Sea, which is one of our prin-
cipal highways to and from America.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Amidst this desolation and havoc it is
very satisfactory to find that the means
of saving life from shipwreck on our
coast have made, and are making, the
most encouraging progress. There are
now nearly 200 life-boat stations on our
shores, and nearly the whole of them be-
long to the National Life-boat Insti-
tution, whose activity and usefulness
have commanded, not only the admira-
tion of the British people and Parliament,
but also that of nearly every maritime
Power throughout the world. Indeed,
it is a remarkable fact that during the
past few years kindred institutions have
been established on the coasts of many
of these nations, while at one of our
thriving colonies in the antipodes, it is
reported to the institution, they have
built self-righting life-boats equal to
those of the mother country.{{< /news/text >}}

249 life-saving rocket-apparatus stations,
which are worked by that valuable body

President Lincoln's Policy.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}So much is recklessly said about Pres-
ident Lincoln's policy, that it is profita-
ble to examine its nature, once in a while,
to see how utterly at variance with it is
the so-called "policy" of President
Johnson. We publish an extract from
a letter of President Lincoln to the la-
mented GENERAL Wadsworth, just before
the latter was killed at Spottsylvania,Pres-
ident Lincoln said.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You desire to know, in the event of
our success in the field, the same being
followed by a loyal, cheerful submission
on the part of the South, if universal
amnesty should be accompanied with
universal suffrage. If our success shall
be realized, followed by such desired
result, I cannot see, if universal amnesty
is granted, under the circumstances, I
can avoid exacting in return universal
suffrage on the basis of intelligence and
military service. How to better the
condition of the colored race has been a
study which has attracted my serious and
careful attention. Hence, I think I am
clear and decided as to what course I
shall pursue in the premises—regarding
it a religious duty, as the Nation's guar-
dian of those people, who have so heroi-
cally vindicated their manhood on the bat-
tle-field where, in assisting to save the life
of the Republic they have demonstrated
in their blood their right to the ballot,
which is the humane protection of the flag
they have so fearlessly defended.—L.C.N.{{< /news/text >}}

Mr. Beecher's Letter.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}I am not discouraged at the failure to
do the good I meant, at the misapprehen-
sion of my church, nor the severity of
former friends. Just now those angry
voices come to me as rude winds roar
through the trees. As soon as my health
is again restored, I shall go right on in
the very course I have hitherto pursued.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Who will follow or accompany it is for
others to decide. I shall labor for the
education of the whole people; for the
enfranchisement of men without regard
to class, caste, or color; for full develop-
ment among all nations or the liberty
wherewith Christ makes men free. In
doing this I will cheerfully work with par-
ties, any and all men that seek the same
glorious ends. But I will not become a
partisan. I will reserve my right to differ
and dissent, and respect the same right
in others. Seeking others, full manhood
and true personal liberty, I do not mean
to forfeit my own.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Better days are coming. These throes
of our day are labor-pains. God will bring
forth ere long great blessings. In some
moments which it pleases God to give me,
I think I discern arising beyond the pre-
sent troubles, and over the other side of
this abyss in which the nation wallows,
that fair form of Liberty—God's dear
child—whose whole beauty was never yet
disclosed. I know her solemn face. That
she is divine, I know by her girdle of pur-
ity, by her sceptre of justice, and by that
atmosphere of love that, issuing from her
as light from a star, moves with her, more
royal than a king's apparel. In this, too,
I know her divinity, that she shall bless
both friends and enemies, and yield the
fullest fruition of liberty to those who
would have slain her; as, one, her Mas-
ter gave His life for the salvation of those
who slew him.{{< /news/text >}}

The "Lubra" Piracy.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The public will be glad to learn that
Mrs Howes, the widow of Capt. Howes,
who was so foully murdered on board the
LUBRA, on Monday afternoon identified
one of the scoundrels who was most ac-
tive in that dreadful act of piracy and mur-
der.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mrs Howes picked him out from a
number of prisoners who were paraded
in the Gaol for the purpose of inspection
by her. We understand that her iden-
tification of the fellow is complete, and
that it justifies the suspicions that had
previously fallen upon him. It will be re-
membered that when Captain Howes was
deliberately shot, his wife was by his side
with her two children; one was an infant,
nearly four months old—-it died Monday
morning. Much sympathy is felt for Mrs
Howes in her very painful position.—-O.

Butler's Speech.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We cannot report the speech and do
it any justice.-—It was as he promised in
beginning, didactic, but the Butlerian
blade would flash out now and then in
some keen turn so characteristic of the
man; the same cutting wit that make the
General's field orders as spicy reading as
Punch. Briefly reviewing the history of
events that led to the war and defending
the consistency of his own record by a
clever absurdity in distinguishing be-
tween the duties of a man and a citizen,
he gave a clear review of the policy of Con-
gress and a most convincing defense of its
position. We do not question that most
of the audience went away with a clearer
reason for the faith that was in them than
they had before. Mr. Johnson was treated
to sundry sharp thrusts, and the speech
was not without passages of high elo-
quence. The story of the charge of the
colored troops on New Market Heights,
just two years before to a day-of which
the Fifth Regiment, led by Gen. Shurt-
leff, was one—stilled the audience to a
quiet only equalled by the outbursts of
applause that followed it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With his drooping eye-lid, twisting of
the mouth, short neck, shambling gait
and hesitancy of speech, the General is
the impersonation of awkwardness, but
his earnestness and pithiness of expres-
sion cover all these shortcomings and tell
wonderfully on an audience. We are not
admirers of his military or commercial
record but we should expect to go far to
find any one with a sounder position or
manlier arguments on the great issues of
the hour.-—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}
