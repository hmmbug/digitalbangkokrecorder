Chinese Summary.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Since the date of the last report the
pirates have been growing more and
more enterprising. It is not too much
to say that a vessel of small size can
scarcely leave Hongkong by the wind-
ward passage without falling a victim
to the predatory junks, which infest
the creeks and hidden bays of the in-
tricate coast. If she be a very fast
sailer and can run into the wind, she
may escape; if she be heavily armed
and filled with men, she may beat off
any junks which attack her, though
the pirates have now been rendered
daring by their success and continual-
ly board ships under fire. If they once
get near enough to throw stink pots,
further resistance on the part of the
vessel attacked seems useless. On the
1st a piratical attempt was made at
Aberdeen (on the south side of the is-
land of Hongkong,) but the buccaneers
do not seem to have had such good
information as usual, and boarded some
worthless native boats. H. M. S. Ad-
venture was in the bay and succeeded
in making a few prisoners. On the
night of the 2nd a very daring attack
was made on a water boat belonging
to Messrs. LANE, CRAWFORD & Co.
lying within the harbor limits, off the
new Mint. The pirates came on board
stealthily, battened down the crew and
hoped to be altogether unmolested,
but the master, although a prisoner in
his cabin, contrived to make so much
noise that he roused the attention of
the men on board a neighbouring
water boat, who came to his assistance
and fought the pirates hand to hand,
obtaining the victory in the end after
a severe struggle. Five bodies have
since been washed ashore, and it is
supposed that they are bodies of pir-
ates, engaged in this enterprise who
were killed in the fight. On the 5th
the Nuevo Lepanto a Spanish brig
left Hongkong for Macao. In the ev-
ening she was attacked by two pirates
junks, near Lantao, and though the
Captain tried to keep them off by his
fire, they ran him on board, and threw
stink pots. Officers and crew had to
beat a precipitate retreat in their boats.
As a general rule the pirates content
themselves with ransacking a ship.
They then leave her to her original
owners, but in this case, they set sail,
and carried off the prize altogether.
Her legitimate crew returned to Hong-
kong in the boats. Next morning a
Hamburg brig came in and reported
having seen the Nuevo Lepanto cru-
ising about outside with the Spanish
flag still flying. A Spanish war steam-
er then went in search of her, found
her and brought her in, the pirates
deserving their capture at the first signs
of danger. On the 10th, the schooner
Chin-chin was beating out of the Ly-
ee-moon when she was attacked and
captured in the usual way. In this
case the pirates left the vessel as soon
as they had plundered her, and her
crew, who had taken refuge meanwhile
in the foretop, brought her back to
harbor. The details of the piratical
successes become uninteresting from
their monotony. It seems to be re-
cognised as an inevitable decree of
providence, that almost all small ves-
sels leaving Hongkong should be rob-
bed, if they are worth robbing, and
unprovided with a battery of Arm-
strong guns. Meanwhile the gunboats
make captures now and then, but fail
to reduce the evil to any appreciable
extent. On the 12th the g. b. Opos-
sum went into Macao reporting that
she had destroyed a fleet of fifteen
piratical junks. It does not appear,
however, that she made any prisoners,
and the junks will no doubt be easily
replaced. Piracy in these waters is
too remunerative to be neglected for
want of capital, and it is commonly
supposed that without going away from
Hongkong, it would be possible to
find the money for replacing any
number of vessels which the British
gunboats may destroy. At present,
the gunboats, even when they capture
men, do not know what to do with
them. The local mandarins, if given
up to them, either torture or let them
go, being governed entirely by the sol-
vency of the pirates and their friends.
If they are brought to Hongkong, na-
tive traders here engage counsel on
their behalf, every advantage is taken
of the obscurity which must necessarily
hang over the evidence of their guilt
(as they are seldom caught in fla-
grante delicto) and nine times out of
ten they escape and resume operations
in triumph.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the North there have been
exciting accounts of rebel movements
and European measures for defence.
At Hankow, especially, there has been
great apprehension. On the 23rd of
January, a meeting was held under
the presidency of Mr. Medhurst the
Consul, at which it was resolved to
form a volunteer artillery corps. The
foreign community does not number
200, and of course in the event of a
serious attack by the Nienfei, there
would not have been much chance for
the settlement, although with an ef-
ficient garrison, it would be impregna-
ble. The Chinese have built a wall
which embraces it completely, touch-
ing the river at both ends. There is
a ditch fifty feet wide, a vast embank-
ment faced with granite, but unfortu-
nately no troops on which the slight-
est reliance could be placed. The
greatest danger in which the commun-
ity stood, was from the revolted sold-
iers of the Imperial Army. A large
body of these men, 6,000 strong (dri-
ven to rebellion by want, their pay
being eighteen months in arrears,) rose
and captured a place called Sungpoo,
about 80 miles from Hankow. They
afterwards formed a junction with the
Nienfei, and took the towns called
Wang-chow and Wang-po, respectively
50 and 30 miles from Hankow. De-
tachments began to scour the country
in all directions burning villages and
plundering the inhabitants. The po-
pulation flocked to Hankow, and al-
though when the last accounts left that
place, it was said that the panic was
subsiding, refugees continued to pour
into the town.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The census returns of Hongkong
made up to the 31st of December, 1865,
have been published in the Govern-
ment Gazette. It appears that the
population of the island is 125,504; of
these 2,084 are Europeans and Amer-
ican (1,142 men, 467 women and the
rest children). "Goa, Manila, Indian
and others of mixed breed" number
1,645. Details of the census will be
found in another page Trade Report.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}(From the "Hankow Times" of Feb-
ruary 3rd.){{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Hankow is actually in a state of
siege, the wall is in its entire length
feebly manned, tents and flags are seen
at uniform distances along it, and
throughout all hours of the day and
night the sound of cannon is heard
booming through the air. The gates
are shut, and the refugees from the
country flock in for protection by a
narrow space on the extreme edge of
the river bank between barricades
formed of sandstone hastily thrown up,
whilst a perfect exodus of the natives
of the town itself took place in the
middle of the week. Such as they
are, the defences of Hankow are com-
plete. Against an unarmed force, as the
Nienfei are known to be, they may
avail some-what, if the soldiers on the
wall can be kept in face of the enemy
when it arrives. Against any deter-
mined attack by armed troops, and
those even Chinese, the defence af-
forded by the wall and the troops on
it is simply ridiculous. From all
Chinese sources, we must infer that
the hordes of Nienfei are countless in
number.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The jugglery of Spiritualism.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Well meaning persons have some-
times been perplexed by the marvels
wrought by the mountebank professors
of spiritualism. It would be good for
such folks to consider the revelations
made in the case of one Dr. Colches-
ter, who was sued by the Collector of
Internal Revenue, at Rochester, N. Y.,
because he had refused to take out li-
cense as a juggler. The case was tried
in the U. S. District Court, and able
counsel contested it on both sides for
two days, so that the investigation was
thorough and exhaustive. No better
subject could have been selected than
this Colchester. He was published as
the chief among the mediums: such
men as John W. Forney, members of
Congress, lawyers, and doctors, men
of national reputation for wisdom and
shrewdness, certified that he excelled
all others in the wonderful feats that
he performed, and that there was no
possible way of accounting for them,
except by ascribing them to the spirits.
He would do all that tipping, rapping,
writing, speaking, music-playing me-
diums could do-—do all that the Da-
venports pretended to do, and much
more. Many smart, keen men had
tried to detect the deceiver, but failed,
and all seemed dumbfounded by the
mysterious performer. He would an-
swer questions handed him in sealed
envelopes, without opening them, pro-
cure messages from departed friends,
and, most wonderful of all, the names
of the departed would appear upon his
arm in blood-red characters.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What now was the result when these
extraordinary pretensions came to be
sifted in a court of law? It appears
that professional jugglers were sum-
moned for the prosecution, and they
testified that these were tricks of jug-
glery with which they were familiar;
that they could do all that Colchester
could, by sleight-of-hand; and, more-
over, two of them testified that Col-
chester had proposed to enter into
partnership with them, and go in for
a large business in spiritual manifesta-
tion, and make piles of money, not pre-
tending to deny that the whole thing
was a deception and fraud, but prefer-
ring to work under the guise of spir-
itualism, because that took better a-
mong the people than jugglery, and
consequently was more profitable. It
was proved that Colchester opened the
envelopes and read the questions which
he answered by a peculiar sleight-of-
hand; that he wrote the blood-red
letters on his arm by a process known
to jugglers, and did all his marvelous
feats by similar acts which it was near-
ly impossible for the uninitiated to de-
tect.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The investigation was very interest-
ing, as it opened up a broad field of
deceit and marvelous fraud upon the
credulity of the people, of which very
few even have a suspicion. These
tricks are so neatly performed that
the sharpest observer is likely to be
deceived. The testimony in this case
lifted the vail, and it took the jury
only ten minutes to bring in a verdict
that Colchester was a juggler, and ev-
ery candid man who heard the testi-
mony said that the decision was just.
But the dupes of spiritualism denoun-
ced it as persecution of their religion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Buffalo Advocate, in comment-
ing on the verdict, says: "But even
this gives to the deviltry practised by
the leading spiritualists we have known,
by far too good a character. Jugglery
need not necessarily damn souls, while
spiritualism has led thousands to ruin
and perdition. Deluded men and wo-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}men by multitudes, are easily entrap-
ped by Satan at his will."—{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
End of a Gambler.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A correspondent of the Portsmouth
Journal gives the following account
of one of the many victims of the gam-
ing table:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Of the many evil influences in-
cident to fallen humanity, the passion
for gaming may be ranked among the
foremost. For the drunkard, even in
the worst stages of that degrading vice,
there is hope; but there is none for
the victim to the fascinations of the
gaming table when once they have
seized him in their iron grasp. One
of the worst instances of this nature,
in final results, that has ever come to
my personal knowledge, occurred in
this vicinity in the case of a physician,
the son of a most worthy clergyman,
recently deceased. After the usual strug-
gles that most of the profession experi-
ence, he succeeded in obtaining,
through the aid of kind friends, a
practice sufficiently remunerative, be-
sides affording all the comforts of life,
to enable him and his little family to
make the respectable appearance in the
community requisite to continued suc-
cess in his calling. Notwithstanding
this evident prosperity, however, which
had been greatly advanced by the
generous acknowledgment on the part
of some of the older and more experienc-
ed physicians of their confidence in
his ability, there was a mystery about
him that those who knew him most
intimately were unable to fathom.
While living in an economical manner,
and pressing the payment of his bills
on the plea that his necessities required
it, he did not diminish the debts he
had contracted to enable him to acquire
a knowledge of his profession; obliga-
tions, in some instances, that he was
bound by every principle of honor and
gratitude to redeem, shared a like fate.
So far from reducing his liabilities, he
was continually adding to them,—often
procuring pecuniary aid from friends
on various pretences of sudden and
unanticipated need, which were found
to be the grossest fabrications. After
living for several years in this way,
he accepted the situation of surgeon on
board a steamer bound to various dis-
tant ports, on a voyage of about a
year’s duration, giving as a reason
declining health; but, instead of re-
turning home in the vessel on her re-
turn, to resume his practice, which he
had left in the hands of another mem-
ber of the profession, he left the steamer
and sent for his family to join him at
San Francisco.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From that time little was heard of
him; he was, in a measure, forgotten,
until the details reached his former
place of residence, through the journals
of San Francisco, of one of the most
awful tragedies, in which he was the
chief actor, that ever transpired in a
civilized community. He had occupied
the upper portion of a dwelling, and
nothing being seen of him or his family
for an unusual length of time, his
fellow tenants became alarmed, and
failing to obtain admittance by other
means, broke open the door, when a
most frightful spectacle presented it-
self. He was found lying in bed, with
one arm extended over a waterpail
that was nearly filled with blood, and
had apparently been dead many hours;
by his side was his wife, and in an
adjoining room their daughter and only
child, about ten years of age, in both
of whom life was also extinct. From
a couple of brief notes that he had left,
it was learned that being in destitute
circumstances, he had administered
strychnine to his family, and then
committed suicide by opening the veins
in his arm. It seemed that in the case
of his child, the poison had not pro-
duced death so soon as he wished, and
he had then fractured her skull with
an iron window weight, that bore
evidences of having been used for that
purpose. Such a frightful tale of mur-
der and suicide naturally excited, at
first, the greatest astonishment among
those who remembered him here only
as a respectable physician, until the
fact became known that he had been
for a long time a confirmed gambler,
which fully explained, as a matter of
course, all that had previously been
incomprehensible in his character. One
of the most thrilling of the dramas of
a former day is “The Gambler’s Fate.”
but it presents nothing that equals tho
closing scene of this modern tragedy
of real life."{{< news/indent4 >}}Pacific.{{< /news/text >}}

"The Record" on Sir John
Lawrence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The peace of India has been well
maintained, if we except the Bhootan
war, which has just been terminated
by a treaty, the merits of which are
still under discussion. There can be
no doubt that a war with savage hill-
men, in a deadly climate, and at a
distance from the centre of power, is
no evil to be abated at any sacrifice
consistent with the Imperial honour
and the Imperial safety. We have full
confidence that both will be maintained
by Sir John Lawrence, in spite of the
ceaseless efforts of detractors, one sec-
tion of whom hate him for his religion,
which rebukes their ungodliness and
immorality, whilst another section
entertains opinions hostile to some of
his views of Indian policy. There is
a third party, who are affronted by
the simplicity of the Viceroy's habits,
and the absence of that Oriental splen-
dour in which his most illustrious
predecessors were accustomed to in-
dulge. It is possible that Sir John
Lawrence errs on the side of simplicity,
and forgets how Napoleon, when he
rose to power, remarked with eagle-
eye, and philosophie truth, as he look-
ed from his window on the Tuileries,
on the obvious impression produced
even on the revolutionary mobs by
gay uniforms and glittering decorations.
If this were true of human nature in
France, much more must it be so in
India, where the people have been so
long accustomed to barbarie pomp and
splendour. It may be also, as has
been alleged, that some of the Vice-
roy's retinue, in their zeal for economy,
have carried his own views on the
subject further than he intended. It
is a fault easily corrected, and if it
has somewhat paled the blaze of his
just popularity, it never can extinguish
the memory of that vigorous policy
which saved the empire of India, nor
materially counteract the efficiency of
the great talents, and the vast experi-
ence, by which God has been pleased
to render this Christian Viceroy so
great an ornament to Her Majesty and
her subjects.{{< /news/text >}}

Quarrelling.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}If anything in the world will make
a man feel badly, except pinching his
fingers in the crack of a door, it is,
unquestionably a quarrel. No man
ever fails to think less of himself af-
ter it than before. It degrades him in
the eyes of others, and what is worse,
blunts his sensibilities on one hand,
and increases the power of passionate
irritability on the other. The truth is,
the more peaceably and quietly we
get on, the better for our neighbours.
In nine cases out of ten, the better
course is, if a man cheats you, quit
dealing with him: if he abuses you,
quit his company: if he slanders you,
take care to live so that no one will
believe him. No matter who he is or
how he injures you, the wisest way
is to let him alone: for there is noth-
ing better than the cool, calm, and
quiet way of dealing with the wrongs
we meet with.{{< /news/text >}}

BRIGHTENING HOPES.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is with a good deal of hope we
hear that the Siamese government was
probably more in play than in earnest
in ridiculing Electric Telegraphs as ap-
peared in our issue of the 8th inst.
We are informed that the government
would be glad to have a Telegraph
line established between the King's
palace and the Bar provided it can
be done by a company purely inde-
pendent of government money, and
with such limitations as will give the
government control of the line in
times of war when she might be im-
peded by the want of such control.
If the Siamese government has indeed
advanced thus far, we shall think we
have good reason to hope she will take
other steps still more encouraging in
the same direction, until Bangkok
shall not only be in telegraphic com-
munication with Paknam and the
Bar, but also with Singapore, Tavoy,
Maulmain, Rangoon, and Calcutta—
nay with all the world.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are also cheered in our hopes
for the welfare of Siam by hearing
that the Siamese government is en-
tertaining quite seriously the pro-
position of a company in Singapore,
having connections in London, of grant-
ing to said company or to the English
government the privilege of establish-
ing a Telegraphic line in Siamese
territory that shall bring Maulmain,
Tavoy, and Singapore into electric
communication with Bangkok, and
that government has dispatched an
officer with letters to all the Siamese
provinces within the Malayan peninsula
seeking information relative to this
question.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Most heartily would we advise the
Siamese government to allow British
subjects to secure such interests within
her dominions, for we are persuaded
that it will tend to make England her
friend indeed in any future time of
need.—-Siam feels that she is still weak
and far behind the western nations in
very many respects, and this we regard
as a good indication for her future
prosperity provided it be accompanied
by a determination to increase in
knowledge and righteous power. The
Siamese government, we are persuaded,
has too much good sense to flatter her-
self that in this age of the world she
can stand wholly independent of the
protection of one or more of the great
western powers which have become
her near neighbors. It seems to us
that she should choose quickly in which
of these neighbors, her western or her
eastern, she will henceforward place her
chief reliance as a protector. France,
if she be faithful, will protect Cambo-
dia for Siam, and not with any inten-
tion of ever annexing her to her own
dominions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a fixed fact, and settled for ever,
we think, that England desires no more
extension, and will do every thing she
can honorably to avoid any further
annexation to her vast territory. Hence
Siam has no reason to fear that if she
herself be in a good degree faithful to
her treaty relations with Great Britain,
that she will ever be absorbed by her.
Nay she may most confidently expect
England to exert her powerful in-
fluence to strengthen and perpetuate
her as an independent nation. What
other neighboring power so strong, so
wise and so good can she find in which
to strengthen herself? She needs the
arm of a western power the least grasp-
ing, subtle, unreasonable, and ex-
horbitant: for all nations are prone to
have more or less of these unhappy qual-
ities. Let her loose no time in making
a selection in view of facts that have
but recently transpired. If she pre-
fer England for her ally though not
in form but in fact—-a power which she
has happily lived with as her western
neighbor for scores of years, let her
open the way more and more for Eng-
land to become mutually interested in
the welfare of Siam. Let England
have the privilege of Telegraph lines
in her territory, and a railroad as is
proposed across the isthmus of Kraw,
and a ship canal, even, in the same lo-
cality. In this way Siam may obtain
a powerful protector with but little
expense, and with no sacrifice of hon-
or, but a positive acquisition of power
and glory.{{< /news/text >}}

JOHN COLLINS WARREN M. D.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Through the kindness of a Boston
friend, we have recently enjoyed the
perusal of a neatly executed work of
two octavo volumes, comprising more.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}than 800 pages entitled The Life of
JOHN COLLINS WARREN M. D. Who
died at his residence in Boston May
4th 1856 aged nearly eighty years.
He was the elder, if we mistake not,
and perhaps the more skillful of two
illustrious American surgeons, who
had no equals in their profession with-
in the limits of the great American
Republic, if indeed any superiors in
Europe. The man alluded to as be-
ing so nearly his equal was VALEN-
TINE MOTT M. D. of New York city
who died two or three years since full
of riches and honors both temporal
and spiritual.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was our privilege in youth to sit
at the feet of both of these great and
good men. Would that we had made
a better improvement of the extraor-
dinary opportunities we then enjoyed
—-more especially that we had copied
more closely their benevolence. In
honor of Dr. John C. Warren our es-
teemed preceptor, and to the praise of
divine grace which wrought effectually
in him, we would now speak more es-
pecially of his christian character.
And in doing so we feel that we can-
not do better than to quote two brief
extracts from the work to which we
have referred. The first that we se-
lect is from a letter which he wrote to
his wife and children twenty three
years before his death, and one year
after we had received our last lessons
in anatomy and surgery from his lips.
It is the closing paragraph of his will,
which though in usual health, he felt
it to be his duty to have always in
readiness for a sudden death.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“May God Almighty, in his infi-
nite mercy, take you and my dear
children in his holy keeping, and pre-
serve you from the snares and dang-
ers of this world. May he give you
an awful and overpowering sense of the
amazing change which you must soon
be called to pass through! and by this
may he bring your hearts to feel the
indescribable importance of a full pre-
paration for this change, and a solemn
conviction that you have no hope of
salvation but by a perfect feeling of
your own unworthiness, and of the
absolute necessity of placing your
whole trust and confidence in the
atoning blood of your blessed Saviour
and Mediator Jesus Christ, which
alone is able to purify and justify you,
and bring you to the mansions of
everlasting happiness! May God bless
you all, is the prayer of your affec-
tionate husband and father.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such sobriety and solemnity we think
was eminently characteristic of the
whole christian life of Doctor Warren.
—-The following extract from his pri-
vate papers will show how much this
physician and surgeon of a world
wide renown loved the words of
Jesus.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“I never read this Chapter (XIV)
without experiencing a species of de-
light, which scarcely anything else
has power to excite,—a holy fervor
combined with melting tenderness. I
can almost realize the scene where
the heavenly comforter poured upon
the hearts of his mourning and won-
dering disciples the unction from above,
which rendered them superior to temp-
tation, and patient amid scenes of
tribulation. ‘I will come to you.
Yet a little while and the world seeth
me no more; but ye see me; because
I live, ye shall live also.’ These words
have sometimes been to my heart
what oil is to the commotion of the
billow. And shall this heart which
is capable of immortal blessedness
and expansion, resign its high privile-
ges and shrink from its exalted
duties?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I pray God to grant me strength to
renounce firmly, deliberately, and re-
ligiously every earthly hope. I desire
to preserve my heart from the danger
of creating an idol in his own temple,
and to be constant in my supplica-
tions to the Spirit who is the Sancti-
fier that will make of my heart a a
spotless sanctuary for his own abode.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How refreshing is it to look at a
man on the very pinnacle of eminence
in a learned profession, which is often
erroneously thought to be infidel in its
tendencies, so Christ-like in his daily
walk among men! The whole work
shows with charming clearness that a
life long seriousness and solemnity
with regard to the eternal future, and
a continual pressing onward and up-
ward towards heaven is no hinderance
or damper in the pursuit of the greatest
celebrity in the arts and sciences.{{< /news/text >}}

COCOANUT TREES.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We learn that Cocoanut trees in
Siam are being rapidly destroyed by
grub worms which eat out their vitals
at their tops. This is said to be one
cause of the high price now ruling for
cocoanuts and cocoanut oil. Twen-
ty catties in weight sells for about six
Ticals. This high price has so long
ruled that cocoanut oil is now being
imported at a fair profit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It appears that that disease among
the trees may be greatly controlled
by human skill. It has long been
known in this eastern world, and the
most successful treatment would seem
to be one akin to that of extinguishing
a conflagration. The trees that have
already been killed by the grubs and
all such as show unmistakable signs of
having grubs at work in them, must be
cut down and the animals killed. The
natives say they make excellent food
when cooked with the milk of the co-
coanut!—-so they need not be lost.
But it manifestly is too expensive to
cultivate them in the tops of cocoanut
trees. If left to themselves the grubs
by some means or other quickly take
possession of neighboring trees and
thus the destruction spreads.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It seems to us that the Siamese gov-
ernment, if she would have Siam con-
tinue to be enriched and beautified
by the cocus nucifera, she should
promptly issue a proclamation to have
all owners of cocoanut trees, cut down
forthwith all trees that have recently
died and such as are dying of this
disease, and require them to burn up
or eat up, as they may prefer, all the
grubs that are living in them. This
course will certainly stay the plague
and no other will.{{< /news/text >}}

H. S. M. G. B. IMPREGNABLE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have called on board His Siam-
ese Majesty's Gun Boat Impregnable to
have a look at the beautiful creature
as she is riding at anchor near our
dwelling. As you look at her from
without you are forced at once to ex-
claim—How completely European and
modern she is in all her appearance!
You can scarcely believe that she was
made in Siam and is manned entirely
by Siamese marines. And when you
come to step on board, and have a
close inspection of every part of the rig-
ging, the guns, the magazine, the saloon
the captain's cabin, the berths etc. you
become more than satisfied that the
Siamese are not a whit behind the
Chinese in their inititative powers.
And if you had been long intimately
acquainted with his Majesty Prabat
Pra-Pin Klow, the late second king as
we have been, you will not fail to see
his ingenuity, and skill, and neatness
and good taste imprinted on every
thing you see connected with the ves-
sel; for she belonged to him and was
his last work in that line.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Daniel Maclean Esq. our most dis-
tinguished ship builder, we are in-
formed, was the designer of this spright-
ly vessel by which he will be honored.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The "Impregnable" carries 1 Com-
mon gun-a 32 pounder, 2 Brass How-
etsers-24 pounders, and 1 Armstrong
gun-a 40 pounder.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Captain E. C. Walrond has by long
patience. and a good name, through
the influence of H. B. M's Consul
George T. Knox Esq. obtained a fine
berth for the display of his talents in
the Siamese navy. We hope and trust
he will prove himself well worthy of
his position. His men, numbering
more than fifty, look wonderfully neat
and able bodied for Siamese: but they
need yet much training in working
the guns ere they will stand a compar-
ison with European artillerymen. We
will with patience wait and see what
Capt. We can make of them.{{< /news/text >}}

Correspondence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
For the "Bangkok Recorder"
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. EDITOR ;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You are aware that I have heard
from Ulysses. Poor fellow! he is
wandering still, but it is apparently
a kind of mental aberration, worse by
far than a twenty years at sea. You
are also aware that he once feigned
dementation, lest he should be obliged
to leave his darling Penelope for a
Trojan war. He yoked the horse,
and bull together, and ploughed the
sea shore, and sowed salt. The com-
munication from him associates things
as unseemingly, as the yoking of the
horse and the ox, and also has appa-
rently a sprinkling of salt ; yet it is
not what I would have expected from
my long lost Ulysses. So different
is it from him, that I am sometimes
inclined to think, that some one has
disguised her sex, and assumed that
revered name, in order to tantalize
me. Look for a moment at the first
sentence of this wonderful communi-
cation. "It is a tempting the meof
speculation, and as it has already
been broached in your last two issues,
worth our while to follow it up in
imagination; but it must be done
with a mind clearly alive to every step
won in philosophy, every discovery
in science, every marked token of so-
cial advance, and progress of every
shape whatever—-with a liberal heart;
by which I mean a mind not narrowed
by its own acts, and opinions as the
minds of benevolent and truly pious
people are apt to be, but with a mind
respectful to every sort of individual-
ity, indulgent to all established cus-
toms or constitutional peculiarities as
to what the world would be without
dancing—-the twin sister of which is
music." You will recollect in the
outstart I laid no special claims to lit-
erary ability, and perhaps it may be
my obtuseness, but I confess that I
am unable to analyze this sentence so
as to make any sense out of it. The
thing predicated appears to be purely
in the imagination, and that is " what
the world would be without dancing."
But the mind capable of imagining
such a thing must be so broad, so
comprehensive, so benevolent, and so
indulgent to every fault, and peculiari-
ty, that I suppose no one person upon
earth even has or ever will possess it.
To find such a mind we would have
to fuse some of the greatest and most
benevolent minds upon earth, or call
down some eminent saint, whose men-
tal powers have long been expanding
in a world of glory. But after all, it
would not be difficult to imagine what
the world would be without dancing, in
its modern acceptation of the term. It
may be called the twin sister of mu-
sic; but they should both be the
handmaidens of religion. They were
originally so intended. The ancient
Hebrews, and Egyptians, frequently
accompanied their religious ceremo-
nies with music, and dancing; but
it consisted of little more than giving
expression to the feelings in gesticula-
tions, indicative of certain mental
emotions. The Greeks borrowed it
from the Egyptians. Polished and
improved by them, it was introduced
into all their festive ceremonies. They
were an athletic people, setting much
store upon bodily exercises, and
amongst them it still answered a good
purpose. The Romans again borrow-
ed from the Greeks, but their "salta[?]tio"
was still a gymnastic, and mimo-
tic exercises. Dancing became some-
what separated from religion among
the Greeks and Romans; but Plato
thought that all dancing should be
connected with religion, and based
upon it, as among the Egyptians. But
I believe the sexes did not mingle,
in the dances of any of those nations.
Dancing has become wholly divorced
from religion, as we find it now in this
Spanish fandango, the French quad-
rille and cotillion, and the German
waltz and gallopade. It has now
nothing in common with that of the
Hebrews, and Egyptians, and very
little with that of the Greeks and
Romans. Amongst modern heathen
nations we find it performed by hired
dancers, mostly female, for the amuse-
ment of those in higher life. If it
ever was an "inherent physical law,"
in its modern form, it has certainly
lost all that made it valuable as a
physical exercise. The attempt to
make it graceful has robbed it of all
those wild gesticulations, which gave
the "broad shoulders" to the Greeks.
Instead of being the "pleasant, ex-
hilarating, graceful study of every
well regulated" family, it frequently
destroys the peace and happiness of
those families where it is admitted.
The best regulated christian families,
will have nothing to do with it. Other
and far better physical exercises are
now provided in well regulated chris-
tian families, such as gymnastics and
calisthenics. As a physical exercise
alone it must be admitted that mod-
ern dancing is sadly deficient. It is
too local,—exercising only the lower
extremities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But in the communication in ques-
tion, we find the following remarkable
sentence. "And so blinded are some
really good worthy people in this mat-
ter, that they would prohibit danc-
ing, forsooth of its evil tendencies,
and all exhibitions of physical strength
as belonging to the barbaric ages, and
attempt to give us a maximum of
saintliness[?] with a minimum of pul-
monary digestive and weak morbid
capacity."—-" Parvum in multo"! But
suppose, for instance, that modern danc-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ing is not immoral in its tendencies,
shall one upon examination find it a
healthy exercise favorable to physical
development? I fear not. Take one
of our cities in Europe or America
where balls and select dancing parties
are the amusement of many the whole
year round. Four and five nights in
the week, are given to it. Nearly, if
not all, of the ladies’ time is wasted
in preparation. The hours allotted to
sleep, by nature, are spent in dancing.
Ladies attend those balls in cold damp
weather so thinly clad, and with shoes
never intended to keep the feet warm,
but merely to cover them. Exercising
violently in a warm ill ventilated
room, they return home at early
dawn chilled by the freshness of the
morning air. Nature has been robbed
of its necessary repose, and the whole
system is relaxed. Such a course, in
very many instances, results in severe
colds, pulmonary disease, and prema-
ture death. This is no fancy picture.
Every physician’s diary will attest
its truth. Thousands, especially
of young females, are thus hurried
prematurely into eternity. Yet those
“saints” who would dare say a word
against the practice, are held up by
would be philanthropists, great and
broad freethinkers, and pseudo-be-
nefactors of the race, as the “worst
sinners upon earth.” Dancing has al-
ways been found to be a damper up-
on religious feelings, and impressions
in any community, because it absorbs
the whole time and thoughts of the
young, and draws them from the con-
templation of those eternal things,
which pertain to their eternal welfare.
For that reason pious parents dread
its influence upon their children.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I do not think it advisable here to
enter into those details, which good peo-
ple think constitute the immoral ten-
dencies of dancing. I only, for
instance, mention the _Waltz_, and ap-
peal to all candid and impartial,
thinkers upon the subject, if they
can see nothing unbecoming in it!
When taken in connection with the
present modes of female dress, what
are likely to be its tendencies upon
the young? I acknowledge no such
pseudo-philosophy as that “_every_
social enjoyment is indifferent.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I am referred to my canary bird as
an example of that inherent principle
for dancing in nature. I don’t believe
he even thought of dancing, or I at
least have never seen any thing to in-
dicate it. He is a good singer, and
he knows it, and like some ladies, is
probably charmed with the sound of
his own voice. If he ever thought of
dancing, it was merely a leaping for
joy like David at the sight of the ark.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I am also pointed back to the days of
Queen Elizabeth for example of prac-
tical piety. Because Sir Walter Ra-
leigh led the fair old Queen to the
country dance, and they were christ-
ians, therefore dancing is not immoral
in its tendencies. Whilst there were
many things, both in the Queen, and
Sir Walter which all admire, and will
ever cherish in fond remembrance,
still there were also many things
which christians of the present day
must condemn. They lived too near
the middle ages, and we must not
overlook the times in which they lived.
Sir Walter thought it not wrong at
one time to receive a heavy bribe, and
I presume there are few christians
who would advocate bribery because
he received one. Says a writer on those
times, “A transaction so shameless,
has no other apology than that it was
not condemned by the opinion of the
age.” Happily, however, for the
church, and the world, times and
“_Saints_” are changing. I know of
no respectable religious denomination
now, in the U. S. at least, that would
advocate promiscuous dancing as a
healthy physical exercise. And here
I may state for the benefit of my pe-
culiarly sensitive readers, that by pro-
miscuous dancing I mean ladies. and
gentlemen dancing together, rather
than each sex dancing alone. By danc-
ing I refer to dancing in general, and
not that suggested by an “elegantly
managed ball” or any ball in parti-
cular.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Happily for the church, too, men do
not now, as a general thing, present
their “puny brainless offspring” to
the church and God, that they may
secure a “living.” There is a free
church where men voluntarily lay
their best offspring upon the altar of
the Lord. The talent in the ministry
of the present day is equal to, and if
any thing surpasses that of any other
of the learned professions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are many other fings in the
communication which I cannot con-
descend to notice. It winds up with
the following egotistic flourish. "But
after all it is my private opinion, that
too much thought is given to the
next world, by a "Vinegar" whole-
sale denunciation of the present.
One world ought to be enough for us
to manage at a time etc., etc." Any
thing so Jesuitical, and at the same
time so sceptical, I did not expect to
find in this community. At one sweep
it takes away the whole object of the
plan of salvation, and the teachings
of scripture. For Paul says "If in
this life only we have hope in Christ,
we are of all men most miserable."
Any one holding such sentiments as
these, is really more to be pitied
than the Fangs of Africa or the
Steins of Cambodia.{{< /news/text >}}

English opinion on the
Bhootan Treaty.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}ENGLAND has uttered no uncertain
sound on the humiliating policy which
dictated the Bhootan treaty. All the
leading, daily, and weekly journals have
condemned it except the Daily News
and the Times. The former is the
organ of the peace-at-any-price party;
[?]It spake the thoughts of the purely util-
itarian school of trade-politicians; 'it
is the exponent of Goldwin Smith who
would go so far as to give up every colo-
ny and military settlement which Eng-
land possesses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It will be observed that all these
opinions against the Treaty are based
on purely moral and political consid-
erations, and do not question the
soundness of the facts as to the difficul-
ty and desolation of the country, and
the necessity for mercy to its rulers,
on which alone the authors of the
Treaty rest their defence. But it is
satisfactory to find an authority like
Dr. J. D. Hooker, who has roamed
over Sikkim and in his book has told
us more of Bhootan than any other,
thus writing in the Times:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“It is asserted that the Bhootanese
would starve but for the Dooars we pro-
pose to occupy, and for which we are to
pay them rent. This is is a mistake.
They cling to the Dooars because they
there hold a timid race in slavery to grow
crops which go partly to support them-
selves in idleness, while the rest is sold
on the frontier to feed the Chinese troops
at L’Hassa. Bhootan consists of a series
of magnificent valleys as long as England
is broad, where between 1,000 and 7,000
feet elevation, rice, maize, millet, &c., are
grown without tillage or irrigation, and a-
bove that elevation all European grains
and vegetables flourish; its forests are im-
mense and its timber excellent, while cat-
tle, ponies, sheep, poultry are abundant
and of most excellent quality. Sikkim, a
far less productive province, was equally
regarded as an unproductive wilderness,
but has been redeemed from barbarism,
and under every discouragement made to
yield a revenue through the exertions of
its late political agent and superintendent.
Dr. Campbell; and half-a-dozen such men
in Bhootan, with the frontier open on the
north, and Assam to supply tea, rice, su-
gar, tobacco, &c., in the south, would raise
a splendid revenue in a few years, and
civilize a vast tract of country now held
by a nation of as treacherous, indolent,
debauched, and priest-ridden barbarians
as the world ever saw.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If any confidence is to be placed in
the united testimony of every authori-
ty who has really penetrated the coun-
try, from Major Turner to the mem-
bers of Lord Elgin’s Mission, this is
true. It is much more true of West
than of East Bhootan where the Tong-
so Penlow rules. But those who hold
an opposite opinion, who paint the
barren hills, the howling ravines, the
pathless valleys, the malarious jungle,
and the poverty-stricken land, are the
military or civil authorities who have
never gone ten miles beyond Buxa
and Dewangiri, or who think that be-
cause the hill country has been mis-
governed and depopulated it is incapa-
ble of becoming prosperous. At pre-
sent the bulk of the testimony of eye-
witnesses, as given in the Blue Book,
and stated by Dr. Hooker, is against
the lugubrious apology of our humi-
liated Government. Whether, there-
fore, we look to honour, which the
authors of the Treaty admit to have
been sacrificed, or to difficulties which
the most reliable testimony shows to
be exaggerated, in the present state of
our information, the almost unanimous
verdict of England and India against
the Treaty is fully justified.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Jamaica.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We suppose that most of our readers
have read, in the daily papers, the
particulars of what is called the insur-
rection in Jamaica and its suppression.
We shall therefore only touch on a
few of the more prominent points.
And, first of all, there is not a title of
evidence produced by Governor Eyre
to show that there existed any con-
spiracy at all. The existence of an
intended insurrection seems to rest
only on vague rumors, arising, doubt-
less, from the fears of the conscience-
stricken planters. That extensive and
well-grounded discontent existed
throughout the island is unquestionable
from sources quite independent of Gov.
Eyre; but that there was any scheme
for the general extermination of the
whites and browns, there has as yet
been nothing like evidence to show.
The fact that Mr. George W. Gordon,
who was extra judicially murdered as
the chief promoter of this conspiracy,
was a brown man with a white wife
would seem to be a sufficient con-
tradiction of this assertion. A bloody, 
but by no means unprovoked, riot at
Morant Bay seems to be the only fact
established by evidence of any violence
committed or contemplated by the
negroes before the massacres began.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The original cause of the riot was a
question of disputed title, which ex-
cited general interest among the
negroes, whose demonstration of it an-
noyed the court, who ordered one of
them into custody. He was rescued.
This was on Saturday. Warrants
were issued for the arrest of the re-
cuers; which were resisted. On the
next meeting of the court, on Wed-
nesday, a great body of negroes came
down to attend it. There was noth-
ing but their numbers that rendered
them formidable. There is no evid-
ence whatever that they had any pur-
poses of violence. The magistrates
had a small force of eighteen volunteers,
who, after a hasty reading of the riot
act, fired on the blacks, killing and
wounding several of them. Then the
blacks rushed in, overpowered the
volunteers, sacked the court-house,
killed several of the magistrates, of the
police, and the volunteers. Other acts
of violence on the part of the negroes
are reported, with particulars of atroc-
ities attending them, which all want
any authentication excepting rumor.
That acts were thus committed which
deserved punishment we may well be-
lieve; but that these riots were any
part of a concerted movement on the
part of the negroes does not any where
appear. It will be remembered that
they were fired on fatally, without any
absolute necessity, before there was
any blood shed by them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On this provocation the governor
proclaimed martial law in that district,
excepting Kingston, the capital, and
immediately proceeded to hang, shoot,
and whip men and women right and
left. The troops perambulated the
region, without meeting with a symp-
tom of armed resistance, arresting,
hanging, and shooting all and singular
that they come across. One gallant
officer, having taken more prisoners
than he could well guard, made sure
of them by shooting them on the spot,
without even the ceremony of a drum-
head court-martial. A large number
of men and women, some fifty or
there-abouts, were arrested by another,
and, as nothing whatever was brought
against them, their lives were mer-
cifully spared, and they were only tied
successively to a gun and fifty lashes
administered on their bare backs.
One of them, indeed, presuming to
gnash his teeth and give a disrespect-
ful look at the presiding officer, at the
forty-seventh lash, was instantly strung
up to teach him better manners. But
the case which will excite the most
attention in England, doubtless, from
the fact that the victim was a man of
wealth and position, and a member of
the assembly was that of Mr. G. W.
Gordon, before mentioned. This gen-
tleman had made himself odious to the
government of the island and the pro-
prietary class by his zeal in behalf of
the blacks. He was in Kingston, far
from the scene of the riot, and there has
not appeared a particle of evidence to
connect him with it in the slightest
degree. A warrant was issued against
him, but he surrendered himself before
it could be served. Kingston was
specially excepted from the operation
of martial law, so Governor Eyre had
him taken round to Morant Bay within
its jurisdiction, summarily tried by
court-martial, and hanged! Whatever
may be said for the other killings, it
is hard to see how this can be taken
out of the category of legal murder.
And after this campaign against un-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}armed men, with no blood shed but
that of persons entirely innocent, with
one or two exceptions, of the original
rioting. Governor Eyre recommends
the officers, whose only merit was
their readiness to shed the blood of
unresistingmen and women, to thenotice
of the commander-in-chief, for pro-
motion! We doubt whether there was
ever before "honorable mention in the
dispatches" on such grounds as this.
But it will be responded to, and we
venture to predict that within three
months Governor Eyre will be gazet-
ted as Sir E. Eyre, K. C. B. We are
glad to see that these atrocities have
excited a very general indignation on
the part of the liberal portion of the
English people. The papers and per-
sons who felt with us during our war
are loud in their demands for justice.
But the *Times* and the organs of
the governing classes range themselves
on the side of the planters of Jamaica,
as they did on that of those of South
Carolina.{{< /news/text >}}

Applying The Sermon.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Nott, a missionary to one of the
Islands in the Pacific Ocean, preached
a sermon one day on the words “Let
him that stole, steal no more.” In the
sermon he said that it was a duty to
return things that had formerly been
stolen.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The next morning, when he opened
his door, he saw a number of natives
sitting on the ground around the house.
He was surprised to see them there
so early, and asked why they had
come. “We have not been able to
sleep all night,” they said. “We were
at chapel yesterday, and heard you say
from the Word of God that Jehovah
commanded us not to steal; whereas
we used to worship a god who, we
thought, would protect thieves. We
have stolen, and all these things we
have brought with us are stolen goods.
“Then one of the men held up a saw,
saying, “I stole this from the carpen-
ter of such and such a ship.” Others
held up knives and various tools.
“Why have you brought them to me?”
asked Mr. Nott. “Take them home,
and wait till the ships from which you
stole them come again, and then return
them with a present besides.” Still,
the people begged Mr. Nott to keep
the things until they could find the
owners. One man who had stolen
from a missionary, then being on an-
other island, took a voyage of seventy
miles to restore the goods.{{< /news/text >}}

can not but remember that domestic
wine introduced the cause of drunken-

hardly be trusted to expel the evil,
unless it has ceased to be what God
in his word declares it to be, a “mock-
er.” It is an instructive fact, that
families who go into the production,
and indulge in the consumption of
domestic wine, nine times in ten cease
thereafter all direct efforts to save
men from death and destruction by
whisky.—-Dr. Jewett{{< /news/text >}}

Odds and ends.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—Diphtheria is a very troublesome
and dangerous disease. A very easy
remedy has been found for it that will
effect a speedy relief. Take a common
tobacco pipe, place a live coal in the
bowl, drop a little tar upon the coal,
draw the smoke into the mouth and
discharge it through the nostrils—
The West Indian.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-To love and to labor is the sum of
all living; and yet how many think
they live who neither labor nor love.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—The proof reader of the London
Times receives an editorial salary—
but has to forfeit one guinea for eve-
ry typographical error, even a turned
letter in each day's impression: if he
has marked an error on the proof, the
compositor who neglects to correct it
pays the forfeit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—Two old New England ministers
were riding by a gallows, when the
elder one asked the other: “Where
would you be if that tree bore its
proper fruit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—"Riding alone, sir,” was the imme-
diate reply.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-“Pat, buy a trunk to put your
clothes in,” said his Yankee compan-
ion. “What, and go naked this cold
weather?” asked the honest spalpeen
of Killarney.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-“Billy,” said a benevolent vender
of food for stoves, as with cheerful vis-
age he sat down to his matutinal repast,
“is it cold?” “Werry cold, father,”
was the reply. “Is the gutters froze,
Billy,” rejoined the parent. “Werry
hard, father, they is,” was the response.
“Ah!” sighed the old gentlemen,
“put up the coal two pence a pan,
Billy. God help the poor!”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—A medical student who had been
screwed pretty hard at his examination
for admission to the faculty, on a very
warm day, was nearly overcome by the
questions put to him, when the follow-
ing query was added:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“What course would you adopt to
produce a copious perspiration!”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After a long breath he observed,
wiping his forehead,—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“I would have the patient examined
by the Medical Society!”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-Folly would do but little mischief if
it were confined to fools.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—Most of the shadows that cross the
pathway in life are caused by standing
in our own light.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-Why is a married man like a candle !
Because he sometimes goes out at night
when he ought not to.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—A worthy man who was hesitating
whether he should marry a woman pious
but cross-grained, or another who was
amiable but not specially religious, ask-
ed his pastor’s advice upon the subject.
He advised him to take the woman he
loved, remarking: “John, the grace of
God can live where you and I can’t.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—A little fellow, not more than five
years of age, hearing some gentlemen
at his father’s table discussing the fa-
miliar line, “An honest man’s the
noblest work of God” said he knew it
wasn’t true, his mother was better than
any man that was ever made.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-A lady’s dressing table is perhaps
called a toilet, because it is the scene most
of her toil is generally performed.{{< /news/text >}}
