Bangkok August 1st.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are in a better condition now to en-
dure the irregularity of our mails, than we
were some moiths ago. The apparently
quiet state of Europe and America relieves
to a great extent that constant anxiety
which formerly existed, as to what would
transpire next in the Western World. The
great civil war in the United States is at an
end, and except the little breezes excited
in France by the speech of Prince Napoleon,
and the news from Mexico, Europe is also
quiet. True there are some questions pend-
ing, the settlement of which will probably
cause more or less discussions. Indeed the
discussion has already commenced. The
demand either has, or is about to be renew-
ed by the Federal Government, for indem-
nity from the English Government on ac-
count of the Alabama and other privateers
fitted out in English ports. Some of the
English papers talk rather warlike, and
speak of an alliance between England and
France-the two great Western powers of
Europe, to preserve the peace of the world.
Much of this of course is merely talk,
The privateer business must be settled up,
a precedent of some kind must be establish-
ed. When the demand was first made by the
United States government, Secretavy
Seward said, they were willing to defer the
discussion of the matter until both parties
could do it more calmly, than at that time,
and he also expressed a willingness to have
it settled by arbitration.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Although the Federal Government will
probably never be better prepared for a
foreign war than at present, yet she will
think several times before going to war for
a few millions indemnity. Her whole
course too, since she has considered the re-
bellion subdued, shows that the government
does not contemplate a foreign war. She
has reduced in every possible way her mili-
tary establishments to a peace footing.
England too will think several times before
going to war at present even in alliance with
France. We believe with Beecher that the
United States is the "most dangerous pow-
er in the world and at the same-time least
to be feared," we believe that she is capable
to day of resisting successfully an alliance
of the two great powers of Europe. As to
affairs in Mexico it is very probable that
six months after date will not find the Arch-
duke in that countr?, but the United States
we think, will not contribute to that event.
at least in such a way as to endanger her
relations with France.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The question in the United States now
appears to be "what is to be done with the
negro." This question may again endanger
the peace of the country. There are always
those who are never satisfied. The desire was
emancipation, and now when emancipa-
tion has come there still is a cry in some
quarters to place at once the ballot box in
the hands of the freedmen. This however
will meet with very general opposition
throughout the North. President Johnston
talks sensibly when he says he hopes to see
them all happily settled in a country of
their own. This is a quest¡on however
which will require great wisdom and dis-
cretion to settle. It would be madness to
place the ballot box in the hands of the
negro in his present ignorant condition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In China the rebellion still continues and
the insurgents have gained another ad-
vantage. Chefoou-shein the birthplace of
Confucius in the province of Shantung has
been taken, and sacked.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What we want most in Siam in a business
point of view is business—and business too
that will pay. The next crop is looked for-
ward to with much anxiety, but of course
little can be known about it. Here we have
certainly not had as much rain as we usual-
ly have in this month, but reports from
other portions of the country are encourag-
ing. In the province of Petchaburee the
season is very promising. We have also
seen two Europeans just returned from a
tour up the Banpakong and who bring fa-
vorable reports from that quarter. But even
if the crop should be good the prices in
the China market are such, as to cast a shade
over the business prospects here for some
time to come.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Vicksburg paved the way for higher ad-
vancement.  Rosecrans had failed at Chica-
manga, and was removed.  A new and larger
department was formed called the depart-
ment of the Mississippi, and given to Grant.
As soon as possible he hastened to the field.
Jeff. Davis, supposing the Union army una-
ble to advance soon, had ordered Long-
street to leave Bragg's army and go to
Knoxville Tennessee, and attack Burnside.
Grant saw that it was his time to move and
ordered an advance.  The rebel army was
consequently driven from its strong holds
on Missionary Ridge, and Lookout Moun-
tain, and the battle ended in the perfect rout
of the rebels.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A motion was soon introduced into con-
gress renewing the rank of Lieutenant Gen-
eral and conferring that rank upon U. S.
Grant. That rank had never been previously
conferred upon any one except Washing-
ton, Gen. Scott held it only by brevet. It
constitutes the person upon whom it is con-
ferred, General-in-chief of the armies of the
United States. Grant was accordingly called
to Washington. Taking with him his
little son he started for the Capital, and
soon after arriving at Willard's Hotel he
was recognized when about to take his seat
at the table, and the several hundred guests
arose and cheered him. Ladies waved their
kerchiefs and all hands were extended. The
President placed in his hands his commis-
sion as Lieutenant General, and he hastened
at once to the front. Whilst at Washing-
ton he had to pass through one of the Pres-
ident's levees, at which he out-shone "Old
Abe" himself, but he remarked to some
one that he hoped to get away from Wash-
ington as soon as possible as he was tired
of "this show business." He at once a-
bandoned the old anaconda plan of con-
ducting the war, and abandoning also many
places of minor importance, he massed his
forces for a vigorous campaign. To Sher-
man he committed the department of the
Mississippi, with Atlanta as the goal, whilst
he himself hastened to prosecute the cam-
paign in Virginia. He no sooner reached
the front than he showed as usual his work-
ing propensities. About 22d of February
Washington's birth day, a large ball room
was erected near Gen. Warren's head quar-
ters, and was thronged with dancers. Ladies
from a distance were delighted with the
soldierly frolic, and some of them approach-
ed Gen. Grant on the subject expressing
the hope, that there would be another soon
in the army of the Potomac. Gen. Grant
replied that if another were attempted, he
should consider it his duty to stop it, by a
special order, and that it was no time for
music and dancing. Gen. Grant is op-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Shortly after arriving at the front and
whilst looking over his new field, near Cul-
peper Court House his head quarters, in a
drizzling rain and attended only by his or-
derly, a carriage approached. It was drawn
by fine horses and attendants escorted it.
When near Gen. Grant, the driver reined
up and the door opened and out sprang a
dashing officer. He enquired if the drip-
ping little man in his presence were Gen.
Grant. The latter replied in the affirmative.
The officer said he wished to see the General
on business. "Come walk with me" an-
swered Grant. "There was no other alterna-
tive and the highly polished boots of the
officer had to go into the mud, and his gay
uniform and plumage were soon beaten
down and soaked with rain. The officer
was thus introduced to the new order of
things about to be carred out in the army
of the Potomac.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Galena neighbor of Grant's visited
New York about this time, and was utterly
confounded at the sudden growth of his
neighbor, the tanner. He said when at
home nobody considered Grant a "great
man." He seldom talked, asked no advice,
and gave none to any one, but minded his
own business and always did what he a-
greed to do at the time." May 3d 1864
Gen. Grant issued his orders to march.
Scarcely had he crossed the Rapidan than
he was confronted by Lee's whole army at
the "Wilderness," a portion of land cover-
ed with scrub oak bushes, deep gullies, and
swamps. Sheridan had been sent out with
his cavalry to feel the way. Soon a dis-
patch came to Gen. Meade who opened the
seal and read it and turning to Grant said
"Lee intends to fight us here." Grant
coolly replied "very well."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The strife soon commenced and after six
days of the most severe fighting the world
has ever known, the enemy were obliged to
full back to the strong works at Spotsylva-
nia. The losses were very great on both
sides but the advantage was greatly in favor
of the Federals. Gen. Grant perceiving that
the present position was too strong to be
taken without fearful sacrifice of life, com-
menced that series of flank movements by
which he threw his army to the south side
of the James River, and eventually across
the Weldon Railroad south of Petersburg.
Gen. Lee realized immediately the import-
ance of the position which Grant had gain-
ed, and made every effort to cause him to
release his hold. He attacked Grant's lines
wherever he supposed they were weakest
He then dispatched Early with 30,000 men
to invade Maryland, and Pennsylvania,
and to threaten Washington, thinking
Grant would ruin the seige and go to the
rescue of Washington, but he was mistaken
in his man. Grant did not relax his hold
in the least, nor give up a mile that he had
gained, and his remarks to some one about
that time were characteristic of him, that
he "would not release his hold upon Rich-
mond if Washington, Philadelphia, and
New York were laid in ashes." In about
eleven months after he commenced his Vir-
ginia campaign he had taken Richmond,
and the army of Gen. Lee. Those last three
days fighting, the evacuation of Richmond,
and the pursuit and capture of Lee are
familiar to all. By his orders too, Sherman
had left Atlanta in his rear, and marched
across the great state of Georgia to Savannah
and taken it, and thence to Charleston the
birth place of treason, and rebellion, and
found it evacuated, and thence to Columbia,
and thence to North Carolina, where he re-
ceived the surrender of Gen. Johnston, and
the only remaining rebel force of any ac-
count east of the Mississippi, and virtually
ended the great rebellion. To Gen. Grant
more than any other man is the United States
indebted for the subduing of that rebellion.
We think that it may be justly said that
has been oftener under fire and won more
Victories than any man living.{{< /news/text >}}

Chieng Mai Trip
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 74)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Editor-—More than two months
have passed since you had the promise of
a closing article on the Laos tour. It has
been so long now, that were it not for ful-
filling the promise I would let it pass. I
must do it now however, even though
your readers might more readily forgive its
breach than its fulfilment. Our narrative
was brought down to our departure from
Chieng Mai. Chow Rat-bokee was very
punctual for a native official in getting us
off. Our letter to him called for elephant
boats, or men, or whatever we might require.
We chose the river route on our return for
the same reason in part, that we preferred
the overland in going, as we could return
sooner than on elephants. In addition to
this we wished to see much of the coun-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}try as we could, and particularly the famous
rapids, of which we had been told by the
natives, who said that no foriegners had ever
passed them. It would have been the
prince's preference to have sent us back the
way we had come. He would then have
had to send us only to Lampoon one day's
journey, while in the latter case he had to
send us with a boat all the way to Ráhààng
where our own was left. But I should say
however, in justice to him, that this prefer-
ence for the other route did not seem to be
from a desire to shirk responsibility off on
other shoulders, but because they were
more accustomed to use elephants than
boats, and there was probably less risk of
an accident. This is evident because he
offered to send us a north east route via
Muang Phros and Muang Nan, and other
towns across to the east or Pitsanulok fork.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That would, I suppose, have been on some
accounts the grandest route of the whole,
and the offer was very tempting. But we
had other attractions to lead us to the
shortest way homeward, though I would
suggest the other, to the consideration of
any one who wished to return leisurely
from Chieng Mai to Bangkok. Going in
this way with a letter from each governor
and an escort of as many elephants and
guides as might be desired, it would be
perfectly safe, though a white man had
never touched a foot of the road before.
But we resisted the temptation of seeing
the northern Laos towns, and nearing the
borders of Thibet, and the Haw tribes of
China, by several degrees, which would
have taken about a month, for the nearest
and quickest way home. And surely we
had no reason to rue our bargain. True our
quarters were about as narrow as possible
into which a human being could be com-
pressed. Imagine a boat thirty feet in
length and about two in breadth. Over
about sixteen feet in the middle was a cover
rudely made, by bending over the split
bamboos for ribs, covered by the large
leaves of the celebrated teak. This cover
was just high enough to allow us to sit
upright. It was long enough too, for my
companion and I, each to have a bed at the
end where we could have a little air at
night, and to hold our little baggage be-
tween us. The remainder was deck where
our men at to paddle, and which also af-
forded as a seat during the day shaded by
our umbrellas. In this little craft, the best
for swiftness, which reconciled us to its in-
conveniences, we were to make our home
for the next ten days, and pass down the
rapids where we had sometimes to go with
incredible speed within six inches of huge
stones, and that too where the bed of the
river was so narrow and crooked, that our
long boat could just clear them on either
side in time to turn down the stream with-
out danger.  I have no doubt that in reality
it was much more fright ful and dangerous
than the celebrated Scylla and Charybdis,
over which our youthful blood used to
shudder in our school boy days. While
on the subject of the boat I may as well
anticipate another remark, that in passing
the lower and worst rapids we had a kind
of raft of several bamboos attached to the
boat on each side, which served alike to
impede its progress and to keep it steady.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We had a letter from the authorities at
Chieng Mai, to the head men of the nearest
villages, to furnish us with guides whose
business it is to conduct boats down those
Käangs, as they are called by the Siamese
and Laos. We thus had the satisfaction of
knowing that our guides were skilled in
their work. They were stalwart men, and
held a steady hand, and withal knew that
their own lives would probably be the for-
feit for any serious accident that might
happen to us, even should they escape the
same catastrophe which would not be at
all probable.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From Wednesday evening till Saturday
noon we had nothing of special interest.
The river in that portion presents very
much the same appearance that most of the
Siamese rivers do, except that mountains
were to be seen some distance off a consid-
erable portion of the way. On Saturday
at noon we came to the nearest village
above the Kaangs, where we were to get
our guides. By urging our cause a little
we had but a short delay, as we were anx-
ious to get beyond the first five rapids to
Ban K'âw, the next village where we were
to get new guides and spend the sabbath.
We left about 2 P. M. on tiptoe with expec-
tation, but half fearing that we might after
all be disappointed. Very soon however
the mountain ranges on each side began
to draw towards the river, and we began
to believe that we might have some rapids
or waterfalls, or some other violent erup-
tions or effort of nature, to make an egress
from our river and a road for ourselves.
And it is just where the mountains on each
side came down to the river that the first
one occurs. This was also true of many of
the subsequent ones, they often occurred
where the sudden turn in the mountain
chain, made a corresponding bend in the riv-
er, though this was not a universal rule, the
largest and longest of all being where
the river was comparatively straight. I
might as well remark here too, that both
their length and the distance intervening
between them, and the fall of water in each,
are very irregular. Sometimes, especially
in the upper ones, they would not be more
than one or two hundre?l yards in length.
It would be an interesting field for the en-
gineer to ascertain the whole fall of the
river, as well as of the rapids. We made
our distance to Ban K'âw, reaching there
about dusk, where we spent a Sabbath, quiet
enough for the most retiring, and romantic
enough for any of the most ardent admirers
of the beautiful works of nature.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Monday morning, we were off again,
but no longer unbelieving as to the beauty
and grandeur of the scenery which now
opened up to our view at every step. It
seemed to be a constant struggle between
beauty and grandeur, sometimes the one
and then the other prevailing, and often
both combined. It is for the most part
however a scene of everchanging beauty.
The river winds its way along between the
mountains which ascend perpendicularly
from one bank, the other ascending up in
amphitheatrical order. Sometimes, though
rarely, the ascent is gradual on both sides,
while in one place, the grandest of all, it is
perpendicular from both. Whence have
we come, and whither are we going? it is
the natural exclamation, as we find ourselves
shut in at every bend by mountains from
which there seems to be no possibility of
escape.  The river is peculiarly winding,
and this makes the almost endless variety,
as one phase after another passes in panor-
amic view before us.  Seldom can we see
more then a quarter of a mile of the scen-
ery at a time.  On each side the river is
hemmed in by banks of solid stone, rising
in the form of the mountain already des-
cribed.  That round mountain just behind
us was a few moments since our river
bank, and just before us, completely shut-
ting up our way is the one that will soon
become so, though whether on the right or
the left it is yet impossible to tell.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the anxious look firmly grasp-
ed our, and fixed determination of the
guides, as well as the roaring sound in the
distance before us, we knew that we were
approaching another rapid.  When the
storm is raging it is no time to catechise
the captain; and when nearing the rapids,
leave the pilot to his own musings.  Even
he feels that it is a serious matter, every
one for a few moments partake of his so-
lemnity.  Not a word is spoken except by
the pilot who simply gives in monosyllables
his orders, to "let out strength" on the
right or the left.  As he draws near the
scene he speaks in a louder and a quicker
tone, the oars are raised in unison till in
the midst of the water-fall every one seems
to be laying on for a death struggle as if all
depended on his strength.  The waves for
a few moments dash against the boat, and
now we are passed another in safety. A
general taking of breath is the signal that we
are out of danger, an I may again look at
the beautiful veins running through the
mountain rock on our left, with its stylac-
tites hanging down in its crevices, the fascin-
ation of ages, and also on the gently slop-
ing ascent to the right covered with its
beautiful green Mei Ruak.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The sun has long gone down behind the
western mountains, and the heavy shades
of evening have long fallen on the river,
and all the mountains except the topmost
portion of the eastern ridge where, his rays
still linger, making quite a contrast with the
sombre hue below.  It is Monday evening
as we still pass along, humming the Cana-
dian boatman's song.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent2 >}}"Row boatmen row.

{{< news/indent2 >}}The stream runs fast;

{{< news/indent2 >}}The rapids are near,

{{< news/indent2 >}}And the daylight is passed."

{{< news/text >}}Our men are evidently making prepara-
tions to stop on yonder sand bank, in time
to give us a few moments to gather a few
specimens of the rocks and climb up a small
knoll on the mountain.  But it is too late
to enjoy the scenery, or to shoot a deer, or
a wild peacock, that runs off at the approach
of man.  We soon take the travelers sim-
ple fare and try to compose our excited
minds to sleep.  The visions of the day
however haunt us, till long after our weary
boatmen are fast asleep. Our own frame
at length gives way to gentle slumber, and
visions of the fairy land through which we
passed, combined with those of home and
the loved ones left behind. But before the
leopard in the neighboring mountain had re-
tired to his lair, or the birds began to perch
on the trees and to sing their chorals, and
offer their morning song of praise to their
great Creator, we were up again ready for
another day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We started as soon as the disappearance
of the fog from the river rendered it safe
to do so. I need not repeat the incidents
of to-day except where they varied from
those of yesterday. One or two places how-
ever deserve a special notice. It is now
9¾ A. M. as we enter a place that defies all
my feeble powers of description. It is here
that the mountain rises on each side per-
pendicularly at least (000) six hundred feet,
a solid mass of stone. I say perpendicular-
ly. On the left this is literally true. In fact
in some places it so far projects over the
river, that the beautiful little cascade that
makes its way down its sides, the only
relic of what must be quite a stream during
the rains, falls over the boat on the other
side. The river is not more than 30 or 40
feet in width. One has an indescribable
feeling of awe as he passes through that
deep chasm, as if in some deserted street of
an old city built by giants of former ages,
but of which no trace remains. Or rather
he has a more lively perception than usual
of the infinite resources of Him who laid the
foundations of the earth like Tophat of old
"deep and large." The sun never appears
here till near noon and sets early in the
evening. The name of the place is "Pen
"Fa" which very appropriately means as-
cending the sky. The Kấấng below it was
unusually rapid, so that we had to get out
and walk across a bend while the boat was
let down by ropes. We had to do this
twice during the day. The 30th in num-
ber was the largest and straightest. It must
be near a mile in length. But just there the
river divides out into several channels so
that the current was not so swift. We
passed the last mountain just before dark
on Tuesday, when we had the broad open
plain of Rhãháng again - I would only say
in dismissing this portion of our journey,
that I have had to omit much that would
have been interesting, such as the names
given to the falls: the whole thirty five are
named, some of the names referring to
something real or supposed in the scenery
around, such as "Hot-Noi, Ang-Rawng,
Pen-Fa, Ok-Ma, Kala-Hluang, &c. &c."
The whole route would be a splendid field
for the skilful and scientific geologist, and
might amply repay the Siamese government
for employing one, by the valuable mines
which might be discovered. As for ourselves
we came through so rapidly that we did not
even have time to avail ourselves of the
benefits of the small geological knowledge
that we possess. The scientific man would
wish to go leisurely, and might well afford
to go up the stream. But let no one who
desires only the passing effect ascend it,
as it would be slow and tedious. To get
merely the pleasing effect of the whole I
suppose ours was the best plan, to make
no stoppage whatever, though I would not
take that course from choice. Any one
would wish to spend at least a week in
passing them. We reached Rahááng on
Thursday evening, and left next morning
for Bangkok. Our deceptive river, that had
tried us so much before, had laid aside its false
colors. The water had subsided and we
could always tell where the channel lay.
We were troubled somewhat for a day or
so by sticking on the sand bars, but reached
Bangkok on Saturday 7th Feb. 1845. after
a passage of 9 days from Rahááng, and an
absence of 79 days. But one closing re-
mark, in the account of the whole tour I
have purposely omitted its missionary as-
pect, that having been more fully given else-
where.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Editor-—When there in such a
dearth of news in the country, probably
your readers might be pleased with any in-
telligence from an out province, even if it
is only the prognostications concerning the
weather and the prospects of the rice crop.
Your mercantile readers will regret to learn
that the rains are to be scarce, the river low
and the rice crop small. So say the weather
astrologers, or rather the dualists in Pet-
chambré. It might however serve to lessen
their anxiety to know the data on which
such predictions are based. Well, it is
simply because the weather was dry and the
river low, from the seventh to the tenth of
July inclusive, or the last two days of the
waxing, and the first two of the waning
moon of the 8th Siamese month.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Siamese regard those four days as
the middle of the harvest months; there be-
ing three days before and three after that
time. And the weather was people of
Petchaburee say that it has been noticed
"from time immemorial" that the state of
the weather during these four days deter-
mines; or is more correctly an index to
the same during the whole season. When
they are dry and the river low, we may ex-
pect a scarcity of rain, but the reverse when
it rains and the river is flush at the time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It so happened that this year the weather
was then unusually clear and but little water
in the river. It was more remarkable too
because the rains had been abundant before,
and there was every prospect of a good crop.
But notwithstanding this is regarded as a
sign "that never fails" we are ourselves
inclined as yet, to look on the bright side
of things, and to hope that the favorable
prospects may not be darkened. With the
single exception of the above unfavorable
omens the prospects are certainly very fair
at present, though the season is not far
enough advanced to allow any correct pre-
dition as to what the crops may be. There
never was a time when there was so much
land under cultivation, or as many laborers
engaged in the fields before. Every one
who can buy a field has one, and those
who cannot, rent or propose new ones, so
that the public works have almost stopped
for want of carpenters and workmen. And
as yet the season has been most auspicious.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The rains were rather late in commencing
but for the last six weeks they have been
abundant. As yet there has been no super-
fluity and no scarcity. The rice fields are
now more than half planted by means of
the rain water, while to crown the prospects
for a few days past, the river has risen so
high that the water is now rushing out
through the innumerable canals to gladden
the heart of those who are dependent on the
river for their crop.  It is also interesting
to see that the people are turning their at-
tention to other species of agriculture, so
that there may be something for the staff
of life should the rice crops fail.  In taking
a ride the other day to K’ow Hluang, my
eyes were feasted with the sight of a large
corn field to the left in a place newly
cleared.  It reminded me of a good field
of hoe corn.  I understand that there is a
great deal planted in corn the present year.
Outside of the subject of the crops, we
have but little news of general interest.
The gambling fever has assumed an epidem-
ic type, and a very malignant character.
It was always bad enough, but since the
new game of Hooi, or lottery, has been
established the mania has increased manifold.
Formerly the state of the market and the
rice crops was the subject of conversation
by people in the market and on the roads,
but now the great question of the day is
"what letter is to take the prize" Fortune
tellers and spirits are consulted to disclose
the favoural one.  The lottery agents and
secretaries have their stands in different
portions of the town which are often crowd-
ed by those who wish to try their chance at
a fortune.  I understand that the man who
has the monopoly of it in Bangkok, pays
the government two hundred and fifty cat-
ties, and that he has farmed it out in Pet-
chaburee at the rate of three catties per
day, or over one thousand per year.  But
even this does not show the extent of the
drain from the pockets of the prople, as
the Petchaburee monopolist must make his
profits also.  Who is responsible for its
establishment is not for me to say, but
surely it is a "penny wise and pound foolish
policy" in the government to allow it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Only one other item suggests itself to
me now, A week or two ago I had occa-
sion for the first time to accompany one
in our employ to a Siamese court of justice!
and witness the practical operation of their
system of jurisprudence. It is said that
before the present Lieut. Governor came
here, there was a great deal of corruption
and bribery, in that department of this
place. But it is the universal testimony of
all, that he cannot be bribed, and I suppose
there is no place in Siam that has a more
upright judge than he is. He has under
officers who take the testimony on both
sides in writing, and one day in every
week is devoted to hearing law cases, which
are thus brought before him. He has remov-
ed several of the under judges who have
been proved guilty of bribery or injustice
of any kind, while he is himself a terror to
evil doers, and universally praised by those
who do well.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is one remarkable feature of the
law cases in Siam not generally known.
Whenever a case is entered in court, both
plaintiff and defendant have to go and stay
there till the case is decided. It is done
in order that each one shall act as a guard
to the other, for fear he may go and get
counsel that will be unfavorable to the other
party. A Siamese friend told me that he
once had to spend a year thus, away from
his family and business in a case where
forty ticals were involved. They may go
away during the day providing they mut-
ually consent to do so and both go togeth-
er. It occurred to me that this feature of
their jurisprudence might be well adopted
into other countries. I am sure that in
countries when time is money, and the face
of ones antagonist not the most pleasant
object to behold, the ardor of some who
are so fond of litigation would be cooled
down by such a custom.{{< /news/text >}}

China.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The events of the fortnight have again
been important. and have continued adverse
to the Imperial arms.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The victory gained by the Nien-fei, over
the army commanded by San ko-lin-sin,
when this generalissimo lost his life, must
have resulted in a complete route of the
Imperial troops, for his body was lost, and
all obstruction to the progress of the in-
surgents, swept away—at least, so far as
is known.... The last advices state that the
insurgents had captured, and sacked the
city of Chefoo-shien in the Province of
Shantung, celebrated as having been the
birth-place of Confucius.... The Mandarins
report runs to the effect that the insurgents
sacked the place, destroying all that has
been constructed during many centuries in
honor of the sage. This report is probably
untrue and may have been spread to excite
the people who hold, as a rule, the memory
of Confucius in the greatest reverence.
However that may be, there seems no reason
To doubt the fall of the town which would
place the insurgents close to the Province
of Chih Li, within about one hundred miles
from Tientsin.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The utmost alarm prevails, both at the
Capital and at Tientsin. The cry seems
to be for Foreign aid. The disciplined
troops which were quartered near Soochow,
and which have lately occupied so much of
the care and solicitude of the ex-Futai Li,
have at length been hurried up by foreign
steamers, to the Peiho. This force con-
sists of about seven thousand troops includ-
ing two corps of artillery, and besides
having some well tried foreign officers, has
all the Chinese veterans who served under
Ward, Hope, Burgevine, Stavely, Gordon,
and the ex-Footai Li. If this force be in the
efficient state represented, there can be
little doubt it will scatter the Nien-fei with
the utmost facility.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Tseng-kwo-fan left Nanking on the 8th
inst, to take command of the army in
Shantung, and Li the ex-Footai. left Soo-
chow on the 11th idem for Nanking to take
the seals as Governor General of the Two
Kiang. It does not appear that the Tient-
sin authorities, at date of last advices, were
aware of the coming of the disciplined
troops from Shanghai. They had unden-
gone a certain amount of drill instruction
at the hands of the British troops who have
occupied the Taku forts for some time.
These were sent to intercept the path of
the Nien fei under charge of the Chinese
Superintendent of Trade, who induced the
Commissioner of Foreign Customs at
Tientsin to accompany him. Application
is understood to have been made to the
British Minister to allow the officer in
charge of the few British troops for the
Taku forts, to proceed to the scene of ac-
tion, and rumour has it that the request
had been granted{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The four thousand native drilled troops
just referred to have never seen any ser-
vice, and it is greatly doubted if any re-
liance can be placed upon them; They
refused to proceed after having started, and
some of their number had to be decapitat-
ed by way of intimidating the others.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is also stated in quarters likely to be
well informed, that Prince Kung had sent
an urgent order to Shanghai, desiring Mr.
Hart, the Inspector General of Customs,
to repair to Peking without loss of time;
and it is certain that that officer did proceed
thither on the 20th inst. It is stated on
what should be good authority, that the
Imperial government were not aware of the
existence of this effective disciplined force
at Shanghai. It was of course known that
a camp of instruction had been established
there, but it was supposed denuded by the
expedition sent to Funkien, that no more
force remained than was necessary to pro-
ceed to Shanghai. It is added that Mr. Hart
caused this force to be moved to the Peiho
and this statement, derives corroboration
from the report that the ex-Footai Li has
applied to take command of it, on the
ground that the city of Nanking was too
important a post to be vacated by Tseng-
kwo fan. Mr Hart knows well how im-
practicable a man Tseng is, and as Li has
had much experience in foreign military
affairs, and besides has been for some time
in constant communication with Mr. Hart
it is natural that the latter should desire
to see him at the head of the force on which
the safety of the Empire apparently de-
pends.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Hart's present position is a most
singular one. He was second to Mr. Lay
on the Foreign Customs Inspectorate, be-
ing established and it is entirely through
him that the institution has survived. He
is a most efficient officer, and notwithstand-
ing the odium which the China Customs
has drawn upon itself, he has always re-
tained the respect of the foreign commun-
ity, and at the same time enjoyed the full
confidence of the Mandarins. His sin-
gleness of purpose, his application to busi-
ness, his circumspection, tact, and talents
are really extraordinary. It is fact which
is not generally known, that the flotilla
scheme of which Mr. Lay and Capt. Os-
borne made such a sad bungle, was an
arrangement concluded between Prince
hung and Mr. Hart, who simply wanted
the vessels to do as they pleased with Mr.
Hart out of courtesy, employed Mr. Lay,
who was absent at the time in England,
and the affair fell to grief because of the
high ambitious flight which that individual
described in connexion with it. Still Mr.
Hart's conduct was so straightforward, that
notwithstanding the withdrawal of the ves-
sels after their arrival, he retained the
confidence of Prince Kung.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would now appear as if the fate of
the dynasty were in his hands, and it is
very probably the fact that he is relied on
for council and advice, not only as to how
to repel the insurgents, but also as to
frustrating the machinations of the differ-
ent factions who are scheming for their
own aggrandisement, at the risk of the
Empire.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are still no certain tidings as to
the movements of the Taipings in the
province of Fuhkien. They appear to be
South of the Tea districts, and have not
interfered as yet, either with the mani-
pulation of the leaf, or the transit. A
rumour was current to the effect that they
hand recaptured Changchow, but this can-
not be true. It seems certain however
that they have captured a prefectural city
of some note, either near the borders, or
within the limits of the adjoining province
of Kwangtung: and it is equally certain
that there is no imperial force in the field
of sufficient strength to cope with them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Baron de Meritens, Commissioner
of Customs at Foochow, is busily engaged
organising a Chinese disciplined force. He
has acquired the services of a number of
French drill-instructors, and has obtained
a quantity of arms and munitions from the
military authorities of this colony. His
intentions are doubtless praiseworthy, but
in teaching the Mandarins to lean on him
for support and not to trust to themselves,
he is simply perpetuating the baneful policy
which has encouraged that spirit of apathy
and fatalism, which has allowed matters to
drift into their present sad state.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A General called Pao Chao had a com-
mand on the Yangtsse embracing Kow-
kiang and Hankow-—which command con-
sisted of fourteen camps. In the last issue
but one of this Report some particular
were given of the mutiny of one of these
camps. It is now stated that eleven of the
other camps have mutined and have form-
ed themselves into predatory hordes—
two camps only remaining loyal.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The new Order in Council for the Gov-
ernment of British subjects in China, dated
9th March, has been published in the Ga-
zette of this Colony. It will not come in
to force until one month after it shall have
been promulgated by the British Consul
at Shanghai. It superseded all the laws
hitherto in force and contains several vast
improvements. For instance, all British
subjects residing in China must register
themselves once a year at the Consulate
under whose jurisdiction they may be—-
otherwise they will be excluded from all
the advantages of ex-territoriality. Again,
no British subject can aid and abet either
the Imperial Government in putting down
rebellion, or insurgents in revolt against
the government, without being guilty of a
misdemeanor—unless he shall possess the
Queen's license, the proof whereof will rest
on the party accused.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is fortunate for the Mandarins that
some delay is likely to ensue in this Or-
der in Council coming into effect, as at the
present juncture, many British subjects
are serving in the Imperial ranks. When
the Order does come into force, British
policy will become entirely changed in
consequence of interference being prohibi-
ted. If Commissioners of Customs are to
be fighting men. Customs patronage will
doubtless all revert to the French, who
have a most irrepressible penchant for
fighting the Taipings in a manner which
secures both glory and profit. It does not
appear clear however how the new law is
to be put in motion, and if as the Attorney
General in the House of Commons distinct-
ly implied, the Consuls in China can pro-
secute or not as they may please,—-they
will of course be guided by the wishes of
the British Minister, who will of course
direct the action of the law so as to carry
out his political ends or personal feelings.
This view of the case is the more alarming
seeing the perfect futility of appeal under
the present administration. It may safely
be said, that during the terin of office
of the present Ministry, British affairs in
China have been conducted in an extreme-
ely oppressive and questionable manner,
and yet on no occasion probably has an ap-
peal or a remonstrance met with anything
but official repellence; so much so, that
injustice is now submitted to as a matter
of course and there is a great lack of con-
fidence in British authority.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To assist the Imperial Government, the
local authorities of this colony, acting un-
der orders from home, prohibited by Pro-
clamation the export of arms and munitions
except under a Mandarin pass or certifi-
cate. The neighbouring colony of Macao
derived considerable benefit from this pro-
hibition, and the Canton Mandarins opened
an office for the sale of the required pas-
ses to any foreigner whom it suited to ap-
ply for them. The matter at last became
so absurd. that the local authorities, after
representation, obtained instructions to re-
scind the prohibition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Large quantities of New Silk and Tea
have been settled since the departure of
last mail. Still trade is generally dull, es-
pecially in-so-far as shipping is concerned.
Exchange, strange to say, has tended down.
No more failures have been announced
here.{{< /news/text >}}

The Karennees.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The term Karenne in plain English, is
Red Karen. The affix nee is a Burman
word and signifies red. According to Dr.
Mason, and no man has studied the subject
more persistently and thoroughly than he
has, the great Karen family found in
Burnah, are divided into four principal
Tribes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/table >}}
<tr>
 <td>1. Sgaw Tribes.</td>
 <td>2. Rghai Tribes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>3. Pwo Tribes.</td>
 <td>4. Shaw Karens.</td>
</tr>
{{< /news/table >}}
{{< news/text >}}All the Karens are susceptible of being
grouped into these four grand divisions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}but each division is again split up into
several little clans. each living under the
authority of its own chief. Without
knowing any reason for that practice, the
Burmese simply distinguish the Karens,
as Burman Karens, or Pwo, and Taline
Karens or Sgaas. The dominant race has
never taken any trouble to make a more
minute division. They sometimes use the
word Ayeing, which means Wild, and
there they leave the definition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Along the whole of our North east
frontier of British Burmah, we find the
Karens located in considerable numbers.
The country called Karennee stretches a-
long for two or three hundred miles, and
is inhabited by Red Karens, White Ka-
rens, Shan Karens, and other tribes. A
range of mountains broken and dislocated
into separate masses, seems to divide Ka-
rennee into two sections, one called East-
ern Karonnee, and the other Western
Karonnee. The clans occupying the West-
ern section of that territory are ruled by
thirteen different chiefs, though they all
owe a nominal allegiance to one who goes
by the name of "Kyay hpoqyce" This
very venerable chief is the most influential
Karen in Western Karonnee. His re-
sidence is at a town called Kyelah. He
has two sons, Koon Tha, and Koon Sha,
who have also a great deal of influence
among that people. The Eastern and
Western Karens appear to have had an
immemorial feud existing between them.
They have never been exactly at peace
with each other. The western Karens are
as friendly toward the British Government
and their subjects, as the Eastern ones are
hostile and treacherous toward our people,
as would be the most ferocious of savages.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the cold season of 1863. 4, that dis-
tinguished Civil officer of Government, the
late Edward O'Riley, Esquire, was deput-
ed by the Local Government on a friendly
Mission to these Karen tribes. After a
journey of sixteen days from Shooy gheyeen,
ascending and descending ranges of moun-
tains, over which it would be impossible to
conduct a tramway, Mr. O'Riley reached
the town of Kyekah in which resided the
Karen Patriarch Kyay hpo gyee. As soon
as it was announced that Mr. O'Riley was
on his way, the old Karen Chief sent out
a party with supplies for his followers and
to escort him, with honor to the town.
The meeting between the two friends, whose
acquaintance extended over a period of
seven years, (and they had performed the
ceremony of the "Titeesa," or the bond of
friendship), was most affecting. Civilization
and Savagery literally embraced each
other, as they met on that mountain home.
All the subordinate Chiefs were summoned
to Kyelah to meet the British Officer, who
had been so long their proved friend.
Thirteen attended. Warm and earnest
were the protestations of friendship. The
Shan traders were protected, on their
journey every year from the Shan states
to Maulmain.    Never once had they been
attacked by the western Karens since they
promised in 1857 not to molest them. They
had kept their word inviolate, and they
appealed to the Shans themselves for proof.
"Yes" replied the traders, "we are always
protected in western Karenne, but are rob-
bed and plundered and murdered in the
Eastern section of the territory.  These
people are our friends, but those are out
enemies"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After spending six weeks at Kyaypho-
gyee's town, and renewing the bonds of
peace and amity between, these wild people
and our Government, Mr. O'Riley proceeded
on his mission to Eastern Karennee, in
the hope of meeting with similar success.
Disappointment however, attended his
efforts on this part of his Mission. The
principal village or town in Easter Karen-
nee is a place called "Tsan lupan," where
till lately the Chief of Eastern Karennee
resided. He went by the name of Pah poo,
and was well known all up the Salween
river. Recently Pah poo, had died and
his authority had passed to two of his sons,
who were inexperienced youngmen, con-
trolled by the influence of their mother, one
Maiteen-tanee, who in the opinion of Mr
O'Riley was far the most influential person
in that part of Karennee.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But it is clear that after, the old Chief
Pahpoo's death, power appeared to repose
in no particular hands. Hence our tim-
ber cutters, traders and Shan visitors were
attacked by bands of dacoits, who sprung
up in Eastern Karennee, and were a mix-
ture of Burmese, Shans and Karen dacoits.
acting under the direction of a leader styled
Menlong, or the embryo king. As all
political imposters fear the power of the
British Government, since Captain Lloyd
promptly put down an attempt at rebellion
in the Toungoo district, in the year 1859,
for which he deserved the Victoria Cross
our frontier has become too hot for these
aspirants for the kingly office. They keep
at a respectable distance beyond our boun-
dary, because they know, that five yards
of rope will be the treat they will receive
in case they are caught. Two years
ago, another Menlong was swung up at
Rangoon for creating a rebellion in the
Pegu district. The Martaban Menloung
is the man, who opposed Mr. O’Riley’s
reception in the Eastern Karennee State,
when he was proceeding on a mission of
peace and friendship with all the Karen.
tribes in that part of the country. The
robberies and dacoities to which our sub-
jects are exposed while traveling through
that section of the Red Karen country are
owing in part to the want of all proper
authority and to machinations of the Bur-
mese impostor, who would like to be a king,
but is unable to find a vacant throne for
himself. For sometime Mr. O'Riley was
exposed to considerable risk, but by firm-
ness and good judgment he was enabled to
withdraw from a difficulty which appeared
to threaten his life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hope to return to his interesting
topic of the late Mr. O'Riley's mission to
Karennee on an early day.{{< /news/text >}}

The Funeral Cortege.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such a funeral as that of the late Presid-
ent Lincoln has, perhaps, never been wit-
nessed before in the world's history. All
the pageants got up by wealth in honour
of dead kings, dwindle into insignificance
in comparison with it. At Washington,
the scene of the fatal catastrophe, the cere-
monies were very imposing, the whole
population participating in it, as well as the
foreign diplomatic corps. In Baltimore,
on the arrival of the body, the scene was
renewed, and the crowd of still and solemn
spectators far greater. At Harrisburg, the
capital of Pennsylvania, although the weath-
er had become unfavourable, eager thou-
sands paid their last respects to the
honoured dead. In Philadelphia, hundreds
of thousands lined the streets through
which the procession passed. The proces-
sion itself, composed of civilians, societies,
professional men, soldiers and sailors, was
grand, solemn, and effective. The scenes
for two days were indescribable. New
York, first in population, was moved to its
very heart, and nothing was spared to make
the occasion one of great impressiveness.
The funeral honours were to be repeated
in Albany, Buffalo, Chicago, and Spring-
field, where the body is to repose. At all
intermediate towns through which the
body passed, the whole population spon-
taneously rendered honours to the dead.
A large volume would not be adequate to
particularize and describe all the details.
The general effect of these remarkable
funeral ceremonies has been good. The
minds of the people have, to an annual
degree, been solemnized, and if permanent
advantage does not result, it will be our
crime. 'We should learn, from such an
event, to honour our God-appointed magis-
trates and rulers, to love our country more
dearly, to abhor sin more profoundly, and
to stand in awe of the Divine judgments.{{< /news/text >}}

Capture of Jeff. Davis.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lieut.-Col. Harden, commanding the
First Wisconsin, has just arrived from Ir-
winsville. He struck the trail of Davis at
Dublin, Laurens County, on the evening of
the 7th, and followed him closely night and
day through the pine wilderness of Alliga-
tor Creek and Green Swamps, via Cumber-
landville to Irwinsville.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At Cumberlandville Col. Harden met
Col. Pritchard, with 150 picked men and
horses of the Fourth Michigan.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Harden followed the trail directly south,
while Pritchard, having fresher horses,
pushed down the Ocmulgee toward Hope-
well, and thence by House Creek to Irwins-
ville, arriving there at midnight of the 9th.
Jeff. Davis had not arrived.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From a citizen Pritchard learned that
his party were encamped two miles out of
the town. He made dispositions of his men
and surrounded the camp before day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Harden had camped at 9 P. M. within
two miles, as he afterward learned, from
Davis.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The trail being too indistinct to follow,
he pushed on at 3 A. M., and had gone but
little more than one mile, when his advance
was fired upon by men of the Fourth Michi-
gan.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A fight ensued, both parties exhibiting
the greatest determination. Fifteen minutes
elapsed before the mistake was discovered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The firing in this skirmish was the first
warning that Davis received.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The captors report that he hastily put on
one of his wife's dresses and started for the
woods, closely followed by our men, who at
first thought him a woman, but seeing his
boots while he was running, they suspected
his sex at once.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The race was a short one, and the rebel
President was soon brought to bay. He
brandished a bowie-knife and showed signs
of battle, but yielded promptly to the per-
