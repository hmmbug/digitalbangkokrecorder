BANGKOK FEBRUARY 15TH
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It appears that His Majesty the Supreme
King is some-what interested in the oil
question. The reference of our correspon-
dent in a former issue to the oil regions in
some parts of the United States, and the
suggestion that oil might possibly be found
in Siam, has excited a desire in the mind
of His Majesty to have some one who un-
derstands the business, explore the country
and point out where oil may be found.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We publish in another column a note
from His Majesty upon this subject, which
although evidently a little tinctured with
irony shows that His Majesty does not
object to any enterprise which tends to
develope the resources of the country pro-
viding it does not delve too deeply into
the Royal treasury.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whether our correspondent can give any
additional information upon the oil question
remains to be seen. His Majesty complains
that many foreigners would try to induce
the Siamese, to enter into many things at
great expense, which they think would be
of no advantage to them. We suppose it
would be difficult to accept all the pro-
posals made to the Siamese by Europeans
and it will require the exercise of judge-
ment to choose those which will be really
useful, but we are sorry that His Majesty
thinks that his people are not yet in a con-
dition to appreciate railroads and tele-
graphs. He thinks the iron rails and
telegraph wires, would be too great a
temptation to their thieving propensities.
We trust however that the day is not far
distant when the countries north will be
thoroughly explored and the facilities of-
fered for trade will be such as to induce
foreign capitalists to undertake the con-
struction of railroads and telegraphs even
here.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some of the most extensive railroads in
the United States are owned by European
capitalists and English capitalists are also
engaging extensively in the oil business in
the United States. It is but recently that
the thought was conceived of connecting
the Eastern and Western hemispheres by
telegraph, yet there is but a comparatively
short link wanting in the great chain which
will connect Siam with Europe and event-
ually with America.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}May we not then look for the time, when
this link will be completed, and when we
shall converse daily with our antipodes. May
we not also look for the time when the
cars loaded with freight and passengers, will
roll their ponderous wheels between this
and the great Celestial empire, and even
between different portions of this kingdom.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
THE CITY OF DIAMONDS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE BANGKOK,
RECORDER.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dear Sir— The monotony of our quiet
life in this rural city, has been again some-
what interrupted, during the past week, by
the arrival of another visitor, though not a
royal one this time, with whose face we
hope to become familiar in the future, and
to whose visits we shall look for something,
to please and instruct. We would welcome
the Bangkok Recorder to our fireside, if we
had one; as it is, we will give it an honor-
able place on our table, and trust that it has
before it, a career of usefulness and honor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the ends at which you aim, is the
dissemination of reliable information abroad
in reference to Siam, the development of
its resources, stimulating to activity the
dormant mental powers of this people, elev-
ating their moral standards, encouraging
their trade, and agriculture, everything in
fact which will tend to the mental, moral
and religious training of the numerous races
have assembled. You have a boundless
field before you, that promises to repay
well, the labor and toil of its cultivation.
By paying I do not mean any very great
pecuniary profits suddenly to he derived,
hut the pleasure of seeing all of these ends
and others, gradually and surely, though it
may he slowly, accomplished. It is I think an
auspicious time for the advent of journalism.
Every thing is in a formative state. Old
Siam, is passing away, or is at least awaken-
ing from her long dark slumber of seclusion,
ignorance, and superstition. Young Siam,
can never again be what the old was. It
has much to gain yet, as immense distance
to go over, before it can claim to be in point
of intelligence, literature, science, and reli-
gion, what the Western nations are.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the light has broken in. Old and
cherished customs have been broken up.
This is a great deal in the East where cus-
tom is law and reigns supreme. It is just
now at that stage where a few years may
equal so many centuries at other times.
More changes have taken place in the last
decade of years than had been made in a
century previous. The next will probably
witness no less, it may be much greater and
more astonishing ones.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That Siam possesses more than its intrin-
sic importance, a glance at the map with
any knowledge of its history for a few years
will show. Trade, which in other countries
is the growth of centuries, has sprung up as
a mushroom in a day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is not merely its population of six or
seven millions that invests it with such im-
portance. You may cut off several times
that numbor from China, or India, and in
themselves they would not possess any of
that interest which Siam holds in the civil-
ized world. There is much in the geo-
graphical position which a country occupies.
It has not always been the largest of the
most populous countries, that have exerted
most influence in the world's progress. The
influence of Palestine, will be felt when that
of Egypt, and Assyria, will have passed
away.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Greece will live in her poets, orators, his-
torians, and philosophers, while the Medes,
and Persians, have left but little to impress
the world, but the mere report of their
numbers. While in later periods, an island
far less than Siam, governs the most po-
pulous portions of the earth. The geo-
graphical position in all of these cases, and
many others that might he mentioned, con-
tribnted not a little to their greatness. A
position sufficiently isolated to enable it to
work out its own problem of government,
and yet sufficiently accessible to the other
nations, to make its influence felt, seems on
the whole most desirable. Siam, has some-
what such a position. It is situated a little
distant from the great thoroughfare of the
nations. It is not a Gibraltar, to make its
acquisition a necessity to some of the great
powers, and an object of jealousy to the
others. Yet when it shall throw of the
shackles that bind it down, that will forever
prevent its taking a front position among
the nations of the earth,—when it shall em-
brace not only a liberal policy of government,
but a true and elevating system of religion,
which would of itself encourage and develope
literature, science and the arts,—when the
millions of money now spent in the support
of polygamy, and idolatry shall be devoted
to schools and colleges, and churches, and
canals, and railroads, and telegraphs, it will
be sufficiently near the great outside world,
to give it an influence for good. Were its
present rulers, who have done so much for
it already,—only awakened to the respon-
sibility of their station, they could make it
the pride and the admiration of Christen-
dom, while they would thereby at the same
time, establish their own power on a per-
manent basis. Such a result however, is pro-
bably more than can be hoped for. Yet it is
worth of the United labor of all who have
taken up their residence here. Every class
of representatives from christian nations,
consuls and physicians, missionaries and mer-
chants and seamen have it in their power, to
do some thing towards hastening such a
result. But in whatever place may be assign-
ed to others, you may, Mr. Editor, without
boasting, claim a position inferior to none
unless the history of the past is all belied.
In reference to Siam, the press must have
an important place in its elevation, and
progress. I trust your most ardent hopes
of usefulness, may be realized in your new
position. I intended when I commenced, to
say something about one race that forms no
inconsiderable portion of the population of
this country, whose province, in the north,
is one of the most important in his Majesty’s
dominions, and concerning whom but little
is known abroad. Having dwelt so long
on other subjects, I must defer any account
of the Laos, and a tour taken to their coun-
try, to another time.{{< /news/text >}}

Yours &c.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
FROM NEW YORK CORRESPONDENCE OF
LONDON DAILY NEW
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
NEW YORK Nov. 8th.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}You may remember that two months ago
I informed you that the probabilities were
that Lincoln would carry all the Northern
States but three, and these I set down as
Maryland, Kentucky, and New Jersey. I
have proved right as to the number, though
wrong as to the particular States. Mary-
land has not voted for General Mc. Clellan,
but Delaware has, while the result in New
Jersey and Kentucky has been what I anti-
cipated. The general issue of the elcetion
i that twenty one out of twenty four States
have voted for Lincoln, the "preponder-
ating section" of the Northern people,
which according to the Times had conclu-
ded that "the war was a failure," and ought
to be abandoned, consisting of the majority
in three States, two of which are slave
States, and one of them, Delaware, the
smallest in the Union. The policy of pro-
secuting the war for the purpose of reducing
the South to subjection, and destroying
slavery - of which Mr. Lincoln is the cham-
pion - has, therefore, received the most
emphatic confirmation which it is in the
power of the country to bestow on it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He is the sixth President who has en-
joyed the honor of re-election, Washington
being one; and has achieved a triumph, as
regards the extent of his majority, such as
has fallen to the lot of none of his prede-
cessors since the election of Monroe in 1820.
I think I may safely say that this has justi-
fied, all that I have ever ventured to assert
in your columns as to the strength of the
determination, on the part of the Northern
people, to continue the contest to the last
extremity. For it must be remembered,
that Lincoln, owes no part of his success to
what the democrats call the "bogus States,"
meaning those States which are held by
military force, though nominally within the
Union. Louisiana, and Arkansas have not
voted, and Kentucky gave 20,000 majority
against him. The verdict which has been
rendered is emphatically that of the people
of the free States. And it cannot be said,
either, that it has been due to an outburst of
unreasoning enthusiasm. The war has now
lasted four years, and though great successes
have been achieved, the end is still distant.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The loss of life has been very great; the
drain on the population of the Western
States has been very heavy; the public debt
which has accumulated is enormous, and is
the burden of taxation; and the depreca-
tion of the currency, presses with pecular
severity upon the poor, and on persons with
fixed incomes. Every body is now per-
fectly familiar with the difficulties of the
struggle, and there is now few outside the
great towns who have not suffered from it,
either in mind, body, or estate. So that
the decision which was rendered on last
Tuesday must have been dictated by calm
and deliberate resolve, must have come from
men who had counted the cost and were
willing to bear it. As I have often said
before, the Northern people may be infat-
uated about the matter: it may be that the
enterprise in which they engaged is a
hopeless one; but it is of the last import-
ance that Englishmen should clearly under-
stand that they are in earnest, and that
peace will come, whenever it does come,
either from the submission of the South, or
the exhaustion of the free States.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From their weariness or despair it will,
in my opinion, never come. And I think
what has just occurred is a curious com-
mentary, too, on opinions generally preva-
lent in aristocratic countries as to the fick-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}leness of democracy, and its blindness or
indifference to the remote consequences of
its acts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Very few have voted for Lincoln who
were not impelled to it by what they saw,
or thought they saw, in the far distant future,
by the consideration of the propable effect
of a dissolution of the Union on the honor
and welfare of their children and their
children's children. Of the Immediate ad-
vantages that would flow from peace every
body is aware ; but to the evil consequences
that would ultimately flow from it every
body is also alive. I think the great ma-
jority of the Northern people are anxious
to fight on new, in some degree from a re-
gard for the national honor, but in a still
greater degree because they believe that
the recognition of the confederacy would
lead, sooner or later, to the further division
of the union, to the establishment of several
small States, and consequently, to long and
incessant were, if for nothing else, for the
preservation of that "balances of power"
for which European statesman have been
fighting for five hundred years, and which
they never seem to succeed in permanently
establishing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The election passed off, in spite of the
anticipation to the contrary, with perfect
quiet. Up to the hour of the closing of the
last mail the city, as I told you had a Sun-
day look. I walked about the streets during
the evening, and was struck by the silence
that seemed to reign every where, and yet
not a uniform except that of the police was
visible all day long. But the troops were
on board Steamers in the river, ready to be
thrown ashore at any point at which a dis-
turbance might occur, and the knowledge
of theis fact no doubt had a salutary influence
on the roughs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}About nine o'clock I went to Tammany
Hall, the head quarters of the democracy,
in which it has for forty or fifty years, been
their wont to assemble on the evening of
election day, and hear the returns read, and
listen to the spouting of their favorite ora-
tors. When I arrived I found a stream
descending the stairway quite as large as
that which was ascending, and from their
looks concluded that the news which was
coming in was not considered favorable.
The hall was densely packed by a moat un-
savory crowd, not by any means so dirty
or ill dressed as a London audience of the
same class, but decidedly ruffianly in ap-
pearance and a large propotion evidently
Irish.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The lights burned dimly through the
thick clouds of tobacco smoke, and there
was a strong smell of whiskey. "Captain"
Bynoers, a mob leader of great reputation
and influence, who is the old times, before
the establishment of the city police, was
in the habit of controling the elections in
many wards of the city, by sending his
followers round to the polls, to break the
heads of all voters of the opposite party,
who attempted to approach them, was ad-
dressing the meeting. He is an American,
of strong and rather coarse features, and
though well dressed, had reduced himself
to democratic trim by unbuttoning his
waistcoat, taking off his cravat, and unbut-
toning his shirt front, and during the pro-
cess of his discourse gave his face, neck,
and shoulders a vigorous rubbing with a
dirty pocket handkerchief. He was evid-
ently not in good spirits, and was occupied
in preparing his hearers for a disappoint-
ment. But this roused them to will, and
was very powerful and fierce in suppressing
all interruptions which were not of a com-
plimentary nature, by threatening to "settle
with" the persons making them. When
I succeeded in getting a foot-hold on a bench
where I could see and hear him, he was
engaged in accusing the republican party
of an intention to persecute the catholics as
soon as they had subjugated the slavehold-
ers, and brought down roars of applause
by his denunciations of what he called "re-
ligious intolerance." From this he passed
rapidly to abuse of the negro, and occupied
himself in it during the remainder of my
stay—nearly half an hour—and anything
so ribald and disgusting I have never heard
in a public assemblage. He rang the changes
for twenty minutes on the smell of the ne-
groes, and on their lips, nose, and
"wool," and interspersed it all with denun-
ciations of the "miscogenators," recurring
incessantly to the passion which he ascrib-
ed to the republican leaders for "nigger
wenches." To the Irish he was very com-
plimentary, and the accent in which most
of the plaudits were uttered showed that
the greater part of his audience were of that
nation. One joke, which he repeated se-
veral times, invariably brought down the
house. It consisted in speaking of some
body as a "Frenchman who, from his name,
must have been born in Paris, for it was
"Micky McGuinness" or 'Pat Reilly.' "
Neither the election returns, however, nor
his comments on them, were of a nature to
keep up the spirits of his audience, and be-
fore I left, it had grown very thin.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}John Brown’s body is mouldering in the grave,

{{< news/indent1 >}}But his soul is marching on—

{{< news/text >}}There was another democratic gathering
of the same kind at Mozart-hall, in which
the followers of Fernando Wood, or, as they
call him, "Fernando Wud," met for a similar
purpose, but as it was in no respect different
from that at Tammany-hall. I did not think
it worth while to visit it. The republicans
had engaged the large hall of the Cooper
Institute, the largest room in New York,
accommodating, I believe, between three
and four thousand persons, had procured a
band of music, and had the telegraphic
wires brought on to the platform, so that
the returns might be read as they arrived.
When I reached the place it was densely
crowded, and there was a large gathering
outside, waiting for news, and taking up
the cheering that was heard in the inside.
I do not think I ever saw a more enthusias-
tic meeting, and the cheering was such as
one hardly ever hears under a roof. When
the despatch was read announcing that
"Glorious Old Massachusetts" as the chair-
man called it, had given 60,000 majority
for Lincoln, the whole audience rose and
gave three cheers and “ one cheer more,”
waving their hats, and large numbers stand-
ing on the benches in order to give greater
range to their shouts. And the difference
between their appearance and that of the
crowd at Tammany-hall was in itself a com-
plete commentary on New York politics.
The men before me here plainly belonged
to the flower of the native population. They
were all well dressed and clean, and a large
proportion bore evident marks of New Eng-
land origin and training. The high, though
rather narrow foreheads, regular and well-
cut, but rather sharp features, bright but
rather cold eyes, the quick, eager look, and
nervous gestures, all told more plainly than
words could tell that a large proportion of
them had been born or bred on Yankee soil.
And if one had any doubt about it, it would
have been removed by the way in which
all the New England news was received.
I don’t think I ever saw such a burst of
enthusiasm as followed the announcement
that the Massachusetts majority was not
60,000, but 75,000. Some elderly men
near me had their eyes filled with tears.
Every mention of the names of Grant, or
Sherman, or Farragut, brought down the
house, no matter how often repeated. In
one of the intervals of the speaking, the
band was called on for "Yankee Doodle,"
and there being some delay in commencing
it, a number of persons—two or three
hundred I should think—began to whistle
the air, and whistled it through—finishing
amidst tremendous applause. The time
passed thus, speaking, cheering, and hearing
the telegraphic returns read till near 1
o’clock, apparently without the slightest
diminution of the excitement, when there
followed a scene such as has, perhaps, never
been witnessed at a political meeting.
Lincoln's election was now certain, and the
chairman requested the band to play the
"Old Hundred," which name one has not
aptly called the "Puritan war song," and
the audience rose and sang the psalm in
full chorus, and then broke up, large num-
bers singing "John Brown" as they went
out :
a rather doggrel ditty, originating with the
abolitionists at the outset of the war, but
since adopted by the army, and in fact by
the whole North, as a sort of war song.
The air is fine, though simple, and the
words have enough of the hymns about them
to mingling a religious fervour with the
political enthusiasm which they excite.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}entertainment, as I have received all the kindness
which has welcomed me here, with feelings at once
of pleasure and embarrassment; of pleasure at feel-
ing that an Englishman who, like you, loves liberty
and social justice, has in America a second home;
of embarrassment, and almost of shame, when I
think how little I can possibly have done to merit
such attentions. If a mere writer could ever have
been led by this kind welcome to over-estimate his
own services, such feelings would have been banish-
ed from my mind when I was present at a soldier's
funeral and now borne past me the body of one who
has given to this cause not mere words of sympathy,
but a young, promising, and happy life. I was not
even among the last to perceive the claims of your
cause upon our sympathies, though, from the time
when it came clear out of the mists which at first
surrounded it, as the cause not only of your territo-
rial greatness but of humanity and civilization, and
brought out the nobler part of the national charact-
er, which to the eye of distant spectators had been
at first obscured, it has received the deep and un-
wavering allegiance of my heart. On all grounds,
then, I accept this honour, not for myself, but for
the great party in England of which I am an ad-
herent, and which has followed you with its good
wishes through this great struggle. Would that
Cobden or Bright were here in my place to represent
your English friends more worthily, and to acknow-
ledge this tribute in better words than my unprac-
tised tongue can command. In truth, little gratitude
is due from you to any English liberal who has
raised his voice in support of this cause. It is our
cause as well as yours. Our hopes of political pro-
gress have sunk with your calamities. They will
revive with your victories; they will revive with
your victories over your enemies in the field; they
will revive still more with your moral victories at
home. The tidings are now on their way to Eng-
land for which English liberals have been waiting
with intense anxiety, and which will fill their hearts
with gratitude, joy, and renewed hope. This great
triumph—this great ratification of the principles
for which you have done and suffered so much, and
on which your common wealth is founded—will
cause almost as much exultation in England as it is
causing here. I came here purely in pursuance of
my vocation as a student of history, to verify the
theory which I had formed. I came to see whether
the progress of humanity, which I had learned to
trace through all the ages, and believed to be per-
petual, had been arrested here. I shall return con-
vinced that it has not been arrested. I was told
that my visit to America would modify my liberal
opinions. In a certain sense I own they have been
modified. Till I came here I was—not a revolutionist,
for no man can more heartily abhor violent revolu-
tions—but somewhat impatient of political evils,
and anxious for vehement effort and for immediate
change. I shall return with my impatience allayed
by a calm assurance of the future. You will suc-
ceed in your great experiment, and we shall in the
end feel, in the solution of our political problems,
the beneficent effects of your success. I came also
to see a great political crisis. Would that all those
who love and all those who mistrust free institutions,
could have seen it also! Would that they could
have witnessed as I have the majestic calmness
with which, under circumstances the most perilous
and exciting, the national decision has been pro-
nounced. Here is no anarchy, no military dictator-
ship. In the midst of civil war a civilian is re-elect-
ed as President by a constitutional process as tran-
quil as an English Sabbath day. And no king is
more secure in the allegiance of his subjects than is
the President in the allegiance of all—even those
who voted against him—beneath his elective rule.
I would, too, that the English people could witness
as I witness the spirit of humanity which returns
its power over all the passions of civil war, not-
withstanding the greatest provocations; and the
absence, which has most forcibly struck me during
my residence here, of any bloodthirsty sentiment
or any feeling of malignant hatred towards those
who are now your antagonists in a civil war, but
whom, when they shall have submitted to the law,
you will again eagerly welcome as fellow-citizens,
and receive into the full communion of the free.
Many a prejudice, many an error would be dispell-
ed, many harsh judgment would be cancelled, many
a bitter word recalled, if only my countrymen
could behold with their own eyes what I have be-
held and now behold. I will on this occasion dwell
on the present state of feeling in England towards
this country. You know by this time that we are
not, as a section of our press would represent us to
be, united in sympathy with your enemies, but that
in this as on other political questions we are divid-
ed among ourselves, and that the mass of our peo-
ple are on your side. Mr. Ward Beecher, who is
here present, must have sufficiently assured you of
this fact. But I cannot omit on any occasion, least
of all on this occasion and in this city, to protest
that all Englishmen who have any regard for the
honour of England, or even for her real interest as
a commercial nation, reprobate and abhor the con-
duct of those shipbuilders and merchants of Liver-
pool whose ignoble cupidity, regardless alike of
public morality and of the welfare of their country,
has brought the two nations to the verge of a deso-
lating war. No part of the address which Mr. Jay
has read finds a more cordial response in my heart,
or will find a more cordial response in hearts of my
friends, than that which promises future goodwill
and peace between England and America. One
great cause of our transient estrangement has been
removed, as Mr. Jay has most truly remarked,
since the slave owner has ceased to fill your councils
with his tyrannical spirit, and to inflame the animo-
sity of your people against a nation which with all
her shortcomings and with all her faults, has been
the sincere, constant, and active enemy of slavery.
In the councils of England too - at least in the gen-
eral sentiment of our nation - a change favourable
to the continuance of friendly relations with your
country will not fail to ensue when, the alien born
of slavery having disappeared, your institutions
shall stand forth in their true lineaments and na-
tive character, as the first attempt in the history of
the world to found a great community on the prin-
ciples, on which alone a community worthy of the
name can be founded, of common interest and equal
right. Your cause, as I said before, is ours; it is
the cause of the whole human race. That all the
sacrifices you have made for it may be abundantly
repaid, that speedy victory may attend your arms,
that victory may be followed by perfect reconcilia-
tion and the healing of all the wounds which civil
war has made, and that you may be guided by the
spirit of wisdom and of patriotism through the
work of reconstruction, and all the difficulties and
problems which remain, is the earnest prayer of
thousands and tens of thousands of English hearts,
and of none more than mine."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/centre >}}
TO THE EDITOR OF BANGKOK
RECORDER.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}I was very glad to learn from statement
in your paper relating to discovery of the
mineral oil in United States of America,
the specimen of which I have in my pos-
sesion from firm of Markswald & Co. here
some time ago. It in case of cold season
can be said that it is better than cocoanut
oil, for it was not becoming thick for pre-
vailing of cold less than 78° Farenheit. But
in other case of hot or warm sun in general
prevailing in Siam, cannot be said as bet-
ter than Cocoanut oil, as the American oil
is of strong smell and power of combusti-
bility or inflammability ; so it may be con-
sidered as dangerous. Also its flame red
and producing black smoke for making our
room unclean, in case of use in lamp with
glass chimney sometime flaming noise of
strong flame. For this instance to great
care ought to be given in its use. So the
require of the cocoanut oil is yet inevitable
for our usual lamp.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I shall be glad however to have any per-
son who may examine our land and point
out where some mineral oil would be ob-
tainiable from, either in like manner of the
American oil or of the usual Burman
mineral oil. It will be good production
of our land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I think such the consideration and en-
deavoring is suitable for us who are very
far from use of telegraph or railway which
endeavor - no doubt might be liable to be
favor to thieves, or metalic wires and
iron bars and long stones &c before use of
telegraph and railroad. Ah! O! many foreign-
ers who are endeavoring very often to let
us be advised and have great expense for
what we think will be of no use for this
country of poor and ignorant people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I would be glad to know as soon as
possible who will assist us to point the
place for some mineral oil in Siam.{{< /news/text >}}

TO THE EDITOR OF THE
Bangkok Recorder.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In an article in the "Siam Times," the
writer says, "there is only one step between
pure Buddhism and Christianity." If the
writer of that article is but a professing
Christian, which is but another name for a
down-right hypocrite, this language is all
which we might expect from him, but if
he is a lover of Jesus Christ, his own ex-
perience will give the lie to his words, and
his own heart condemns him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Buddh is a dead god, at best a lump of
inanimate matter, and his followers are
poor blind deluded mortals, wallowing in
superstition and sunk in immorality; to
them the future is shrouded in eternal
night, without one ray of hope, or they
look forward to spend it in sensual delight,
and unhallowed pleasures.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the God of the Christian is Jehovah
of Hosts, the one living and true God, the
Creator of the universe, and Jesus Christ,
the sum and centre of the Christian's soul, is ,
an ever-living, ever-loving God and Saviour,
whose service is one of love. No barthen-
some rites or superstitious worship does
He require of His followers, but the grate-
ful homage of a broken and contrite heart,
are in His sight the offering of peerless value,
"in spirit and in truth," God, our God must
be worshipped, or not at all.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nor in the Christian's hopes bounded by
time, he looks forward with bright antici-
pations to the future, into the world of
spirits, in sure and certain hope of spend-
ing a happy, yea a glorious Eternity, with
the pure and holy in his Father's house,
where Jesus dwells enthroned in glory.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How immeasurable the distance between
the two systems, any reflecting mind may
at once perceive, and any honest heart ac-
knowledge, that it is not "one step" but
Eternity.{{< /news/text >}}

MR SANDS STATEMENT
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Continued.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Finding that there was an likely-hood of
getting to Bangkok in this way, the Gov-
ernor ordered the elephants to be got in
readiness, and on the 28th Dec we took
our final departure from Champoon, Char-
les Herring (who was still sick) on one,
James Maxwell and myself on the other,
accompanied by a party of Siamese on foot.
We went as far as Bansuan on that day, and
put up at a Josh-house for the night.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Charles Herring being sick before we
started, the jotting of the elephant made
him worse, and being of opinion that he
could not bear the fatigue of traveling any
farther, I came to the conclusion to leave
him behind, but the Siamese officers not
approving of this, and the man himself
desiring to proceed, I thought it best to
take him along with me. Next day the
29th we had to wait for another elephant
the officers seeming to think that two were
not sufficient, that day Charles Herring ap-
peared much better, and on the 30th we
resumed our journey and arrived at Pa-
thieu, one of the officers took me to the
Governor's house, where I received the
same kind trearment as at my former visit.
Finding that C. Herring, was getting worse
with the consent of the Siamese officials, I
left him at Pathieu, with the Governor,
who furnished me before starting, with
some provisions for the road, in the even-
ing we rested in a bananna plantation for
the night . On January 1st 1865 we rested
on the South bank of the river, which div-
vides Pathieu from Bankapan. These two
districts (except about the Governors) ap-
pear to be one dense forest, yielding large
quantities of wood oil, many of the trees
being of immense size. At Bankapan we
stopped at the Governors, and put up in a
bamboo-shed, which appears to be intend-
ed chiefly for travelers. We were detained
here for two days, and then forwarded on
carts drawn by buffaloes. About two hours
after we started we came to a small stream
where we stopped, and unyoked the Buffa-
loes, to have a "roll in the gutter." This
was done two or three times a day, which
stopped us greatly to our progress. In the
evening we came to a cleared spot, which
had been cultivated, marks of the hand of
man were here visible, the denseness of the
forest, being relieved by patches of cleared
land at intervals. We reached Papayla on
the 6th. Here the country is clear for miles
around, running waste and uncultivated,
with but very few inhabitants. On the 7th,
continuing our journey, we came into a
mountainous district. Along the mountain
side the land is well cleared, and apparently
very fertile, if we may judge by the grass
growing upon it, which is about five feet
high. Deer, Junglefowl &c are plentiful
here. We rested for the night at Cow Leow
mountains. Our usual custom when we
could not reach a house, was to sleep under
the carts, after having set a watch to keep
the fires burning, which we were oblidged
to do, there being tigers prowling around us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our mode of cooking was somewhat
primitive, each being for the time his own
cook. Upon stopping for the night, which
always where wood and water could
be conveniently found, we proceeded to
erect our [ires. This was done in various
ways, either by taking two sticks, about six
or eight inches in diameter, and placing
them parallel to each other at convenient
distances, so that our pot would sit be-
tween, and catch each of them, the fire be-
ing between them; or we made a hole in
the ground a little smaller than the pot,
having one side open to admit the fire-
wood and air; sometimes three stones
placed at right angles answered our purpose.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We were to the natives of the district
through which we passed, what Jack terms
"a perfect curio," as soon as we arrived at
any place, the inhabitants would all gather
round staring at us, no matter how tired
we were, or how much we desired to be
free from observation, we could not keep
the natives away, whether we were cooking
or eating, they were always present, watch-
ing all our movements, making enquiry
what kind of food we eat, &c. of the Escort,
which accompanied us, and upon learning
the didèrent kinds we used, they would
sometimes bring us an old fighting cock,
(one that had been through his degrees in
the cock pit,) with him we made excellent
soup Our mode of killing and dressing Mr.
Rouster, was to them a source of merriment;
but their greatest wonder was, to find that
we lived without using beetle nut, this was
to them a matter of great surprise. This
evening we rested on the beach at the foot
of the Hoa-one Mountain. Upon starting
next morning, our road led round the moun-
tain, and after traveling all day we did not
make 4 mités in the right direction.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We arrived at Putunap the 10th and
remained till the 12th. This part of the
country is very beautiful, being well cleared
and cultivated in many places. Deer and
Jungle-fowl are plentiful, we journied and
passed through Pran, Suchoup, Cham,
and after various delays we arrived at Petch-
aburee on the 30th Jan.; but did not see
the Governor, he having gone down the
river with His Majesty the Supreme King,
who was about to return to Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Governor returned about 4 P. M.
when I went and reported myself to him.
He received me kindly and promised to
forward the party to Bangkok the follow-
ing day. The same evening a message was
sent from His Excellency the Prime Minis-
ter for me to come to his residence, the
Governor having informed him of our arri-
val. I went to his Excellency's who after
hearing my statement of the loss of the
Fah Kee, gave orders that we should be
sent on board of the Steam Yacht Volant,
then lying at the mouth of the river; and
next morning we started for Bangkok
where we arrived at 7 P.M. 21st Jan. 1865.{{< /news/text >}}
