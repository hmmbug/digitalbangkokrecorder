House Cleaning.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}"The melancholy days have come,

{{< news/indent1 >}}"The saddest of the year,"

{{< news/indent1 >}}Of cleaning paint and scrubbing floors,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And scouring far and near.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Heaped in the corners of the room,

{{< news/indent1 >}}The ancient dirt lay quiet,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And spiders wove their webs secure

{{< news/indent1 >}}From fear, and din, and riot;

{{< news/indent1 >}}But now the carpets are all up,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And from the stair-case top

{{< news/indent1 >}}The mistress calls to man and maid

{{< news/indent1 >}}To wield the broom and mop.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Where are those rooms, those quiet rooms,

{{< news/indent1 >}}The house but now presented,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Wherein we dwelt, nor dreamed of dirt,

{{< news/indent1 >}}So cosy and contented ?

{{< news/indent1 >}}Alas! they're turned all upside down,

{{< news/indent1 >}}That quiet suite of rooms,

{{< news/indent1 >}}With slops, and suds, and soap, and sand,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And tubs, and pails, and brooms;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Chairs, tables, stands, are standing round,

{{< news/indent1 >}}At sixes and at sevens,

{{< news/indent1 >}}While wife and housemaids fly about

{{< news/indent1 >}}Like meteors in the heavens.

{{< news/indent1 >}}The parlor and the chamber floor

{{< news/indent1 >}}Were cleaned a week ago,

{{< news/indent1 >}}The carpets shook, the windows washed,

{{< news/indent1 >}}As all the neighbors know

{{< news/indent1 >}}But still the SANCTUM had escaped

{{< news/indent1 >}}The table piled with books,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Pens, ink, and paper all about,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Peace in its very looks—

{{< news/indent1 >}}Till fell the women on them all,

{{< news/indent1 >}}As falls the plague on men,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And then they vanished all away

{{< news/indent1 >}}Books, papers, ink and pen.

{{< news/indent1 >}}And now, when comes the master home,

{{< news/indent1 >}}As come he must at nights,

{{< news/indent1 >}}To find all thing are "set to wrongs"

{{< news/indent1 >}}That they have "set to rights!"

{{< news/indent1 >}}When the sound of driving tasks is heard,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Though the house is far from still,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And the carpet women are on the stairs,

{{< news/indent1 >}}That harbinger of ill—

{{< news/indent1 >}}He looks for papers, books or bills

{{< news/indent1 >}}That all were there before,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And sighs to find them on the desk

{{< news/indent1 >}}Or in the drawer no more.

{{< news/indent1 >}}And then he grimly thinks of her

{{< news/indent1 >}}Who set this fuss afloat,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And wishes she were out at sea

{{< news/indent1 >}}In a very leaky boat;

{{< news/indent1 >}}He meets her at the parlor door,

{{< news/indent1 >}}With hair and cap awry,

{{< news/indent1 >}}With sleeves tucked up and broom in hand,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Defiance in her eye;

{{< news/indent1 >}}He feels quite small, and knows full well

{{< news/indent1 >}}There's nothing to be said,

{{< news/indent1 >}}So holds his tongue and drinks his tea,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And sneaks away to bed.

American Politics.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(ENGLISH VIEW.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Notwithstanding the praise we still
hear of Mr. JOHNSON'S statesmanship, it
has become increasingly evident of late
that, so far from steering the vessel of
State into the smoother waters that lay
straight before him, he has "gradually re-
versed the helm, and has been steering
for the breakers. That those who on this
side of the water most loudly sympathised
with the Confederacy as loudly praise Mr.
JOHNSON and applaud his policy ; that he
has rallied to him all the old pro-Southern
element in the South and the secession
element in the South ; and that the loyal-
ists of the South and those in the North
who made sacrifices for the Union are
nearly all against him, are facts which are
significant of his present position, and
strongly condemnatory of it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It must be clearly understood that the
issue now before the country is not that
which the friends of Mr. JOHNSON and
many of our contemporaries here assume
it to be. Of course the Philadelphia Con-
ventionists follow Mr. JOHNSON in repre-
senting the quarrel to be between himself
and the "radicals," and in identifying the
"radical" policy "with that adopted by
Congress. But the "radical" policy, a-
gainst which we have on many occasions
protested, was as different from that
adopted by Congress as "the people's"
"Charter" was different from Mr. GLAD-
STONE'S Reform Bill. Mr. THADDEUS
STEVENS would have treated the Southern
States as disorganized communities, would
have governed them as territories, and af-
ter a period would have admitted them as
new States with new constitutions into
the Federal Union. Mr. SUMNER would
have required from them the enactment of
universal negro suffrage and the renewal
of all their constitutions in a thoroughly
Republican sense. But this policy, which
we are convinced would have been infini-
tely wiser than that of Mr. JOHNSON, was
never accepted by Congress. After long,
but not too long inquiry and deliberation,
Congress agreed upon a course which was
the happy medium between the stern re-
quirements and prolonged delays of the
"radical" policy, and the yielding ease
and inconsiderate haste with which Mr.
JOHNSON would restore "the Union as
"it was." The Reconstruction Committee
sat for five months, inquired carefully and
elaborately into all the conditions which
could affect the question, and made a re-
port on which the action of Congress was
founded. It was Mr. JOHNSON'S duty to
give this committee all the information
on which his suggestions were based, and
on which he had acted, but after six weeks
of waiting all that the Committee could
get was the authenticated copies of the
constitutions of three of the States, some
newspaper clippings as to the action of a
fourth, and nothing at all about the other
seven. Yet Mr. JOHNSON was in haste for
Congress to register his decrees and re-
store the Union in his way ; and those on
this side who were raising their voices for
all kinds of information, and seeking
every pretext for delay in the mere am-
endment of our representation, were just
as loud in their denunciation of Congress
for the inquiries it was making, the full
information it was seeking, and the con-
sequent delay it was creating in the re-
construction of "a Federal Union after a
civil war had rent it." In six months Mr.
JOHNSON had made up his mind without
information—-in five months Congress got
all the information it needed, and pro-
ceeded to legislate. And just at this point,
as we showed at the time, was Mr. JOHN-
SON'S opportunity. The "Radical" policy
fell through. Congress, though asserting
the unconstitutional character of Mr.
JOHNSON'S assumption of reconstructive
power, agreed to admit all that had been
done, and to carry on the work [...] the
point to which Mr. JOHNSON had brought
it. It proposed that an amendment to the
Constitution should be made guaranteeing
the civil rights of the negroes, the public
debt and the past legislation of the North,
and redressing the inequality of represen-
tation, which makes the Southern citizens
weigh half as much again in the scale of
the Constitution as a citizen of the North.
Mr. JOHNSON'S friends supported this, the
South were known to be willing to accept
it, and the only comment made upon it,
even by those who were hostile to it, was
that it was a small result of so much la-
bour. It was proposed that on the ratifi-
cation of this amendment the Southern
representatives should be admitted, and
the Union, rendered safe by this simple
redressal of a representative inequality,
should be restored at once. That proposal
was the test of Mr. JOHNSON'S statesman-
ship and the touchstone of his sincerity.
It contained nothing which he had not
himself advocated, and nothing which
North and South would not have agreed
upon at once had Mr. JOHNSON joined with
Congress in recommending it. But it was
not needful that Congress should consult
him in making the proposal, and it passed
him over. Then it was that Mr. JOHNSON
was found wanting. Had he put aside his
personal pique, and thought only of his
country, he would have taken the Congres-
sional proposal as an olive branch, the
South would have accepted it at his hands,
the Northern States would have assembled
their Legislatures in special session to
ratify it, and by the time Congress ad-
journed, not only Tennessee, but all the
Southern States, excepting Texas, might
have been enjoying the privilege of repre-
sentation in Congress. But Mr. JOHNSON
failed his country. At the moment when
he could have done the Union essential
service he chose to serve himself. An ill-
tempered message was fulminated against
the proposal of Congress, and the word
went forth that the Union was not to be
restored if it could not be restored in Mr.
JOHNSON'S way. From that moment he
threw himself into the arms of the South.
Everywhere the old democracy, who would
have closed the war by installing Mr. DA-
VIS in Mr. LINCOLN'S place, rallied around
a new leader, and the fight of Southern
ascendancy was reopened on the field of
Northern politics. The protests against
"radicalism" are a blind—the ascription
to Congress of all the blame of delay is a
pretence; the real object of the movement
which the Philadelphia Convention has
sanctioned is the restoration of the South
without the guarantees the Congressional
proposal provides. The choice is not be-
tween what Congress has talked and what
the PRESIDENT has tried to do, but between
what Congress has done and what Mr.
JOHNSON has desired. The real issue is
whether the constitution shall be amended
so as to give equal civil rights to the
freedmen and equal political representa-
tion to the North with the South, or
whether the old Union shall be restored
with Southern preponderance and no pro-
vision for the protection of the freedmen
in their rights. Congress represents the
policy of caution, and the wise healing its
proposals would bring; Mr. JOHNSON re-
presents a policy of concession which
would give back to the South nearly all
that the sacrifices of the war have pur-
chased from it. Congress is for a lasting
union founded on equal justice to both
races and sections—-Mr. JOHNSON is for
leaving the negro to his fate, and the
North to its diminished share of Federal
power. Congress would take precautions
which are admitted to be wise and just
before entering again into Federal alliance
with those who have misused their power
Mr. JOHNSON would have no real precau-
tion taken, but would remarry the sun-
dered sections in a hurry, leaving the
North to repent at leisure. We are not,
therefore, at all surprised that our con-
temporaries who supported the South all
through the war are loud in their support
of Mr. JOHNSON now; but the same desire
for the welfare of the great people who
have sprung from the loins of England
which decided our sympathy for the
Northern cause, and made us rejoice in
the Northern victory, determines our best
hopes and wishes to the side of Congress,
which really represents all the best inter-
ests of human progress in the "reconstruc-
tion" strife which is raging now.-—DAILY

The American Ladies
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Expedition
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Mercer's party of 100 ladies, who
are on their way to Washington Territo-
ry, the uttermost north-west corner of
the United States have been heard of.
In March their steamship the Continental
had got through the Straits of Magellan,
passed into the South Pacific, and bade
good-bye to the shores of Patagonia,
when a little mistake occurred. The
correspondent of the NEW YORK TIMES,
on board, who dates from the port of
Lota, and signs himself "Rod," writes:—
"By some oversight the captain ran into
a port that was blockaded by Spanish
fleet (on paper, for not a man-of-war
was in sight), and, after leisurely drop-
ping anchor, went ashore. There he
soon learnt his mistake, and, hurrying on
board, weighed anchor and made all
speed to get out. But just as we began
to congratulate ourselves that we had es-
caped we saw a large man-of-war bearing
down upon us under full head of steam.
We tried to run by, but were soon brought
up by a peremptory shot across our bows.
A Spanish officer immediately came on
board, and spent a long time in close ex-
amination of the ship's papers. We were
decidedly a rich and novel prize, having
besides our valuable cargo over 100 good
looking marriageable young ladies on
board ; but our captor was either very
favorably impressed or happened to be
in a very generously gallant mood, for he
finally concluded to let us go. I fear
some of the fair ladies were disappointed
at the result. A voyage to Spain would
have been so romantic! But to the rest
of us it was great relief when our captor
dipped her colors and allowed us to pro-
ceed to sea. Our next stopping place
will be San Francisco."—(TIMES, MAY

Heavy guns Vs. Turret
Ironclads.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some weeks ago, a very interesting
experiment was made at Spithead near
Portsmouth on the Turret Ironclad, Her
Majesty's Ship Royal Sovereign, under
the order of the Board Admiralty. The
experiment consisted of mounting a gun
weighing twelve and a half tons on board
the Frigate BELLEBOPHON and anchoring
this vessel at a distance of two hundred
yards from the Royal Sovereign. Two
marks were painted on the turret of the
Ironclad, and one a mere chalk line along
the deck up to the base of the turret.
The gun was loaded in the first instance,
with a charge of forty three pounds of
powder, and a conoidal headed steel shot
weighing two hundred and forty six
pounds. The shot struck the mark at
the edge of the plating, next to the gun-
port, broke away a jagged piece, twelve
inches diameter from the outer, or 5½
inch armour plate, bent back and frac-
tured the inner or 7¼ inch plate, bulged
in the wooden backing and inner skin,
and passed into the turret, smashing the
wooden skeleton gun, mounted in lieu of
the turret's gun, which had been remov-
ed, into a thousand splinters, but falling
on the floor of the turret two thirds
broken up, and without doing any inter-
ior damage to the turret.'{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The second trial was from the same
gun, in which the same charge of powder
was used, but the steel shot was four
pounds heavier, distance two hundred
yards.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This shot struck the mark at the tur-
ret's weakest part, at the junction of two
plates, and drove in the broken pieces
twelve inches into the backing, about
twelve inches from the upper edge of
the plate and turret. The shot turned
upwards and remained lodged in the
wooden backing behind the amour plate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The third trial was considered a mag-
nificent shot, striking on the chalk mark.
The distance was diminished, it being in
this instance only a hundred and sixty
yards. Another conoidal headed steel
shot weighing two hundred and fifty
pounds, charge of powder forty three
pounds were employed. The target
mark was on the ship's deck, eight feet
from the side of the turret, the angle of
fire being nearly horizontal. This shot
merely scored the deck and upper collar
plating up to the face of the turret,
where it "gouged" out a piece of the
armour plating seventeen inches long by
nine inches wide and three and a half
inches in depth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After all this hard battering, the turret
rotated easily by the force of three men
at the winches. In fact the mechanical
principle of the turret remained in tact.
It is like a rifleman standing in some
secure central spot, from which he can
deliver his fire in every direction, all
round the compass.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The experiment was conducted under
Captain Key C. B., of the EXCELLENT.
There were a large number of Naval
officers on board, including all the mem-
bers of the Board of Admiralty. The
result was considered to be entirely satis-
factory, and Captain Cowper Coles, who
was present received the compliments
and general congratulations, of all pres-
ent for his persistency in advocating the
superiority of turret ships over every
other kind of Vessel of War.—RANGOON

Anthony P. Dostie.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The bloody tragedy just enacted in
New Orleans is likely to prove a leading
event in the history of reconstruction.
The hand of the Great Organizer can be
clearly seen in it; for it befalls at a mo-
ment when some extraordinary develop-
ment is requisite to lead men to discern
distinctly the nature and operation of
forces, and acknowledge the dangers to
which the national cause is exposed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the Government had neglected
its golden opportunity to determine the
status of institutions at the South in ac-
cordance with the will of the victorious
nation, and had practically adjourned the
settlement of all the underlying questions
of the war to the tribunals of local con-
flict, it was inevitable that sooner or later
blood would flow, to give divine sanction
and enlargement to the cause of the weak
against the strong. A conspicuous exam-
ple, like that which has now shocked the
nation, may serve to draw the electric
wrath from the threatening cloud of race
and class prejudice, rapidly accumulated
in Southern skies under the sunlight of
executive clemency.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the list of martyrs belonging to the
reconstruction period the name standing
at the head of this article appears in bold
relief. In his history and work, Anthony
P. Dostie represents the cause and the
conflict of the nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dr. Dostie, before the war, was a quiet,
industrious, law-abiding citizen. During
the war he expended, in charity and in
promoting the cause of the nation, the
hard earnings of his life-time. There is
no evidence that he incited insurrection
among the former slaves. They gave
heed to his words, and he counseled the
to maintain with moderation their per-
sonal rights and the rights of freedom.
Gen. Banks says of him, "I knew him
well. No country ever gave birth to a
more unselfish man, a truer patriot, or a
more devoted friend of liberty." His
fault, in the eyes of disloyal men, was
that he stood firmly by the Government
in its struggle with treason, and that he
intensely loved popular liberty. His last
breath was given to prayer that the good
work might go on. His name will be
cherished, in the better ages that are to
come, with John Brown, Gordon, of
Jamaica, and many others who dared to
love the down-trodden, and who died that
liberty might be established on the broad-
est basis of human rights.—-N. Y. INDE-

Sights in Holland.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Rotterdam correspondent of the
Boston TRAVELER, writes:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Imagine a city where every other street
is a dirty canal filled with barges, where
half the front doors open into brooks,
and the other half directly into the streets,
which are paved with brick. Imagine
everything, from street door signs to tree
trunks, perfectly white and clean, with
the exception of the water with which
everything is washed. Imagine every-
thing looking as if they had just been sent
home from a laundry, nobody dirty or
shiftless, or slovenly, and all the peasants
hobbling about in huge wooden shoes of
a hundred pounds burden (to use a nauti-
cal phrase), with soles two inches thick.
Imagine several hundred small hand carts,
laden with fruits and vegetables, pulled
by dogs who trot under the axletree while
the seller holds the affair up by the han-
dles in the rear. The horses are very few
in number, and very queer looking beasts
they are. In fact, they don't resemble
horses at all, and are so thin and miser-
able in their aspect, that I don't wonder
at the peasants preferring the dogs in
their places. All freight and heavy goods
are transported by water, and consequen-
tly there are but few wagons. Those few
are heavy and awkward, and are fasten-
ed to the horses by ropes. The streets
are lined with shade trees, and many of
the houses have beautiful gardens, with
rivulets instead of flower beds, and shaded
islands in the place of summer houses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dutch stalls, stables, barnyards, in fact
everything that I have seen in Dutchland,
is clean and fresh. In cow houses the
animals tails are tied up to a hook in the
ceiling that they may not get soiled by
contact with the floor; and when they go
out to pasture in the spring, they have a
cloth tied round them, as little boys have
bibs, to keep them nice and clean. Bugs
and spiders stand no possible chance of
existence in Holland. Every week the
whole energy of the inhabitants is devot-
ed to scrubbing and cleaning, and indeed
the whole city retains a damp appearance
all the week from the terrible drenching
it gets on Saturday.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When a person is sick, an announcement
to that effect is put up outside the door,

progresses or is checked.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In walking about this morning, I saw
several men walking very rapidly, with
enormous three-cornered black hats on,
short black coats covered with ribbons,
small clothes and black socks. They car-
ried in their hands blank edged paper,
covered with writing. The hideous hired
mourners of England are ugly enough,
but these outdo them. They were all hat
and ribbons, and I have just found out
that they are the death announcers, and
that it is their cheerful business in life to
continually call upon the friends of any
one deceased and usher in the mournful
tidings, with an invitation to the funeral.{{< /news/text >}}

Cause and Effect.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is painful to read the accounts of
the New Orleans riot in which forty Un-
ionists, from the best in the State alike
to the humblest, were foully murdered,
without feelings of indignation and shame
at the relation in which Mr. Johnson
stands to the matter. Whether, with his
knowledge, he could have anticipated
any such result we cannot say. In charity
we will hope not. But it is still true that,
as plainly as effect obeys cause, did the
outbreak follow the disgraceful despatch-
es from the White House to Mayor Mon-
roe. Mad and reckless rebels charged
the gun to which Mr. Johnson applied
the match. Nor has any subsequent ac-
tion of his indicated that he was greatly
astonished or greatly grieved at this whole-
sale murder of loyal men. The assembl-
ing of the Convention may have been un-
wise, but it had a right to assemble, as
much as Mr. Johnson's friends have to
gather at Philadelphia next week, and
the Federal arm should have protected it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Meanwhile how false are all the as-
sumptions on which the President's policy
is based; that the South has accepted the
situation in good faith and yields to it a
loyal submission. Not in the spirit of the
New Orleans massacre do men do works
meet for repentance.—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

On Public Ways.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following article copied from
VATTEL'S LAWS OF NATIONS is, if we
mistake not, appropriate and in season
for the consideration of the Siamese
government at the present time. The
government has taken a grand step in
the line of internal improvement in
giving permission to an English com-
pany to construct a Telegraph line
from Barmah to Bangkok. This line
we confidently expect will be of great
service to Siam in less than three
years, and will become increasingly so
perpetually. But it can never con-
vey any thing that is material. Siam
is in distressing need of ways that
men can travel, and ride their horses
and drive their teams upon. While
the rivers and canals are, and must
ever continue to be the chief thorough-
fares over the plains of Siam they ne-
ver can satisfy the wants of an en-
lightened and civilized nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Young Siam ever means to be ex-
pected as a civilized nation, she must
give immediate attention to the con-
struction of good roads. A great des-
titution of such facilities for traveling
is a certain sign of barbarism. While
His Majesty has made a praise-worthy
beginning in civilizing Bangkok by
causing several comfortable streets to
be made, there is yet scarcely a good
carriage road in this great metropolis
of 400,000 souls. The street Charon
Kroong comes the nearest to it: but
a carriage can run but a little way on
it before it comes to a dead halt at a
canal which has no bridge that can be
traversed by a wheel carriage. The
original plan was to have that street
merge into a road that should not end
short of Paknam, and that all the
bridges should be suitable for wheel
carriages. Why has the government
become slack and stopped the work
ere one third of the road has been
completed? This great city needs
many more good streets like two or
three we have noticed within the walls,
streets leading out into the country
in many directions, inviting the citi-
zens to seek horses and carriages, and
find wholesome recreation on land in
exchange oftentimes for the monoto-
nous and indolent mode of riding in
boats. Boat-riding would be much
more pleasant than it is, if the tide
would always favor both going and
coming, but such favors are few and
far between. We beg to repeat it,
though it be the third or fourth time,
that Western Bangkok is to this day
in the depths of barbarism in regard
to streets. There is really a distress-
ing need of a street of the same size
and extent of Charon Kroong. We
hope government will forthwith de-
termine upon having one made, and
show that it hath power to accom-
plish it. We trust the road to T'achcon
will be made however much the nobles
and lords along its line may oppose it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But it strikes us that no new road
is so much needed at the present time
as one from Rahaang to Cheangmai,
where now there are only footpaths
for Elephants, who have to travel them
ten days to reach the Laos capital. The
way by the river in ascending from that
place requires full a month of hard
polling to make the city, and is attend-
ed with great difficulties and dangers
in passing over the falls in the moun-
tain gorges. We have learned from
well informed Laos princes, who
have recently left this city on their
journey homeward, that there are
no serious obstacles in the way of
making even a rail road from Ra-
haang to Cheangmai. If so, then cer-
tainly a carriage road could be made
with comparatively little expense. We
regard it of the first importance to the
welfare of both the Siamese and
Cheangmai governments that greater
facilities of intercourse be opened
between the two countries than now
exist. They need by every means to
be brought nearer to each other. And
a good road where we have named
would reduce the separation of six
weeks to about four. We would pray
the government to take this matter
into serious consideration, for that
great, rich, and beautiful Laos coun-
try is becoming too important in the
estimation of the world to remain any
longer so inaccessible to her Suza-
rain. Siamese as well as Europeans in-
terested in the Teak trade of the vast
Laosian forests going and coming on that
business, call loudly for a good road from
Rahaang to Cheangmai.{{< /news/text >}}

Of the care of the public ways
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
OF COMMUNICATION,
AND THE RIGHT OF TOLL.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The utility of highways, bridges,
canals, and, in a word, of all safe and
commodious ways of communication,
cannot be doubted. They facilitate
the trade between one place and ano-
ther, and render the conveyance of
merchandize less expensive, as well as
more certain and easy. The merchants
are enabled to sell at a better price,
and to obtain the preference; an at-
traction is held out to foreigners,
whose merchandizes are carried
through the country, and diffuse
wealth in all the places through which
they pass. France and Holland feel
the happy consequences of this from
daily experience.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the principal things that
ought to employ the attention of the
government with respect to the wel-
fare of the public in general, and of
trade in particular, must then relate
to the highways, canals, &c. in which
nothing ought to be neglected to make
them safe and commodious. France
is one of those states where this duty
to the public is discharged with the
greatest attention and magnificence.
Numerous paroles everywhere watch
over the safety of travelers; magnifi-
cent roads, bridges, and canals, facili-
tate the communication between one
province and another;—Lewis XIV.
joined the two seas by a work worthy
of the Romans.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The whole nation ought, doubtless,
to contribute to such useful undertak-
ings. When therefore the laying out
and repairing of highways, bridges,
and canals, would be too great a bur-
then on the ordinary revenues of the
state, the government may oblige the
people to labor at them, or to contri-
bute to the expence. The peasants,
in some of the provinces of France,
have been heard to murmur at the la-
bors imposed upon them for the con-
struction of roads; but experience had
no sooner made them sensible of their
true interest, than they blessed the
authors of the undertaking.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The construction and preservation
of all these works, being attended by
great expense, the nation may very
justly oblige all those to contribute to
them, who receive advantage from
their use. This is the legitimate ori-
gin of the right of toll. It is just that
a traveler, and especially a merchant,
who receives advantage from a bridge,
a canal, or a road, in his own passage,
and in the more commodious convey-
ance of his merchandize, should help
to defray the expenses of these useful
establishments, by a moderate contri-
bution, and if the state thinks proper
to exempt the citizen from paying it,
she is under no obligation to gratify
strangers in this particular.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But a law so just in its origin fre-
quently degenerates into great abuses.
There are countries where no care is
taken of the highways, and where ne-
vertheless considerable tolls are exac-
ted. A lord of a manor, who happens
to possess a strip of land terminating
on a river, there established a toll,
though he is not at a farthing's ex-
pense at keeping up the navigation of
the river, and rendering it convenient.
This is a manifest extortion, and an
infringement of the natural rights of
mankind. For the division of lands,
and their becoming private property,
can never deprive any man of the right
of passage, when not the least injury
is done to the person through whose
territory he passes. Every man in-
herits this right from nature, and can-
not justly be forced to purchase it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the arbitrary or customary
law of nations at present tolerates this
abuse, where it is not carried to such
an excess as to destroy commerce.
People do not, however, submit with-
out difficulty, except in the case of
those tolls which are established by
ancient usage; and the imposition of
new ones is often the source of dispu-
tes. The swiss formerly made war on
the Dukes of Milan, on account of
some oppressions of this nature. This
right of toll is also further abused,
when the passenger is obliged to con-
tribute too much, and what bears no
proportion to the expenses of preserv-
ing these public passages.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At present, to avoid all difficulty
and oppression, nations settle these
points by treaties.{{< /news/text >}}

The Bangkok Lottery.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The great Lottery establishment of
Bangkok is located within the city
walls a little distance from Tapankán.{{< /news/text >}}
</div>
{{< news/br >}}
<!-- Article: 1866-11-22_2_4 text -->
<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}It has been in operation from about
the middle of the last reign, having
been introduced from China. The
game consists in staking any amount
of money you please to any one of
thirty-four letters of the Siamese al-
phabet which you fancy will be a lucky
one. These thirty-four letters are
written on as many small blocks of
wood—one on each. On the opposite
side of each block is written a Chinese
character which answers to its Siamese
letter. One of these blocks is selected
by the master of the game sometime
before break of day, and hung up in
a bag in his office daily. Another is
selected and hung up in the same way
sometime before the close of each day.
The former is taken out of its conceal-
ment at an appointed hour every
morning and the latter every evening.
Whoever has staked money for the
morning game must have his certifi-
cate of the same presented at the time
of the drawing out of the morning let-
ter, and whoever has staked for the
evening game must be ready in the same
way for it. If, for example, one has
staked a Tical to a certain letter, and
that letter be the one taken from the bag
and the one he has had written in his
sealed certificate of the act, he draws
thirty-fold of the amount he staked,
and pays one of it to the lottery agent
who received the stake and wrote
the certificate. It is the business
of the agent to present to the mas-
ter the money staked, and a copy
of the certificate which he gave the
person who staked the money. The
agent gets for his pay 7½ cents for
every 5 ticals of stakes which he
hands over to the master. The least
sum allowed to be staked at a time
is five p, equal to one-tenth of a 7½
cents. The more common stake, is one
tical. Monied men often stake 20, 30, 40,
50 ticals or more. Should the letter
attached to a stake of 50 ticals corres-
pond with the letter drawn out of the
bag at the lottery it will draw thirty-
fold that amount, and the agent would
be entitled to 500 ticals of the same.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is estimated that there are more
than a thousand of these lottery agents
located in the city and its suburbs.
They are found seated at the corners
of nearly all the streets and lanes, and
all along the chief thoroughfares, do-
ing their utmost to induce men, wo-
men, and children to stake their mo-
ney for a prize. Chinese agents write
the certificates with the Chinese cha-
racter and the Siamese with Siamese
letters.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This is a perpetual operation, hav-
ing no Sabbath of rest and scarcely
any time for sleep. Every lottery
agent and enticer is of course interes-
ted in getting as great an amount of
stakes as possible. Because occasion-
ally one of them gets forty or fifty Tio-
als a day all others are stimulated
with the hope that they may have
the same good luck over and above
their regular pay for every 5 ticals
paid into the lottery. Hence there is
never any want of volunteer agents;
and all who volunteer are of course
accepted as they are never paid any
thing for their labor that does not go
directly to swell the gains of the lot-
tery. Failures in drawing seldom
stop the adventurer from trying it
again and again until he has not ano-
ther of that he can command for the
game. The agents are kept under
much the same exhausting excitement
until poverty stares them in the face
and compels them to seek some
other business. Thus are vast multi-
tudes of this city and to a great ex-
tent in the city, for a distance of
ten or fifteen miles kept under conti-
nual and corroding excitement, which in
19 cases out of twenty, at the least, is
utterly fruit-less tending perpetually to
poverty, slavery, and madness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The daily receipts at the lottery
office are said to be from 50 to 60
changes—-Ticals 4,000 and Ticals 4,800.
If we take the smaller sum as the aver-
age it would be equal to Ticals 1,460,000
annually. Of this sum the government
must have one-tenth that is Ticals 146,-
000. This revenue although great has
not the weight of a feather in the
scale of good, when compared with the
evils which the collecting of it from the
people produces. It is as it were blood
drawn from the vitals of the body po-
litic, and weakness, and disease, and
ulceration, and mortification given in
exchange for it.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Royal Polygamy.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In reply to an article we had in our
last issue save one, on the expediency
of His Majesty the king's breaking
up his great harem, and abolishing po-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}lygamy in his own family, he has sent
us a verbal message to the purport,
that when we will stop the princes and
noblemen from offering their daughters
to him as concubines, then he will stop
receiving any more women in this ca-
pacity. In other words he would have
us and the public understand that he
does not feel that he should bear the
chief responsibility in this matter, but
that it belongs to the nobles and lords who
urge their daughters upon him, by the
force of custom handed down scores
of generations which he feels himself
impotent to stem. Thus does the king
prove himself to be a true son of Adam
who cast the blame of eating the for-
bidden fruit upon mother Eve, and she
in her turn upon the devil. We have
no doubt that His Satanic Majesty is
the prime mover in this violation of
the 7th commandment which is the di-
vine and admiral arrangement for the
propogation of the human species and
for the consequent fruitfulness and hap-
piness of man in this life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But while the king can prove that
his nobles and lords have importuned
him to recieve their prettiest daugh-
ters into the relation of concubines
that each might such have the honor
of being a father-in-law to the king
and the hope of having grandchildren
by them, who shall be known and hon-
ored as the sons and daughters of His
Majesty, can it be possible that he so-
riously flatters himself that he has
therefore in any sense been justified
in yielding to their importunities?
Had he not power to decline such off-
ers! If we have been correctly inform-
ed he has rejected many such 'simply
because he did not wish his family to
become half as large as that of his
half brother's the late king. If he
had power to limit the expansion of
his family to a number a little short
of an hundred concubines, and thus to
refuse three offers of beautiful women
to his brother's one, could he not have
refused ninety nine others?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our mother Eve made out a strong
plea in justification of her act of diso-
bedience. The devil had promised her
very great exaltation and power by it,
even divine knowledge of good and e-
vil. Could His Majesty have been
more powerfully tempted? He would
give us to think that had he refused to
accept of the daughters that were off-
ered him, he would have consequently
incurred the displeasure of his nobility.
and rendered himself liable of a sum-
mary expulsion from the throne. If
this were really his state of mind, he
must have felt himself miserably weak
although seated on the throne of the
Prabats. Such dependence on the
pleasure of his subjects can scarcely
find a parallel among all the nations of
this world. Queen Elizabeth of Eng-
land felt that she had power, even in
the childhood of that nation, to reject
all proposals made to her that she should
have a royal Consort. But the king of
Siam has felt himself too weak to say
no to any one of the scores of pretty
girls that have been offered him. The
truth is His Majesty would honor him-
self more by frankly acknowledging
that he has from the beginning "loved
many women" and that this is the sole
reason why he has so many in his ha-
rem, than he does by pleading his im-
potency in resisting the abominable
custom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But since the king has thus plunged
himself into this accursed polygamy,
which God once "winked at" it is true
but "now commands men every where to
repent" of it, how shall he get out
of it.? As it is a great sin committed
in probation there must be some way
by which he can repent and forsake
it. The question how, is a great one
as it has to deal with a polygamy of
monstrous dimensions and gigantic
power. We feel it to be our duty to
give our views on the question, and
will therefore venture to do so.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first step is for His Majesty to
determine that he will now stop add-
ing any more to the great number he
has. It is rumoured that the king has
his eye upon another princess of the
highest rank with a view of constitu-
ting her a Queen Consort. Now con-
sidering that he is full three score and
three years of age, that he has already
scores of concubines and about four
score sons and daughters, with several
Chowfahs among them, and hence eli-
gible to the highest posts of honor in
the kingdom, this rumour seems to be
too monstrous to be credited. But the
truth is there is scarcely anything too
monstrous for the royal polygamy of
Siam to bring forth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the second place, it strikes us
that if we were in such a predicament
as His Majesty, and possessed the
light we now do, we would say to all
our concubines, that we now see their
relation to us involves both them, and
us in deep guilt in the sight of our ma-
ker and judge—-that he commands us
to repent of it aud forsake it-—that
hence we dare not have it continued
any longer—that we will guarantee
them a comfortable support through
life,—-and that they must now cease to
be any part of our family. But in
regard to the children by them, we
shall continue to account them as
our own, and protect and love and
honor them as much as if their moth-
ers had not been divorced from us.
This would indeed be a heart rending
work, but not more so than the holy
and righteous law of the most High
God requires in such a case. It
would indeed be like plucking out
the eye, which the Son of God taught
must be done with darling sins. It
would be no more severe than the
prophet Ezra required of the one
hundred and eight rulers, nobles, and
priests and others of Israel who “had
taken strange wives and had children
by them.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Will His Majesty still think that
this is an unreasonable and im-
possible requirement? It was not so,
it seems, with the viceroy of Egypt.
The king of Siam did not account it
unreasonable in Buddhism to require
him to divorce his first and only wife
that he might enter the priesthood.
He would not consider it unreasona-
ble in Buddhism to require him to
divorce every concubine he has, and
even his queen if he had one, for the
sake of obtaining the state of eternal
unconsciousness called Nippán. How
much more reasonable then is it in
Christianity to require him to abolish
polygamy for the sake of the ever-
lasting favor of God in the enjoy-
ment of Eternal life?{{< /news/text >}}

this city began on the 9th inst. and were
closed on the 19th. In the course of
these 11 days he worshipped the im-

and other gifts to the priests in about
forty wats. The other 70 or 80
temples within the city will all, as we
suppose, have similar gifts carried to
them by others, if that has not already
been done, as this is the season for
such honor to be conferred upon them.
Those of them that have been dedi-

at any previous time this year, al-
though the rains have ceased for near-
ly a month, and we are enjoying the
most delightful weather. In this we
have a little of the experience of the
inhabitants of lower Egypt. The
wonder has ever been, whence comes
the water in the times of the overflow-
ings of the Nile, since no rain falls
there, and the river has no tributaries
for more than a thousand miles. The
solution of the rising of our river
overflowing her banks now, is that the
great abundance of rain water hurrying at
the North in its downward flow has but
just now reached us, and that compara-
tively but little of it has evaporated
since it fell.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}We are credibly informed, that the
four immense spars of timber designed
for the main pillars of the royal pro-
mane or canopy for the obsequies of
His Majesty the late 2nd King of
Siam, who deceased more than 10
months since, have been lost in the
Gulf of Siam. The circumstances of
the accident as related to us are,—
that one of His Majesty's steamers
had them in tow bringing them from
the Siamese coast on the gulf, and
getting out of coal and wood on
certain soundings a few miles from
the Bar, managed to anchor the raft
and came into Paknum for fuel. On
going back for the spars they were
not to be found,—the strong north-
wind having sent them adrift. This
occurred some four weeks ago, and
steamers and sail-boats, not a few,
have been sent out by the Siamese
government in search of them: but all
in vain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Captain Ross on his way up the
Gulf about three weeks since, reports
that he saw what he now thinks must
have been those spars, about 20 miles
South of the anchorage. One of his
officers seeing them ahead at the dis-
tance of several miles took them to
be land and cried out Land ho!
The captain was quite startled to
think that he was so much out of his
reckoning, as to meet land so unex-
pectedly. The lead was cast and show-
ed 20 fathoms of water. The ship
was allowed cautiously to approach
nearer, and when within a half a
mile sheered off to avoid collision.
It was then concluded that the land
had turned into a great mass of flood
wood, and no more was thought of it
until arrival in port.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There appears to be little probabil-
ity that the spars will be found, and
consequently the obsequies of the
late 2nd King will have to be post-

{{< news/text >}}We learn that the Siamese steamer
yatch Arrow burst her boiler several
days since somewhere near the mouth
of Meklong river; but strange to re-
late, no person was seriously injured
by the accident. It is said that one
man was thrown overboord, but being a
swimmer, as nearly all the Siamese are,
he got aboard again shortly without in-
jury. Several persons were slightly
scalded and otherwise wounded. It
appears that the steam guage of the
boiler had got out of repair and hence
deceived the engineer so that he fired
up beyond the endurance of the boil-
er.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is quite remarkable that this is
the first accident of the kind that the
Siamese have had since the introduc-
tion of steam power nine years ago.
They have had several narrow escapes
by which their engineers have had a
little warning. It is to be hoped that
this occurrence will put them more on
their guard, not in the reduction of
their speed by any means, for that is
always moderate enough, but in re-
guard to keeping their engines in good
repair.{{< /news/text >}}

The last Buddh. Gaudama.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Various writers who have taken up the
subject of the last Buddh, have written
the name as Gautemah, which is incor-
rect, because it does not convey the idea
which the correct vernacular orthography
does. The closing syllables are Da-ma
which signify sacred or Holy. The learn-
ed Bishop Bigandet has accepted the or-
thography followed by all persons, who
have any knowledge of the Burmese lang-
uage, and in this respect, is in conformity
with all the ancient writers among the
Burmese.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gaudama was a great historical charac-
ter. The Hindoos consider this personage
to have been one of the incarnations of
Vishnu, but there appears to be a discrep-
ancy of about five hundred years in the
Hindoo and Buddhist accounts of the ap-
pearance of this heathen god. The Gauda-
ma of Buddhist writers appeared in the
world about five hundred years anterior
to the birth of Christ.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As mentioned in a former notice of the
excellent work, entitled, "The Life and
Legend of Gaudama," the Right Reverend
Bishop Bigandet translates into English,
from a work which is itself a translation.
Most of the ancient books relating to the
last Buddh were written in Pali, which
holds precisely the same relation to the
Buddhist scriptures, as Hebrew does to the
Bible of Christians. It is doubtful wheth-
er Pali was ever anything more, than a
learned or dead language among the Bur-
mese. But from Pali the Life and Legend
of Gaudama was translated into the ver-
nacular of this country. The Burmese trans-
lator who was a believer in this form of
faith, thus commences his work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I adore Buddha, who has gloriously
emerged from the bottomless whirlpool of
endless existences, who has extinguished
the burning fire of anger and other pas-
sions; who opened and illuminated the
fathomless abyss of dark ignorance, and
who is the greatest and most excellent of
all beings."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I adore the law which the most excellent
Buddha has published, which is infinitely
high and incomparably profound and ex-
ceedingly acceptable and most earnestly
wished for by Nats and men, capable to
wipe off the stains of concupiscence and
is immutable."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I adore the assembly of the perfect, of
the pure and illustrious Arihas in their
eight sublime states, who have overcome
all the passions that torment other mortals,
by eradicating the very root of concupis-
cence, and who are famous above all other
beings."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I undertake to translate from the Pali
text, the history of our most excellent
Patara from the period he left Tavatsa the
fourth abode of Nats to the time he entered
into the state of Nêrûban."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The vernacular translator thus makes a
brief confession of his faith, with a view of
showing his qualification for the task he
undertakes. "It is his intention not to
give "the worthy Bishop, remarks in a
foot note in reference to the translator,
"the history of Buddh during the count-less
existences that have preceded the last one,
when he obtained the supreme intelli-
gence." The narrative was to commence
from the time Gaudama was at Tavatsa
or the joyful abode of the Nats, and to be
continued up to the period of his attain-
ing Neibban, or annihilation."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The father of Gaudama was King Thoke-
dan-thana, and his mother was Manlau
Mayah. The spelling in English of Bur-
mese names rests wholly on personal taste.
There is no fixed standard to guide. The
sound is given and then letters are used to
bring it as near as possible to the original.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The worthy Bishop thus describes the
Birth of Buddha in a forest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The time of her approaching confine-
ment being close at hand the princess soli-
cited from her husband King Taoke-dau-
thana leave to go to the country of Dewah
amongst her friends and relatives. As soon
as her request was made known, the King
ordered that the whole extent of the road
between Kapilawot and Dewah should be
perfectly level and lined on both sides with
plantain trees, and adorned with the finest
ornaments. Jars full of the purest water
were to be deposited all along the road at
short intervals. A chair of gold was made
ready for conveying the Queen. A thousand
noblemen, attended by an innumerable
retinue were directed to accompany her
during the journey. Between the two
countries an immense forest of lofty
Engyin trees extends at a great distance.
As soon as the cortège reached it, the five
water lilies shot forth spontaneously from
the stem and main branches of each. In-
numerable birds of all kinds by their
melodious tunes filled the air with the most
ravishing music. Trees similar in beauty
to those growing in the seats of the Nats,
apparently sensible of the incarnated
Buddha, seemed to share in the universal
joy."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This is truly a graphic description of the
commencement of the royal journey and
shows the descriptive powers possessed by
the excellent Bishop. The meagre work
of rendering word for-word would make
it a most dry and uninviting production.
Continuing the narrative, the Bishop
proceeds.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"On beholding this wonderful appear-
ance of all the lofty trees of the forest, the
queen felt a desire to approach nearer and
enjoy the marvellous sight, offered to her
astonished regards. Her noble attendants
led her forth with a short distance into the
forest. Main seated on her couch, along
with her sister Patsapaty desired her at-
tendants to have it moved closer to an
Engyin tree [Shorea robusta] which she
pointed out. Her wishes were immediate-
ly complied with. She then rose gently
on her couch, her left hand round the neck
of her sister, supported her in a standing
position with the right hand she tried to
reach and break a small branch which she
wanted to carry away. On that very in-
stant as the slender rattan heated by fire
bursts down its tender head, all the bran-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ches lowered their extremities offering
themselves as it were to the hand of the
Queen, who unhesitatingly seized and
broke the extremity of one of the young
boughs. By virtue of a certain power in-
herent in her dignity on a sudden all the
winds blew gently through the forest.
The attendants having desired all the peo-
ple to withdraw to a distance, disposed
curtains all round the place, on which the
queen was standing. Whilst she was in
that position, admiring the slender bough
she held in her hands the moment of her
confinement happened and she was deliver-
ed of a son.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Four chief Brahmas received the new
born infant on a golden net work and
placed him in the presence of the happy
mother, saying “Give yourself up O
Queen to joy and rejoicing. Here is the
precious and wonderful fruit of your
womb.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“From the hands of the four chief Brah-
mas four chief of Nats received the bless-
ed child, whom they handed over to men,
who placed him on a beautiful white cloth.
But to the astonishment of all he freed
himself from the hand of those attending
upon him, and stood in a firm and erect
position on the ground. Casting then a
glance towards the east, more than one
thousand worlds appeared like a perfectly
levelled plain. All the Nats inhabiting
those worlds made offerings of flowers and
perfumes, exclaiming with exultation:—
“An exalted personage has made his ap-
pearance, who can ever be compared to
him? Who has equalled him? He is in-
deed the most excellent of all beings.
Paraloung looked again towards the three
other directions. Lifting up his eyes
above and then lowering them down, he
saw there was no being equal to him.
Conscious of his superiority, he jumped
over a distance of seven lengths of a foot
in a northern direction exclaiming:—“Tals
is my last birth there shall be no other
state of existence. I am the greatest of all
beings.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He then began to walk steadily in the
same direction. A chief of Brahmas held
over his head the white umbrella. A Nat
carried the golden fan. Other nats held
in their hands the golden sword, the golden
slippers, the cope set with the rarest pre-
cious stones and other royal insignia.”
Gaudama as thus described was not only
able to use his limbs but his mental facul-
ties from the first moments of his exis-
tence. But of course no belief would be
placed in him without some such super-
natural gifts being ascribed to him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What is singular about this personage
is, that during his life time, there was
nothing written down concerning his his-
tory his teachings or his laws. They ap-
pear to have been handed down by tradi-
tion only from one generation to another,
and to have been written out by his fol-
lowers some two or three hundred years
after his death. Though the present system
of Buddhism is attributed to this particular
person called Gaudama, yet it is very
evident that he had little or nothing to do
with it. The writers of the system were
perfectly safe in ascribing it to a teacher,
who had lived over two hundred years be-
fore them. No test could then be deman-
ded of its supernatural character. These
might have been asked, when the teacher
lived, who is said to be its author, but as
the books were written at a long period
afterwards, the real inventors of it might
well escape the proof required, by attribut-
ing the good or evil of it, to one who had
long since passed away.—RANGOON TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

French Neatness.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is quite certain that unless you go
into the very haunts of vice, where mis-
ery is born and bred, you will never see
any of Paris. The boot black, from the
peculiar nature of his occupation, ap-
pears to be on less familiar terms with
soap and water than any other of the
human family, and in England and Amer-
ica holds his rags and dirt as preroga-
tives. But the Paris boot-black, is al-
ways a man; he is always clad in uni-
form, generally of a blue plush, and any
lady might shake hands with him with-
out gloves and without fear. His box
is very large, and he carries a camp stool,
which supersedes the necessity of balan-
cing on one leg during the process of
polishing. When asked what is due
them, they invariably reply 'what you
please.' The fee is about five cents, but
I tried one once with a one cent piece,
to see how much sincerity there was in
his 'what you please.' Off came his
hat,—down went his bow,—and you
might have supposed from his 'merci,
monsieur,' that I had given him a franc.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The workmen also have a uniform, or
rather they all dress alike, with white
pants and blue blouses. Instead of our
poor tatardemallions, in flattering rags
of every hue, vests wrong side out,
grandfather's coats on small boys, sho[?]ing
and over-grown boots, one sees in
the French laborers a respectable and
really picturesque company. I think
there must be some law against rags, for
the very beggars wear the same white
pants, and blue frocks, cheap and coarse,
but decent looking until utterly worn
out. The withered women who sell
jimeracks at street corners, and even the
fat fishmongers in the greasy stalls, look
fresh and blooming in their starched
white caps and clean calicoes. The very
herrings seem graceful under their touch,
though they had arms like Amazons.
It was wonderful to see into what a
garden the vegetable market could be
transformed, merely by the arrangement
of carrots and cabbages. Workmen,
fishmongers, beggars and all has flowers.
You are constantly saying, 'this is theat-
rical,' 'this is like ideal stage life where
everybody is romantic.' 'Is it possible
that these are real men and women, or is
it all a dream that bewilders me?' Then
you walk through the garden of the
Tuilleries again where hundreds of wom-
en have brought their knitting and their
families to pass the day under the shade
of the trees. There the rich and poor
children play together, but there is no
squabbling, nor rolling in the dirt, no
screams of delight or of fear. You can-
not believe your ears when you hear one
small tot say to another, 'C'est pas gen-
til,' and observe the instantaneous effect
produced by those five words.—CORRES-

How to Keep out the Moths.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A good old lady gave the best receipt to
her niece, whom she found one day examin-
ing her wardrobe. It had been copied
from an old-fashioned book, and was this:
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves break through and
steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves do not
break through nor steal." The application
of this ancient receipt is very simple:
Look over the wardrobe, and bring out all
that can be spared,—-blankets and shawls,
coats and cloaks,—-and send them to the
poor in time; let the widow of the destitute
have them before the moths have begun
their inroads. "He that hath two coats
let him impart to him that hath none."
This will do more to keep out moths than
all the cedar closets, or snuff and camphor,
in the world; and will be likely, if done in
a Christian, generous spirit, to secure the
blessing of Him that maketh rich, and
doubly sweeten what is left.—-N. Y. Obs.{{< /news/text >}}

Devastation.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}“The Secretary of the New York
Chamber of Commerce,” says the Hong-
kong Daily Press, “has compiled a
complete table of all the vessels destroy-
ed by privateers during the American
Rebellion, comprising also the value of
cargo and vessel, date of capture and
destruction, and all items of interest
connected therewith. The captured prop-
erty is found to be of the value of $25,
500,000, of which $20,000,000, was ut-
terly destroyed. The rest were chiefly
bonded. The number of piratical ves-
sels engaged in this devastation was, viz;
steamers 14; barks 5; brigs 1; schooners
5; total 25.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The number and classes of vessels

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Sensation in France.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have only to read the French press
to ascertain how deep and wide spread a
sensation has been produced in the minds
of the French people, or perhaps in the
minds of those who write for them, by
the Prussian victories. M. Foresade re-
minds us of our alarmists at home.
France is able to bring 700,000 men in-
to the field, on a few days notice, yet it
is discovered that the country is defence-
less, virtually without an army. The
sudden vault of Prussia to the rank of a
first rate military power is viewed with
jealousy and almost with apprehension.
The wilder spirits discourse of immedi-
ate war, and already snift the coming
carnage. We rejoice to believe that the
Emperor does not share in these pas-
sionate illusions. He has given no rea-
son for supposing that he is envious of
the success of Prussia, or that he sees in
it any danger for France. He knows
that France is too strong to have the re-
motest cause of apprehension. Twice
as populous as Prussia, more than equal
in numbers to the whole of Germany,
with one of the most numerous and best
disciplined armies in the world, what
can France have to fear? Moreover the
movement in Germany is in harmony
with the Emperor's most cherished poli-
cy. He sees that there can be no lasting
peace in Europe save upon the basis of
satisfied nationalities. He aims at sup-
pressing revolutions abroad by extingui-
shing the materials that breed them.
This is one explanation of the sagacious
and statesman-like policy which he has
pursued in dealing with Italy. His poli-
cy has been completely triumphant there:
one volcano has become extinct; why
should he object to another undergoing
the same fate? The prospects of his
dynasty are linked with the prosperity
of France and the repose of Europe; we
believe he is at heart desirous of promoting
both these interests, and in that case he
may well regard with acquiescence, if not
with complacency, the immense stride
which has been taken under the auspices
of Prussia towards the pacification of
Germany.—SINGAPORE DAILY NEWS.{{< /news/text >}}

How Ministers are Bored.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A gentleman living in a house that
had previously been occupied by a popu-
lar clergyman, at Rochester, N. Y., was
so constantly bored by all sorts of trave-
ling agents and other bores, that he
posted a card on his door, addressed "to
all whom it may concern," running
thus:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Dr._____ does not live here. He has
moved away, and will not occupy this
house again till May 15, 1867. In con-
sequence of this, the present incumbent
has decided to suspend the free list. No
books, maps, pictures, stationery or re-
cipes of any kind wanted. No history
of the rebellion, whether written by
Greeley or Jeff. Davis. Have no desire
to put my name in any subscription book
in order that it may be used for influence.
Have no old clothes except those I am
now wearing, and the customs of modern
society are unfortunately such that I can-
not dispense with them. Have no cold
pieces, for we cannot get money enough
to purchase at one time more than we
can eat at one meal, consequently pro-
prietors of boarding houses will have to
look elsewhere for supplies. This house
will not be kept as a hotel and warm
meals at all hours will not be furnished.
Have not a spear of hay in the barn, nor
a single oat, and have not taken care of
horses since I drove on the canal, which
means that we have no room for horses
or donkeys either. Have no vacant rooms
or beds to spare for agents, elders, beg-
gars, sponges, leeches, professional bores,
seedy students. soldiers. sailors, negroes,
freemen's, aid society agents, rebels or
abolitionists, even though ministers in
neighboring towns and cities have told
them to be sure and call here. No
money to spare for any of the above in-
dividuals or enterprises which they re-
present, even though it be for the lauda-
ble object of furnishing unborn African
children with red flannel night caps and
fine-tooth combs. In a word, the minis-
ter don't live here now, and "old things
have passed away, and all are become
new."—-Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

Another Atlantic Cable.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Wonders never cease. The successful
laying of the Atlantic Cable, which is
now keeping us in hourly communication
with all parts of the Old World, has
been succeeded by what strikes us with
even more of admiration, the recovery of
the cable which was lost in mid-ocean a
year ago, and the immediate transmission
of the intelligence of its recovery to the
American shore by the way of Ireland,
through both the old and the new cables.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This is an achievement of science and
skill which reflects the highest credit
upon those who have accomplished the
work. It is certainly a marvel, even in
this age of marvels, that simply by re-
taining the bearings, in latitude and
longitude, of the spot where the cable
was lost, a vessel should be able to re-
turn to it, pick it up from the bottom
of the sea at the depth of two miles, and
immediately resume communication with
the shore.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One very important result of this a-
chievement is the demonstration of the
fact that the cable is uninjured by lying
in the depths of the ocean for a year. If
this was the case with the old one much
more may we depend on the permanence
of the cable, which has been prepared
with far greater care and precaution a-
gainst injury.{{< /news/text >}}

Generals at Work.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of our leaders is now in charge of
a machine for patent pumping; another
is building a railway through the oil
country. One of the first soldiers of the
Army of the Potomac is in the pistol
business; another keeps a retail grocery
store; while one of Sherman's most
trusted lieutenants is a claim-agent. One
major-general prints a weekly journal in
Baltimore. Some of our officers have
drifted into Congress; others are on their
way to distant courts, to represent the
honor of a nation they did so much to
sustain. These starred and belted gent-
lemen go down from the command of co-
horts, to become agents, and partners,
and dealers, perhaps, with the orderly
who stood before their tents, or the pri-
vate who held their stirrup. So with the
generals of the rebellion. The greatest
of them all is now a teacher of mathema-
tics in a university. Sherman's great
antagonists are in the express and rail-
road business. The once dreaded Beaure-
gard will sell you a ticket from New Or-
leans to Jackson; and if you want to
send a couple of hams to a friend in
Richmond, Joe Johnson, once comman-
der of great armies, will carry them for
you.—-TRIBUNE.{{< /news/text >}}

The Soul Made Visible.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Every one knows that in every human
face there is an impalpable, immaterial
something, which we call “expression,”
which seems to be, as it were, “the soul
made visible.” Where minds live in the
region of pure thoughts and happy emo-
tions, the felicities and sanctities of the
inner temple shine out through the mor-
tal tenement, and play over it like lam-
bent flame. On the other hand, no man
can lead a gormandizing, sordid, or licen-
tious life and still wear a countenance
hallowed and sanctified jwith a halo of
peace and joy. Around such great manu-
facturing towns as Birmingham in Eng-
land, or Pittsburgh in this country, where
bituminous coal is used, you will find the
roses in the flowerbeds and the strawber-
ries defiled by a foul deposite from a
thousand chimneys. Thus do obscene,
profane and irreverent men scatter their
grime and stench upon the innocence
and beauty around them, but most deep-
ly and fully upon themselves.—-HORACE
