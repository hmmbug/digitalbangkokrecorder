Bangkok September 1st.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The principle local event which has trans-
pired since our last issue is the government
proclamation, which will be found in an-
other column, removing the prohibition
which has been in force for this last seven
months, forbidding the exportation of
rice. Those whose business it is to export
will doubtless breathe a little more freely,
even if the removal of the prohibition can
at present be of very little benefit to them.
It is natural for those whose business is
trade to want all restrictions upon it re-
moved should there be little or no trade at
the time. So long however as rice is so scarce
and dear, and prices abroad so low it matters
but little to exporters whether the pro-
hibition be removed or not. It is said that
there was considerable opposition among
government officials, and even from the
throne itself, to the removal of the pro-
hibition, the principle reason given being
a fear of scarcity and famine in the country.
It is believed by some that there is still
quite an amount of paddy in the country,
and suppose there is, it is in such hands
that it cannot be got at until there is a fair
prospect of a crop. Much as the Siamese
love money, they have still a natural dread
of famine, and they will forego the pleasure
of the former, in order to prevent the lat-
ter. Their influence is such that they can
control the avenues to the city and prevent
large quantities of paddy reaching here
without any apparent violation of the treaty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So far as can now be seen the next crop
must be short. Should the rains however
be copious through September there might
still be time for a late crop. At present,
in a few provinces, the prospects are rather
encouraging, but in most places they are
on the contrary very discouraging. We
have certainly had a singular season so far.
During the months of July and August
we have not had what would be called in
an ordinary year a good shower of rain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The sky appears to be b?e?am above us, and
a cool strong dry wind from the South
West prevails. Some times a cloud ap-
pears which promises a copious shower,
but soon passes off with a blast of wind
and a few drops of rain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In regard to the rice crop however, it
must be taken into consideration that there
is about twice the usual amount of ground
under cultivation this year, and should
there only be an average of half a crop
through the country it will amount to an
ordinary crop other years.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The Oil Question.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The oil monopoly it would appear is not
yet quite settled. Some time since an officer
ordered those engaged in making oil to drop
operations at once, as the business had be-
come a monopoly. It was of course the bu-
siness of those representing the Treaty Pow-
ers to take exception to such a course. It
was however argued by the Siamese, in just-
ification of their course that it was indeed
better for all parties to remove the tax from
the cocoanut tree and place it upon the oil.
That in consequence of a high tax imposed
directly upon the tree the cocoanut have
suffered to decline and new ones were not
planted in the place of those which had
died. Their arguments were indeed plaus-
ible, for we all know that the farther a tax
can be removed from the producer and the
nearer it can be brought to the consumer,
the better for the former, and the more
encouragement given to him, the greater
would be the production. That the matter
rest here, and there be no abuse of the
monopoly, we suppose the Treaty Powers
would be satisfied. There is however likely
to be an abuse of the matter [....] [....]
Garden taxes here are of two kinds.  The
one is assessed on certain fruit trees. Then
one during a reign, unless the reign be a
a very long one.  This tax although imposed
only once during a reign, is collected an-
nually, and by the government [....] di-
rectly.  The other tax is an assessed tax
that is, it is both assessed, and collected
every year, on plantains, jack fruit and
some other trees not included in the
list of the long assessment. It, too, is not
collected by the government directly as the
other, but is farmed out. The news now is,
that the cocoanut is to be taken out of the
list of the long assessment, and placed on
the list of the annual assessment, and that
when this is done there is a person ready
to bid for the farm. A decree has also
gone forth (we know not from whom) that
garden owners must immediately plant co-
coanut trees in the places of those which
have died, and they are hastening to com-
ply.  If this measure is carried out, it will
readily be perceived that the oil will come
to the consumer burdened with a double
tax.{{< /news/text >}}

A PROCLAMATION.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}CHOW PHYA PRAK'LANG Min-
ister of Foreign affairs, desires to publish
for the information of all whom it may
concern the following PROCLAMA-
TION.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On a former occasion I was required by
the Siamese government to inform you by
a written PROCLAMATION, that in the year of
the Rat [the last year] throughout the King-
dom of Siam, there were localities where
the water was over-abundant, and conse-
quently the fields could not be made to pro-
duce rice—-and other localities where the
water was quite insufficient and hence a
failure of the crop, the people became much
alarmed fearing famine prices of the grain,
consequently the government resolved to
interdict the exportation of Rice from the
second month [corresponding with the 28th
Dec. 1864] until the end of the 9th month
(corresponding with the 20th inst.) And
that then, if on investigation it should be
found that the rains are abundant and that
the people are enabled to plant rice plenti-
fully, the interdiction shall be removed so
that Merchants shall be allowed to trade in
the same. But on the other hand, if there
shall be then, a drought, or if the rains shall
be in great excess, preventing the growth
of rice the government will have to con-
tinue to interdict the sale of the grain an-
other year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now it appears from the reports of
the governors of the Provinces at the South
and the North, that in some of the Pro-
vinces the rains have fallen in too small
quantities to overflow the rice fields, and
that consequently the planters have not yet
been able to plant their fields with success.
In some Provinces the rains have been suffi-
cient to grow the young rice plants with
good hopes of a crop.  In districts where
the rice is sown, as in the Province of A-
yudia, the farmers have ploughed their
fields and got ready to sow, but the rain is
yet too little to cover the fields with water.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would appear that rain in the northern
Provinces has not fallen in sufficient abun-
dance to cause the river in the Southern
districts to overflow its banks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If the water from the North does not
come down and flow over the rice fields and
nourish the young plants they will per-
ish as was the case last year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But if the northern water shall be suf-
ficient in the course of the 10th, 11th and
12th months (corresponding with the last
ten days of August and the whole of Septem-
ber and October) to overflow the rice
fields, a fair crop will be obtained.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Should however the water be insufficient,
as happened last year, the government are
unanimous in the opinion that the price of
rice in Siam is now [ a period of about 10
months ] higher than it has been, and that
the grain now stored in graneries is nearly
exhausted. In some of the Provinces where
the rice growers have been able to plant
their fields successfully, the restrictions in
the rice trade have already been removed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Government has therefore ordered me to
inform you that there will be no order to
interdict the exportation of rice another
year. But the matter will be left to the
option of the seller and purchaser to sell or
purchase as they shall judge it most profitable
for themselves. Government only requests to
take the usual custom on the grain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Moreover government learns that in China
and other places rice is cheaper than in
Bangkok. Now if Merchants in their several
spheres will import rice for sale in Siam, the
usual import custom of three per cent
shall not be demanded. But other imports
shall still continue to pay duty according
to the Treaties.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Issued on the 1st day of the waxing
moon of the 10th month, corresponding
to August 22d 1865.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
To the Editor of the "Bangkok Recorder"
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir.—Through the medium of your co-
lumns I beg to call attention to a subject
of some importance to the Kings and peo-
ple of Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A short time ago it was arranged to re-
place the circulation of Cowries by Ats and
Lots. This was no doubt in imitation of
foreign countries which use coins such as
pence, cents, and sone, which are coins well
known and highly approved of, and the
H. M. the king showed great wisdom and
knowledge, of the custom of distant com-
tries. But these Ats and Lots being made
of such Metal as Tin or Lead it was not
only easy for evil disposed persons to coun-
terfeit them, but there was temptation thrown
in their way, by the great profit likely to
accrue, and in proof of this we have merely
to consider well known facts. For instance,
the Government give in exchange 64 Ats
for one tical or 8 for a fuang, but the coun-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}terfeiters sell 100 Ats for ⅞ths of a tical and
consequently a large amount of base coin
has found its way into circulation. By the
laws of Siam forgers are liable to very severe
penalties, but so long as it is easy to coun-
terfeit and great profits can be made, the
fear of punishment will be found insufficient
to arrest the evil. I foresee that great diffi-
culties will result from the use of this lead
money, and therefore would suggest that
instead of it the small coins should be made
of copper, and in such a way that it would
be difficult to imitate them. Amongst the
valuable considerations, in favor of the use
of copper money, may be mentioned the
length of time that it will wear and retain
the impressions made upon it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It seems to me that the making of coins
of copper instead of lead would accomplish
the object which H. M. the King had in
view in making the Ats and Lots, but
which is not yet fulfilled, and would prove
to future generations H. M.'s consideration
for the prosperity of his kingdom. This cop-
per coinage would be of such a nature that
subsequent rulers of the country could not
fail to see its great advantages, and would
therefore not think of making any altera-
tion in the currency, from the conviction
that they could not improve it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With a view speedily to remedy this de-
fect, I propose that in consideration of a
payment of 400 catties annually, His Ma-
jesty should grant for ten years the right
to supply copper or bronze coins, of the
same nominal value as those of lead now
current, and which would intrinsically re-
present such a value that it would be im-
possible to make a profit by imitating them,
hence the evil now felt would cease.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now that I have ventured on the ex-
pression of my opinion, allow me to invite
your readers to give theirs in the next is-
sue of your paper; and should there be any
more feasible proposition made, it is to be
hoped that all, who have it in their power,
will assist in its accomplishment instead of
throwing obstacles in the way; but if there is
nothing better proposed I hope that my
suggestions may be carried into effect with-
out delay.{{< /news/text >}}

Garden Rambles in Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 151)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Largest of all the fruits of our little
domain is the jack, a species of bread-
fruit. It grows on the trunk and larger
branches of a lofty, spreading, and dark-
green, oval-leated tree. Appearing four or
five at once and as many tens annually it,
reaches & foot in diameter and one and a
half in length, and requires protection from
premature fall and frugiverous birds. The
rough green rind incloses numerous kernels
or nuts, which are covered with a rich,
cream-colored and very odoriferous fruit,
quite agreeable but laxative. Those nuts
are sometimes roasted. The wood of the
tree, fustic, is used in the yellow dyeing of
priests' robes. The bread-fruit proper is
the smaller and nearly rounded fruit of a low-
tree, of forty-five to fifty feet, with ser-
rate leaf. Though in taste, nutrition and
otherwise well named, it is coarse, and,
even prepared with palm-sugar and cocoa-
milk, not very attractive to native or for-
eigner.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Most esteemed by the Siameses, of all the
fruit-bearers, is the durian. It resembles its
neighbor the jack, but is more lofty, and
sends out its more numerous branches more
at right angles. The fruit hanging in scores,
is an oblong oval of five by seven inches,
with rind rising in high, hard points, which,
not to mention the force of gravity, make
its unseeen fall somewhat to be feared.
When ripe, it bursts the tough rind and
discloses four lobes, each containing sever-
al nuts, and all enveloped in a nearly white,
soft pulp. This is the most delicious of the
delicious, the concentrated, subliminated
quintessence of deliciousness to native taste.
But for the foreign novitiate, the odor, the
stench of the durian sufficeth. Compared
unto it, antiquated eggs, rotting fish, sauer-
kraut, all together, are but the perfumed
breath of the sweetest conservatory. It has
been likened to assafoetida, to the stink of
various and onions mingled, to a mixture
of sulphureted hydrogen gas and garlic;
we would liken it to the whole combined.
You can detect the presence of one in a
distant part of the house; a boat load a
fourth of a mile. The organ of smell, long
and painfully disciplined to a reluctant ac-
quiescence, few can even then taste it with
out having peculiar gastric symptoms which
recall first experiences at sea. But the two-
fold ordeal past, many become fond, pas-
sionately fond of the durian, and marvellous
is the number which they boast of daily
eating. It is the most expenssive of fruits
and its presentation is regarded as a token
of warm friendship and highest considera-
tion. An old traveller, discovering very
quaintly and somewhat fancifully of the
durian, in connection with the betel, says:
'In Malacca there is a fruit so pleasant both
for taste and small, that it excelleth all
other fruits, both of India and Malacca, al-
though there are many both excellent and
very good. This fruit is hot and moist;
and such as will eat them, must first treadle
upon them softly with his foote and breake
the prickers that are about them. Siroh as
never eate of it before, when they smell it
at the first, thinke it scenteth like a rotten
onyon; but having tasted it, they esteeme it
above all other fruites, both for taste and
savor. Here you must note a wonderful
contrarietie that is between this fruit dur-
ian and the bearbe bettele; which in truth
is so great, that if there were a whole ship-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}pe, shoppe, or house full of duriaens,
wherein there lay certaine leaves of bettele,
all the duriaens would presently rette
and bee spoyled. And likewise, by eating over
many of those duriaens, they heat the maw
and make it swell: and one leaf of bettele,
to the contrairie, being laid cold upon the
heart, will presently cease the inflammation,
rising or swelling of the maw. And so, if
after you have eaten duriaens, you chance
to eat a leaf or two of bettele, you can re-
ceive no hurt by the duriaens, although
your stomach never so many. Hereupon,
and because they are of so pleasant a taste,
the common saying is, that men can never
be satisfied with them. The mangosteen
to us, however, the nonpareil of tropic
fruits. The tree, more nearly than any
other of the East, resembles the apple-tree,
and the abundant fruit is about the size of
a medium greening. The rind, dark brown
without and beautiful vermilion within, has
a very bitter juice, which is used as an
astringent in medicine and a black mordant
in dyeing. The lobes, (in number indicated
before opening by the divisions of the per-
manent peltate stigma which crowns the
fruit) with each a seed, are of the purest
white and the most delicate, exquisite,
strawberry-like flavor. Healthful as delight-
ful, there is scarce any limit to the enjoy-
ment of mangoesteens.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Very like in appearance to the strawber-
ry, at a distance, is the rambutan. Its
large clusters in rich profusion and scarlet,
dapple the green leaves of the fine tree, like
the early colorings of the autumnal maple.
The fruit is a drupe, of the size of a medium
plum, with a tough, hairy (as its Malay
name denotes) skin, and a semi-transparent
and pleasant pulp containing a stone. Hard
by grow the maprang, with its thousands
of smooth golden plums, quite resembling
our largest and best.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The pomelo, with its pretty white blos-
soms of orange fragrance, shining out from
dark leaves, and four-score fruit, invited us
to pluck from our veranda. Stripped of its
rind, this great orange is a pale white or a
reddish, according to variety, and though
rather bitter, is more refreshing and tonic
than the same fruit known as the shaddock
(from the ship-master Shaddock who in-
troduced it) of the West-Indies. The thick
rind is often used as that of melons else-
where, as a medium for eating sugar. The
pine-apple abounds in the country; but
some predatory hand always relieved us
from eating our own. They are inferior to
those at Singapore, which indeed are un-
rivalled in lusciousness and cheapness, the
choicest in the world being frequently re-
tailed 'two for a penny.' While there, one
day sitting in the office of a Chinese mer-
chant, we saw on the quay a group of four
boat-coolies pare and internally pack away
in about ten minutes a pile of over twenty
large pine-apples, without any manifest con-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}sciousness whatever of heroic or painful a-
chievement. The custard-apple, of the size
of a large peach, with greenish, soft, far-
rowed, fragile skin, and, barring the many
dark seeds, very custard-like pulp, is ex-
ceedingly choice. Of the same genus with
this, the papaya and sour-sop are of the size
and color of a medium musk-melon, the
one sweet and aromatic, the other more
juicy and tart. The guava grows on a tree
twenty-five to thirty feet high, with light
green leaves and large white flowers. It is
conical, smaller than the quince, to which
it is often, compared, of not pleasant smell,
but stewed, preserved or jellied, of very fine
flavor. Like the banana and cocoa-not
when seen in northern markets, this fam-
ous jelly gives little idea of its fresh deli-
ciousness at home. Less even does that
prized pickle, the mango, realize to one the
ripe fruit of the gulf-side of Siam. The tree
attains to sixty feet, and to three in diam-
eter, with large spreading branches, long,
narrow, deep-green leaf, and small, white
blossom; it would remind you of the oak.
The fruit, a drupe with smooth skin and
large hairy stone, is three to five inches
long, two and a half inches wide, and one
to two thick. Unripe, it is used for pies
and puddings, resembling a sour green ap-
ple. But in its fall, golden, luscious yel-
low ripeness, it rivals the durian and man-
gosteen, and the finest peach.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The tamarind, towering eighty to one
hundred feet, with large, far-reaching bran-
ches, thick green foliage, clusters of yel-
low crimson-veined flowers, and dark green
pods, is the pride of the forest, and of pa-
laces and temple-grounds. The acidulous
fruit, from the pods, is almost an essential
for the table, in curries and pastry, and as
a sauce for rice and meats. A beverage
distinctly cooling and refreshing, especi-
ally in sickness, is made from it, and it is
at all times valuable as a mild aperient.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such were some of the fruits and trees to
be found within a five minutes walk from
our bamboo cottage. They are but a few
of the long, rich, varied catalogne of the
country. The pomegranate, with its frag-
rant scarlet blossoms and mildly acid flav-
or; the orange, in twenty varieties, to
which acres on the Menam are devoted;
the lime, the excellent substitute for lemons;
the citron, the musk and water-melon; the
mienglak, a half tea-spoon of which (no
larger than a small shot) put into a very
little water, will presently fill the tumbler
with an agreeable drink; the lychee, the
rose-apple, the cashew, and many others of
name and natur more novel, we must pass.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Scarcely less famed are the gardens of
Siam for vegetables. The great cereal and
staple of the country is rice. 'Hot corn!
hot corn!' cries the itinerant huckster,
laden with ears smoking in their green
husks; the snowy popped, too, and that
roasted, cut from the ear and sugared, find
much appreciative taste. But Indian corn
is little cultivated, and never for flour or
feeding. Far better, perfectly adapted to
tropic use, is that which the all-wise PRO-,
VIDENCE furnishes in such overflowing
abundance. Nowhere is the culture of rice
more facile or fruitful than in these rich,
warm, moist, at times, dain? unwatered
lowlands. The moderate labors of the
natives are repaid thirty to fifty-fold; the
export, should not more than one third of
the land be cultivated, and one crop instead
of the other two possible, is immense. Under
late treaties, the only official bar to export
is a failure of crop and threatened famine
(!) with royal proclamation thereof. There
are nearly as many varieties of wheat;
the highlands are much smaller and lighter,
the lowland more certain and prolific.
The more extensive rice fields lie on the
banks of the rivers or canals, and are first
cleared by axe and fire of trees and roots,
then surrounded by low embankments or
ridges of earth, with entering trenches. A
plough, hardly larger than one's hand, six
inches long and four wide at the top,
tapering round to the point, with a crooked
stick for beam and handle, and a buffalo
for team, scratches the ground to the depth
of three or four inches. This is followed
by a harrow, consisting of large boughs or
a small tree. In the soil thus prepared
the rice plants are in July or early August
transplanted from the smaller sowing plates,
the workmen as they walk, with foot or sick
making holes in the soft wet earth and
thrusting in handfuls. At flood-tide the
water is let in by the trenches, and the gates
are shut. In localities not easily thus reach-
ed, men, with large wooden scoops suspen-
ded from a frame, aid the filling of the tren-
ches. Or yet again you may sometimes see
the 'watering with the foot.' A large double
box or trough is placed on the bank at an
angle of forty-five degrees, or less. Through
this runs by a wheel at the head, an endless
chain with wooden paddles or floats, which
carry the water up through the under box,
and return empty through the upper. The
wheel is turned by men treading steps or
cogs in its long axle, and balancing them-
selves by aid of a bar before them. This
mode of irrigation is almost identical with
that described centuries ago by Philo.
The rice is kept under water till the kernel
is formed. The grain is cut about mid-
December, with a crooked, unseparated
stick, and is trodden out by buffaloes and
oxen, or on a smaller scale, beaten out
against the sides of the receiving boxes by
hand. It is winnowed by the wind and
basket-sieves or fans machines now common.
Table-rice is hulled by women and children
treading on the short arm of a long, hard-
headed lever playing in a frame, and farther
by pounding in mortars with pestles a
couple of yards long. It was retailed by
the itinerant boats at about thirty cents
per bucket of twenty quarts, or thirty
pounds good quality and measure. 'Cargo'
passes through the paddy mills, which are
largely owned and worked by Chinese.
The mill, of which there are several in one
establishment, consists of a heavy wooden
cylinder with grooved bottom, revolved
by horizontal hand-cranks on another
grooved block inclosed in basket-work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Paddy (unhulled rice) is also con-
siderable exports. Rice is the chief food
of the people. It is sometimes, though
rarely, ground, and then, as also our wheat
from Singapore, in the Scriptural manner,
by 'two women grinding at the mill', or
quern. Usually it is boiled, after washing
two or three times, for five or eight minutes,
then the water poured off, allowed to steam
in the same coarse earthen pot, over
gentle fire, for three-quarters of an hour.
Not softened to a paste, the kernel kept
whole, of the purest white, the rice does
not soil the fingers of those who use no
spoon, and has a tempting, and with the
golden curry beside it, irresistible look for
all. A very glutinous rice, with spices
conjured into a kind of cake, fermented,
and wrapped in bits of green plantain-leaf,
is sold by the street-side, admired by juv-
eniles, and not to be despised by adults,
native or foreign. From rice is distilled
the vile arrak, the principal intoxicating
beverage of the country.{{< /news/text >}}

GENERAL SUMMARY.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}No scene more striking or impressive can
be conceived in a free country than the dis-
solution of one Parliament, and the imme-
diate arrangements made for summoning
another. The constitution provides for a
full representation of the people, and usage
prescribes that the legislative body shall
renewed without fail as often as its term
shall have lapsed. On the 6th July the
two Houses met, and heard the Queen's
Speech, in which her Majesty informed
them that the electors of the United King-
dom would soon be called upon again to
choose their representatives, adding a so-
lemn prayer that a blessing might attend
their proceedings. From this point of de-
parture, the elections may be said to have
been set in motion. On the same evening
the new writs were issued, and within a
week's time the constituencies will have re-
turned their representatives, the excitement
will be over, and the great constitutional
right, by which the people impart practical
force to public opinion, will have been dis-
charged, without the slightest attempt being
made to control or pervert it by the authori-
ties. The contrast with the course of
French election, which has hitherto been a
fruitless contest between power and the
masses, is not the least important reflection
our English system suggests. Whatever
inconvenience may accrue from a general
election; it affords at least satisfactory evid-
ence of the electors. So long as society
exists in its present forms, influences must
continue to operate in some quarters, nor
can the most stringent legislation reach
them; but what is common to society at
large, cannot be urged as an objection to
any particular social development; and the
elections in England yield conclusive proofs
that there is as much liberty of action
amongst the electors as can co-exist with
the conflict of interests and views seeking
to be represented.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Speech from the Throne, delivered
by Commission, consisted mainly of con-
gratulations on the seal of Parliament and
an historical retrospect of the labours of the
Session. Her Majesty rejoices at the "con-
tinued tranquillity and increasing prosperi-
ty" of India—phrases which may be con-
dered by some people open to question—
and she regrets that the conferences with
the North American provinces have not led
to a satisfactory result; her Majesty rejoices
also that the war in America is over, and
is happy to say that she is on friendly re-
lations with foreign Powers; and then turn-
ing to the actual work of Session, she enu-
merates with justifiable approbation some
of the most important measures that have
been carried.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As there was nothing in this Speech to
call up the animosities of faction, as there
really no question before the constituen-
cies to give point to the elections. Reform
will be attempted, but it is only in particu-
lar places it is likely to turn a vote one way
or the other. The Church in many places
will be turned to account: and where Ro-
man Catholics most do congregate, Lord
Derby's injurious speech on the Oath—
Bill will, probably, damage the Conserva-
tives; but elsewhere, there will be little cap-
ital made out of the Church on either side.
Considering the absence of salient topics,
the elections are likely to be contested with
extraordinary animation. Wars and rum-
ours of wars are surging up around us; and
at the eleventh hour new candidates are
coming forward to vindicate the interests
of a party, or, in the verbiage of that style
of address which means nothing, to enable
independent electors to record their votes.
We do not remember on any former occas-
sion so many candidates in the field, or so
many formidable attempts to rout the Liber-
als in their strongholds. Amongst the
changes of seats which the new Parliament
will witness, that of Sir Charles Wood will
conspicuous. An effort has been made to
set him up again for Halifax, but Colonel
Akroyd not having manifested the least in-
tention of retiring, Sir Charles Wood has
steadily declined to stand again; and, for a
final refuge, thrown himself into the arms
of the electors of Ripon. In the metropoli
tan boroughs, and even in Westminster, the
City of London, and Middlesex, close bat-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}tles are expected, and prophecies of unto-
ward events are freely circulated. But the
issue is so close at hand, that it is scarcely
worth while to indulge in such speculations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the midst of this political excitement
comes the case of Lord Westbury, which
has afforded occupation to two Parliamen-
tary Committees, and been treated with ex-
aggerated heat in the hope of damaging the
administration on the eve of the election.
The virtuous indignation of the Conservative
party which was expanded on that expect-
ation has failed. The more the charges
against Lord Westbury were investigated,
the more it became obvious that he had
acted with culpable indifference to the strict
administration of his grave functions, but
that he had not done so from corrupt mo-
tives. He had in fact gained nothing by
his misplaced leniency to official men who
deserved dismiss'd and received pensions at
his hands; but he had brought such discre-
dit on his high office, as to render it neces-
sary that he should resign. This was, in
effect, the substance of a vote of the House
of Commons, acquiesced in without a div-
ision by Lord Palmerston. It expressed
what must be regarded as the judgment of
the public, and the Government wisely ac-
cepted it as final. On the following morning
Lord Westbury placed his resignation in the
hands of the Prime Minister, and it is only
justice to him to add that he had been an-
xious to resign at an earlier period, but was
overruled by Lord Palmerston. No soon-
er had the offending functionary retired,
than the scandal went down into oblivion,
and the brief speech in which his lordship
took leave of the Wool sack was listened to
with profound attention. Lord Cranworth
has been appointed his successor. By this
appointment the country will be saved a
pension, and the labours of the Keeper of the
Seals will be confided to a man in whose
experience and competency all parties will
feel confidence. Lord Cranworth is 75
years of age, but is in perfect possession of
his mental and physical powers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Almost the only scrap of news from
abroad that calls for special record is a re-
petition of the rumour that negotiations are
in progress for the recognition of Italy by
Spain—an arrangement to which the Pope
is said to offer no opposition. In all these
initial movements for a better understand-
ing amongst the governments of Europe,
his Holiness shows a most complying dis-
position; but when matters approach the
settlement of details, as in the case of the
Italian bishops, the antagonist spirit comes
It is natual enough, considering the
traditions of the Vatican, that the Pope
should be unwilling to part with the last
shreds of his dominion over the Kings of
the earth; and we should, therefore, prize
all the more such concessions as he has
manifested a disposition to approve.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Schleswig-Holstein dispute deepens
between Austria and Prussia.  Austria has
offered terms to Prussia, which Prussia has
indignantly rejected, although they includ-
ed the recognition of Kiel as a Prussian
naval station, and Rendsburg as a Federal
fortress with a Prussian garrison, conces-
sions which Austria never should have
made, and which it is fornuate Prussia has
refused. Herr von Bismarck's views with
respect to the Duchies appear to have be-
come more exorbitant in proportion as Aus-
tria has become more disinclined to give
up the claims of the Duke, and he has ac-
cordingly, not only declined to diminish
the number of his troops in the Duchies,
but refused to allow the people to express
by public demonstrations their wishes as to
their future sovereign.  He has gone so far
as to direct that martial law shall be pro-
claimed on the first attempt to make a de-
monstration in favour of the Duke of Au-
gustenburg.  In this case, what can Austria
do? Literally nothing.  She has remon-
strated; But her remonstrances are waste-
paper.  Prussia occupies the Duchies, and
will keep them at the point of the sword.
Nothing short of a war will expel her; and
who is to take the initiative?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The experiment of the new Austrian
Cabinet has not yet been long enough in
operation to enable the world to judge of its
probable fate.  It is something, however,
to know that it is in favour of more liberal
views than its predecessor, and that, for the
first time, a serious and sincere attempt will
be made to find out a path to reconciliation
with Hungary.  The merit of this import-
ant movement belongs exclusively to the
Emperor, who, having on his return from
Pesh, communicated to Von Schmerling
his desire to terminate the provisional state
of things in Hungary, and finding that the
minister was opposed to his views, announ-
ced his determination to take the matter
into his own hands. This was as much as
to intimate to Von Schmerling the neces-
sity of resigning, to make room for an ad-
ministration prepared to carry out his Maj-
esty's policy. The hint was taken, and the
new ministry have taken office with a full
consciousness of the responsibility before
them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After occupying nearly a week, the trial
of Dr. Pritchard, in Glasgow, for poisoning
his wife and his wife's mother, has been
brought to a close. The medical evidence was
conclusive as to the fact of poisoning, which
had been evidently going on slowly for some
time. There were only two persons who,
from their position in the house, were open
to suspicion-—a young servant girl with
whom Dr. Pritchard had formed a crimin-
al intimacy, and to whom he had promised
marriage in the event of his wife's death;
and Dr. Pritchard himself. With respect
to the former, no criminating circumstances
were brought to light; but, with respect to
the latter, although no adequate motive
could be traced for the commission of the
murders, and notwithstanding that the re-
latives of the murdered ladies appeared on
his behalf, there were certain incidents
which left no moral doubt of his guilt—-he
alone had an interest in their death, and
only he could have poisoned them as they
were poisoned; he misrepresented their ill-
ness, and made false reports to the registrar.
After an absence of an hour from court, the
jury found the prisoner guilty, and the judges
sentenced him to be executed on July 28.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Intelligence from New York to the noon
of the 28th June says:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Advices from the South describe the
desolation marking the line of Sherman's
march, and all the adjacent country. The
inhabitants are threatened with starvation,
as nearly all barns and farming implements
have been destroyed and the live stock
driven off. General Wilson telegraphs that
he can with great difficulty procure scanty
rations for his men, and predicts a famine
unless supplies are at once sent to the de-
vastated regions. A correspondent of the
'New York Herald' represents the condit-
ion of South Carolina to be truly pitiable.
In Columbia, once considered the most
elegant city of its size in the country, the
inhabitants, from the highest to the lowest,
were existing in a condition of the most ab-
ject poverty, and no attempt was being
made to rebuild the city. The same cor-
respondent, whose account is indeed cor-
roborated by several others, states that the
people of that section admit themselves
conquered, but declare openly their hatred
for the North. It is said to be generally ad-
mitted that the planters, considering their
present condition, are better off without
their slaves. The mortality among the
freedmen is still reported to be very great,
although the authorities are making every
exertion to ameliorate their condition. In
Georgia and North Carolina the state of af-
fairs is rather more promising, but is never-
theless deplorable. A correspondent says—
Throughout this vast region the tall, black-
ened chimneys, obliterated railroads, the
ashes of barns and fences, misery and de-
solation mark the course of the avenging
army, and the prospect of the inhabitants
is truly poor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The report is confirmed that the health
of Mr. Jefferson Davis is much improved.
He is now allowed whatever food he wish-
es, but is still kept closely confined, and is
permitted the use of no books or papers be-
yond the Holy Bible and a Prayer-book.
Nothing further has transpired in relation
to his proposed trial for treason. "Mrs.
Davis," so says a correspondent of the
'New York Herald,' "is living in Savannah in a
destitute condition, without money or pro-
per clothing, and without any servant to
aid her in taking care of her young child-
ren."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The 'Richmond Bulletin' states that it
is reported to be a fact by men of influence
that James Gordon Bennett, of the 'New
York Herald,' in the beginning of the war,
wrote to Mr. Davis, the then Confederate
President, offering to support his govern-
ment for the sum of £50,000 sterling. The
'New York World' and 'New York News'
editorially endorse the truth of the state-
ment. The 'World' say, on the authority
of "a gentleman, whose word would not
be doubted were we to mention his name,"
that Mr. Bennett stipulated that the £50,
000 should be deposited to his credit a-
broad, and that the Confederate govern-
ment should indemnify him for any losses
sustained in advocating its cause, but that
Mr. Davis declined the offer, and favoured
the establishment of the London "Index."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}President Johnson was suffering from in-
disposition, resulting from excessive fatigue.
Mr. Frederick W. Seward was still improv-
ing, and was able to walk from one cham-

{{< news/text >}}It was reported that the Freedman's
Bureau has set apart a large quantity of
confiscated and abandoned land in the
South in tracts of various sizes, and in
various localities, for the especial benefit
of negroes. Not less than 100,000 are now
subsisting on government rations in the
State of Virginia alone.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The 'New York Herald' says:—"All
the trade restrictions of the war having
been removed from the late rebellious States,
including Arkansas, Western Louisiana,
and Texas, we may soon expect large ar-
rivals of cotton on the seaboard en route
for England. There are probably about as
many as 2,000,000 bales of cotton scattered
about in holes and corners throughout
the South, and those who have it to sell
and those who are seeking to buy should
assist each other in bringing it out; and
for the relief of the Southern people the
government in every available way should
assist them in getting their cotton to market,
and every other staple of Southern pro-
duce they may have to exchange for bread
and clothing. The necessities of the suffer-
ing Southern people are urgent, and call for
immediate relief. Thousands of those peo-
ple are famishing while the means of relief
are all around them, needing only purchas-
ers and bread and clothing in exchange."{{< /news/text >}}

Tuileries
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 145)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was about the middle of Nov. that one
of a number of workmen who had been em-
ployed to execute certain repairs in the
Tuileries, discovered an iron chest conceal-
ed in the wall of one of the rooms, which
being opened by order of the minister, was
found to contain papers relating to the rev-
olution. Upon a closer examination of
these manuscripts several of them turned
out to refer to certain projects of the royal-
ists for restoring the king's authority, and
even to intrigues, which had been entered
into for that purpose by the Court, with
some of the most eminent of the popular
leaders. These were the documents which
contained certain proofs of Mirabean's
treachery to the cause of the revolution.
The discovery and publication of the con-
tents of this iron chest had a most power-
ful effect in precipitating the sad fate of the
king. The business of bringing him to the
block was now a smooth and easy one. On
the 11th of Dec. he was called for the first
time to the bar of the Convention. He
made his appearance about 2 o'clock in the
afternoon. Having been permitted to place
himself in a chair, he was asked a succes-
sion of questions by the President, all of
which he answered with precision and com-
posure. The papers found in the iron chest,
and others on which the accusations against
him were founded, were then put one by
one into his hand, and he was asked in re-
gard to each if he acknowledged it. He
disavowed many of them. This examina-
tion lasted for three hours.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 25th Louis again appeared at the
bar, accompanied by his counsel M. M. de
Ma?herbes, Tronchet and Deseze, to make
his defence. On entering the Hall at eight
o'clock in the morning those Deputies who
were suspected of being favorably disposed
to the accused, were insulted by the people.
The galleries were also found to be filled
with people who had remained there all the
night previous.  The king on being called
up for his defense pointed to his counsel,
and M. Desdéy arose and addressed the
Convention in a speech distinguished by its
eloquence and fearlessness.  On its con-
clusion Louis again retired.  A very stormy
debate amidst fearful outcries then took
place.  Was Louis guilty or not guilty?
On this question all the members present,
six hundred and ninety three in number,
voted in the affirmative.  When it was as-
certained how the vote stood, the penalty
of death was pronounced by the Conven-
tion against Louis Capet.  The sentence
that passed on the king was a victory gained
by the Girondists the more violent party of
the Convention.  In the course of the next
three or four months, the legislative body
was subject to various attacks by the rabble.
of the Faubourg. One of the most memora-
ble of the days thus distinguished, was the
first of May when a mob of about two hun-
dred women first presented themselves at
the bar of the Convention, which was now
sitting in the Palace of the Tuileries. These
petitioners, as they called themselves, advan-
ced into the Hall with banners in their
hands, announcing their demands, and head-
ed by a leader who read an address, which
was intended to tell them, she said, "des
vérités dures," some hard truths. "You
republicans" also went on to say, "know
how to govern—Lile vagrants you make
promises but to break them. What have
you done since you have met in this Hall?"
After going on in this style for a consider-
able time, the orator concluded by inform-
ing the patient auditors that if their demands
were not immediately acceded to, she and
her followers declared themselves in a state
of insurrection. After having vented their
wrath in all manner of insult and outrage,
these women retired but to reappear again,
on the 37th. On that day an augmented
mob of fanatic furies, about 2.000 in num-
ber, presented themselves surrounding all
the entrances to the Legislative Chamber.
These petticoat politicians, were headed on
this occasion by a woman named Leonie,
and the circumstance of there being no men
among them gave occasion to its being said,
that assuredly, "était tombée en quenouille,"
had fallen to be inherited by the distaff, as
it may be translated. The debate was one
of unprecedented violence. The party named
the Mountain did not confine themselves
to their usual practice of roaring down their
opponents, in which on this occasion, they
were wonderfully aided by the shrill voices
of the women from without, and from the
gallery within, but some of them actually
laid other members prostrate by dealing
them blows on the breast with their clin-
ched fists, thus enforcing their propositions
by blows and the most furious outcries. It
was a scene of unparalleled outrage upon all
the forms of order and government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 31st the insurrection again broke
out in one of its most hidous aspects,
On that morning the tocsin sounded from
every steeple in Paris, and in every street
the drums beat to arms, and in a short time
a mob of infuriated women had collected
at every entrance to the Hall of the Con-
vention, by whom every member as he ap-
proached was subjected to abuse. Multitudes
of men too, armed with sticks and spikes,
and afterwards several bands of military,
arrived till at last it had grown into an im-
mense army. The Tuileries was on that
day besieged by a force of full eighty
thousand all of whom were armed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Convention had opened at 8 o'clock,
but the members assembled, are long found
themselves imprisoned within their Hall.
When any of them attempted to go forth,
they were met at the door by pointed bay-
onets and driven back, often with having had
their clothes torn off and severely beaten.
When the unfortunate representatives found
the state in which they were placed a vio-
lent debate arose,—Lanjuinais one of the
twenty five Girondist leaders, whose
heads had been demanded, by the popu-
lace, mounting the tribune, denounced with
vehement eloquence the ultra democratic
party who had instigated these terrible
excesses. "Legislators" he exclaimed, "the
truth is no longer to be disguised; another
authority has usurped your functions, and
you are now invested by its hired bands"
The members of the mountain here endea-
voured to drown the voice of the orator with
outcries of unparalleled fury—at last Legend-
re, a member of the mountain, sprung up
to the tribune, and placing himself by his side,
not only assailed him with the most pas-
sionate reproaches, but aimed a rapid suc-
cession of blows at his head with his clinch-
ed fist. On seeing this, a deputation
from the mob entered and demanded that
a number of the deputies whom they named,
should be surrendered to them. To elude if
possible the well understood aim of the
authors of this proposal, it was moved at
once that the obnoxious deputies should
voluntarily resign the powers with which
they were invested, into the hands of the
mob, who would then take them under their
protection.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As soon as they had once more taken
their seats, Couthon rose, and pointing to
the vacated seats observed, with matchless
effrontary, that from all they had just seen
the assembly must at last be convinced that
their deliberations were perfectly free. This
ready acquiescence in their own degradation.
was however of little avail in saving them
from a worse fate. Within a few months
all of them were brought to the guillotine.
And thus terminated a day which may be
described as one of the most humiliating in
the annals of France. The succeeding four-
teen months form the dark period of the
domination of Robespierre, of which we
intend hereafter to give a sketch in conec-
tion with the Place Louis XV.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the abolition of Royalty the garden
of the Tuileries received the name of the
National garden. It was here that imposingly
famous and blasphemous festival to the sup-
reme Being was celebrated on the 8th June
1794.—"The day was serene and beautiful,
the sun rose with a grandeur unparalleled,
even in the far east, the air was soft and
mild as when Zephyrs on Flora breathes,
and all nature was hushed into stillness if
not into repose," says our disarming histor-
ian. "The furious throngs of angry men
and women rushing hither and thither with
frantic cries and curses were no longer
heard. The hellish war of the inhuman mob
had indeed subsided, but alas twas only to
sleep off the intoxication of the night
in order to fit them for the blacker crime
of the succeeding day. " At the moment of
sunrise military music and the rapid firing
of cannon, announced the coming solem-
nity. Very soon bands of men, women and
children were seen approaching from the
different sections, the men bearing branches
of oak, and the women and children bou-
quetes of flowers in their hands-while along
the streets through which they passed all
the fronts of the houses were being hung
with blooming garlands, tricolored banners,
or draperies. The different columns of the
people had arranged themselves in a station
appointed for them at a short distance from
the palace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The members of the Convention then
came forth in procession from the central
pavilion preceded by a numerous band of
musicians and took their places in an ele-
vated spacious amphitheatre which had
been erected against the palace wall. Rob-
espierre as President, then rose and mount-
ing a rostrum, delivered an address spe-
cious and flattering to the people, in com-
mendation of the new religion, " The
French National Faith" the establish-
ment of which they had met together, as a
nation, solemnly to celebrate. A symphony
performed by several bands of musicians
followed his oration. When this was over
Robespierre taking a lighted torch in his
hand descended from the amphitheatre and
advanced towards a group of figures repre-
senting Atheism, Ambition, Egoism, and
Discord, which stood together in the cir-
cular basis of the parterre, and applying his
torch to this allegorical group he set it on
fire. The figures disappeared in a blaze,
and the cloud of smoke that succeeded
gradually cleared away there were seen em-
erging from the bright and majestic figure of
Wisdom. After this spectacle Robespierre
again harangued the people. Tho whole As-
sembly then marched in procession with
music playing and banners flying to the
Champ de Mars, or as it was then called the
Champ de la Reunion, where other cerimo-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/right >}}
* Exquises Historiques.
{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}nies were performed and hymns chanted.
They afterwards returned to the Tuileries
in similiar array, where they passed the
entire day in dancing and other festivities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The pride, pomp and circumstance of
this impious festival had hardly vanished
from the gaze of this giddy people, when
the first mutterings became audible of the
tempest that was to overthrow Robespierre
and his associates, and restore once more
something like liberty and hope to France.
The leaders of the people were everywhere
triumphant—sixty of the unfortunate dep-
uties were condemned and executed on
the guillotine.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another military demonstration, and the
last we would here mention in concluding
our sketch of the Tuileries, occurred on the
famous 18th Brumaire, the 8th or 9th Nov.
1799, when Bonaparte seized the govern-
ment, and compelled the new Assembly to
transfer its sitting elsewhere. The palace
of the Tuileries soon after became the resi-
dence of Bonaparte, and ere long its Halls
were once more revisited by the pomp and
brilliancy of a Court. The spirit of the old
system, however, continued nearly unim-
paired throughout the whole of his day,
and even to the present reign; and many
sagacious observers are not without their
anticipations of a coming revolution in
France. In a work of some celebrity "Plato
Redivivus" lately revised by one of our
old English republicans, the author in the
course of his great argument says "that all
good and stable governments is necessaril-
ly founded on the recognition of the rights
of the people;" Having occasion to refer to
the case of France, he remarks "we may sup-
pose that the great power of the Emperor
of France must diminish much when his
enraged and oppressed subjects come to be
commanded by a ruler of less tact, wisdom
and military virtue. It will be very difficult
for any such prince to govern tyrannically a
country not entirely his own.” He after-
wards in examining the subject at greater
length characterizes the existing French
government as one of those violent states
which the Grecians designated “Tyrannes”
and proceeds to prove, that such a govern-
ment being violent, is not natural, but con-
trary to the interests of the people, and
cannot be lasting, but must fail when the
adventitious props which support it fail,-and
that whilst it does endure it must be very
uneasy both to prince and people,—the form-
er being necessitated to continued acts of
oppression, and the latter to suffer them.{{< /news/text >}}

People's Names.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are above a quarter of million of
persons in England and Wales bearing the
cosmopolitan surname of Smith, and above
45,000 persons in Scotland. If you meet
seventy-three persons in England, or even
sixty-eight in Scotland, you may expect to
find a Smith among them. Next to Smith
there comes in each country a purely local
name - Jones in England and Wales, Mac-
donald in Scotland; in every seventy-eight
persons in Scotland there is a Macdonald.
The next most common names in England
are: Williams, Taylor, Davis, and Brown;
in Scotland, Brown occupies a very high
numerical position, but several purely Scot-
tish names also stand high upon the list—
Robertson, Stewart, Campbell, Anderson.
There is a much greater clan predominance
of surnames in Scotland than in England.
There are in both countries many surnames
derived from occupation, locality, or per-
sonal qualities; while in England, in the
fifty most common surnames, only twenty-
seven, in Scotland, thirty-seven—the great
majority—are real patronymics and truly
surnames, either in their pure, unaltered
state, as Grant, Cameron, &c., or altered so
as to express the descent, as in Robertson
and Morrison, or with the Gaelic Mac. A
recent examination of the birth register of
Scotland for a year showed 104,018 births
and only 6,823 surnames; so that there
are more than 15 persons, upon an average,
to a surname, or only 6.5 surnames, to 100
persons. In England, a similar examina-
tion by the Registrar-General showed only
8.4 persons to a surname, or 12 surnames
to 100 persons. The proportion of persons
attached to each surname would have been
still larger in Scotland, and more than
double that of England, but for the im-
mense immigration from Ireland in the last
quarter of a century. In the Scottish reg-
isters the 50 most common surnames em-
brace nearly 30 [per]cent. of all the names
on the register; in England only about 18
[per]cent. Of the 50 most common surnames
in Scotland, 32 either entirely or in the
form in which they occur in Scotland may
be reckoned as having originated in that
country and as being peculiar to it—a very
large proportion, considering all circum-
stance. The remainder are common also
to England. The sobringets perpetuated
as surnames from a supposed likeness to
the animal creation of course vary in Eng-
land and Scotland with the language of
each country. English Fox is superseded
in Scotland by Tod, a very common name,
having the same meaning. Bullock be-
comes Stott, and Crow Craw. Hogg in
Scotland is not to be traced to pig, but a
lamb a year old. Mr. Stock, of the Scot-
tish Register office, from whose Sixth An-
nual Report (just issued) these statements
are taken, has also had the curiosity to
note the Christian names, occurring upon
the registers. In 3,590 entries of births
of boys there were only 67 different Chris-
tian names, but among alike number of
girls there were 86. John and James great-
ly preponderate among the boys. Among
the girls Margaret is the favorite name, but
Mary is very close to it. In the Highland
clans Mary decidedly preponderates, but
Margaret in all other parts of Scotland.
Several names not uncommon among girls
in England did not occur as many as three
times in the entire Scottish list of 3,680
—Beatrice, Clara, Emma, Julia, Lucy; and
among the 3,690 boys there were not three
with either of several of our common Eng-
lish names—Alfred, Arthur, Benjamin,
Frederick, Philip, Stephen. The girls' list
shows many variations from what we should
find in England; there are twice as many
Elspeths as Emilys, twice as many Mar-
jorys as Louisas, four times as many Euph-
emias as Harriets, five times as many Graces
as Carolines.{{< /news/text >}}

A Distinguished Southerner.—-
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}  The New-York Sun, of May 25th, says:
"Yesterday a distinguished rebel, long in
the 'Confederate service at Richmond, ap-
peared in our streets, attracting a good
deal of attention from spectators, namely,
the famous Russian bloodhound 'Hero',
who during the war had helped to guard
the prisoners in Castle Thunder, and be-
sides barking at Southern Union men, had
been taught to growl at a Federal uniform
whenever seen and by whomsoever worn.
He has got over that since his capture and
parole under the terms of Lee's surrender.
'Hero' is four feet in height, and can
readily take his food from an ordinary
table. He measures seven feet from his
nose to the tip of his tail, and forty-two
inches round the chest, and weighs 180
pounds. Ten pounds of beef and as much
mutton, with half a gallon of water, are
consumed by this brute at one meal, and
the way he shows his teeth is annoying to
nervous people. He belonged to one of
the F. F. V.'s, but has been duly confiscat-
ed to the U. S. authorities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"FACT, gentlemen," said a traveler, who
was giving a crowd of gaping listeners an
account of the strange things he had seen
during his peregrinations in the far West,
"the trees are so close together in Arkansas
that you may travel for days together without
finding them more than three feet apart ;
and then the game ! such vast numbers of
buffalo, and bears, and wild cats, but in all
the world I never saw such deer!"—"What
of the deer?" asked a sharp-eyed descen-
dant of Nimrod.—"Oh, the biggest, bouncing
bucks you ever saw," was the reply.
—"Why, my dear sir, the woods are per-
fectly alive with them, charging about with
great, branching horns full four feet apart."
—"Well, but if the trees are only three feet
apart, and the deer's horns four, I want
you to tell me how they get through?" said
Nimrod—"Oh, well, that's their look out."
said the traveler. "I have nothing to do
with that."{{< /news/text >}}

The Rice crop in Petchaburee.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}By advices from Petchaburee under date
of Aug. 24th we learn that the people were
then becoming very anxious again for the
safety of their rice crops—-that for the
week proceeding, there had fallen scarcely
a drop of rain, and that the rice fields were
getting quite dry, the water in the river
not having risen sufficiently to flow out in
to the fields.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our informant says that it is estimated
that about one fourth of the rice fields re-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}mained them unplanted; and that if the
three fourths do well, it will be a much better
result than that of last year when only one
fourth of the usual crop was obtained.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He adds that "the people have been
very diligent in feeding the priests and re-
hearsing their incantations for rain."{{< /news/text >}}

hopeful and cheering to Christian mer-
chants in Bangkok and elsewhere who are
