Peace.

{{< news/centre >}}
(SPECTATOR.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}God, then, governs, as well as reigns.
The two worst men in Europe, in the
political sense, frame a plot by which, af-
ter killing many thousands of human be-
ings and reducing millions to political
slavery, each is to obtain certain great
selfish advantages, the one for his family,
the other for his caste. The plot is suc-
cessful beyond their most sanguine an-
ticipations, and lo! two great nations
stand free from almost unendurable bonds,
while the plotters see their work accom-
plished and themselves not a whit nearer
to their end. If circumstantial evidence
in politics is ever to be trusted, this war
was arranged months ago by two men, the
Emperor Napoleon and Count von Bis-
mark, of whom one had crushed and
another was then crushing the liberties of
a nation. The one saw in a combined war
against an enemy who had given no pro-
vocation an opportunity of enlarging his
frontiers, and thereby seating his dynasty,
the other hoped to re-assert over Germany
the power of an effete and brutal aris-
tocratic caste. The Emperor, by feigned
indifference, courteous expressions to the
Austrian Ambassador, and courtly mes-
sages to the Austrian Emperor, first lulled
his victim into security, and then encour-
aged him to believe that he had only to
deal with his avowed enemies in the field.
The Minister first deprived his own coun-
try of freedom, then under the most ex-
travagant pretences induced it to believe
itself attacked, and then dragged its youth,
often by actual force, to a war which a
majority of them considered fratricidal.
Cynicism more complete than that dis-
played by Count von Bismark in the
Prussian Parliament was never displayed
on a political arena, nor universality more
gross than his speeches about the Austrian
plan of plunder, nor heartlessness more
utter than the last call to the fathers of
families to fill up the Landwehr. The
struggle began, and it seemed that justice,
as short-sighted human beings reckon
justice, had deserted the earth. The ag-
gressor was everywhere successful, the
cynicism had terminated useless talk, the
falsehoods had inspired the troops, the
cruelty had filled up the battalions to
repletion. As if in scorn of virtue, Pro-
vidence had given the oppressor a weapon
against which the virtues were powerless,
courage an empty boast, fidelity a snare,
patriotism a sentimental delusion. The
power of slaying without limit, a power as
of the evil genius in an Arabian tale, a
power as of the man whose finger pressed
on the magic globe raised earthquakes,
and wars, and Eros, had been given to
Count von Bismark, and it was unscrupu-
lously made use of. An ancient empire was
persons put to death, and a dozen ancient
societies overturned, with all the miseries
which accompany those violent operations,
and then—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Italy was united and free, North Ger-
many united and free, the Emperor of the
French was baffled, and Count von Bis-
mark stood in presence of a community
indefinitely stronger, more determined to
secure its liberty than that which he had
so vehemently defied. Those, we take it,
are the inevitable results of the great
cataclysm which the Prussian armies have
in ten days' campaigning brought about.
The first two propositions will seem to
most of our readers scarcely to need ex-
planation. The result of the battle of
Königgrätz has been to convince the Em-
peror of Austria that it was impossible to
resist the needle-gun, and he consequently
called in the Emperor Napoleon as the
natural arbiter in a European contest.
To enable him to act it was essential to
remove his private interest in the success
of one of the two combatants, and Venetia
was therefore, with a somewhat supercili-
ous contempt for Italy, ceded like Lom-
bardy into his hands. But he cannot keep
the province; he may ask a reward for
resigning it—-a subject on which we may
have something to say presently, but he
must, if only in obedience to his own
theory of nationalities, surrender it to
Italy. Instantly therefore, now, this next
week, Venetia becomes free. Two and a
half millions of people, who for sixty years
have been subjected to the most galling
slavery, who in that time have never lost
one jot of heart or hope, who have dared
all and endured all on the mere chance
that they might one day be once more
men, regain in an hour their freedom, and
commence amid their countrymen a free
and noble national life. It would be
worth all that Manin endured, all that is
killing Mazzini, to have stood for an hour
in Venice when that message reached the
Venetians, when but ten brief days after
the sickening defeat of Custozza the men
who followed Manin knew that their life's
aim was accomplished, that the Tedeschi
were about to retreat, that their beautiful
land was their own, that their sons were
no more liable to be seized to serve the
enemy in a distant wilderness, that three
fourths of their incomes were no longer to
be stolen to swell an oppressor's revenue,
that they were free to live and die with
their kinsmen as Italians, that they need
no longer—-THEY to whom music is as
speech—-shut their ears to delicious strains,
lest the foe should believe that their hate
could for one second be less deep. Never
perhaps in the history of mankind was the
sum of human misery so diminished in one
day by human act as in this cession of
Venetia. It is not only in Venice that
the relief will be felt, though there the
change is as that which falls upon the vic-
tim when his torture has given place to
sudden ease, but in all Italy. The danger
of dismemberment has ceased, and the
necessity for unbearable expenditure. She
is free and complete, for the first time in
a thousand years able to live, and move,
and be according to the powers, and the
instincts, and the wishes inherent in her
own life. If the war had done only this,
this one transaction which occupies five
lines of a telegraphic bulletin, the lives it
has cost, say as many as Ipswich or Rich-
mond and Kew contain, would have been
worthily sacrificed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But this is but the beginning. It is the
fate of Count von Bismark, part of that
irony of Providence which from the day
he accepted power has so visibly attended
him, that he cannot take a step towards
absolutism without crushing absolutisms
worse, because pettier, than his own. He
had not had his will four days in Germany,
before every despot in North Germany
save one had ceased to wield his despotic
power, and twenty-eight millions of men,
who for fifty years had sighed, and plotted,
and fought for unity, and gone sick with
hope deferred, were united under circum-
stances which forbid any forcible dismem-
berment. As we have explained elsewhere,
there exists no power save the King of
Prussia which can now divide North Ger-
many, and his interest is not in its division.
The nation is made, whether Napoleon
approve or the Czar be recalcitrant, wheth-
er the petty Kings become privileged
nobles, or die out like our own Stuarts,
whom most of them so closely resemble,
in unrespected exile. The "King" of
Hanover will point cannon on his citizens
no more, or the "King" of Saxony im-
prison them, or the Elector of Cassel take
their wives, or the Grand Duke of Mecklen-
burg order them the stick, or Nassau
demoralise them with his gaming tables,
or Oldenburg threaten them with Prussia,
or Waldeck seize them for an army with-
out a name, or a use, or a career. The
single despot has swept them away, and
German necks are released from the halter
that they may have free breath—-doubtless
to exalt Hohenzollerns, but still that halt-
er cannot be applied again. A nation of
twenty-eight millions of thoughtful and
energetic men, so learned that their know-
ledge is a proverb, yet so martial that they
at this moment give the law to Europe, so
democratic that English bourgeoisie
pronounce them vulgar, yet so reveren-
tial that English writers incline to call
them slavish, commence, because Count
von Bismark cannot bear freedom, a free
national life. We say free, for in his sense
it will be free. These new subjects are as
Liberal as Prussians, and they were not
bred up from teething time to reverence
Hohenzollerns, nor is it among them that
squireens are esteemed a separate and a
holy caste. If it was difficult to keep
down the love for constitutionalism among
Prussians, when their King was wild to
secure his army, and the Sovereign had a
Russian wife, what will it be when all that
is liberal in Hanover and Saxony, and the
Hesse, and the Elbe Duchies, and Nassau,
and the Free Cities, and Thuringia, is ad-
ded to the opposition, while all that is
conservative is disaffected, when liberals
are as anxious as the King that the army
should be kept up, and when the “influen-
ces” round that King are English instead
of Russian? The Germans have won their
unity in spite of thirty Kings, they will
win their freedom in spite of one King’s
Minister, though he has eaten the thirty
Kings up. The plotter will be defeated by
the magnitude of his plot and its complete
success.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So we believe will his ally. Napoleon
looked to a partial victory, to be followed
by complete exhaustion; but the victory
has been complete and there has been no
exhaustion at all. The forces of Prussia
are unbroken, the loss being merely one of
men, whom the single levy in the Elbe
Duchies will replace, and she is under no
necessity to yield an acre or a man except
at her own discretion. Consequently, if
we understand the motives that govern
Kings, she will not yield one acre more or
man more than it is convenient to surren-
der. What is convenient? Saarbuck?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Well, we are tired of hearing that “strat-
egical point” elevated to such preposterous
importance. Austria had all the strat-
egical points, and within ten days had also
the option of submission or dissolution.
The Palatinate? Well, the world will not
be greatly hurt or France greatly benefited
by the addition of a few Bavarians to an
empire of five-and thirty millions. Luxem-
burg? Luxemburg will not seat the Bon-
aparte dynasty, nor will ought that the
Emperor can squeeze from Italy great as
the loss to Italy may be. Though Venice
is worth Sardinia, it was the Rhine to
which the Emperor looked, the possession
of the Rhine which would, as De Toc-
querville said, have disarmed every French
enemy, and enabled him free of dynastic
opposition to “crown the edifice in safety.”
And the Rhine he will not have, for it is
not within even Count von Bismark’s
power to give it; and as to taking it, one
has breech-loaders to prepare before that.
There is Belgium, to be sure, but there is
also England, and Prussia cannot heartily
wish that Belgium should be French, and
Austria cannot love the friend who en-
franchised Italy, and in short the Emperor,
like Count von Bismark, has achieved
results which benefit all mankind, save
only those for whose benefit he intended
to strive. It is very ridiculous no doubt
to believe that God reigns; but with Italy
free, and Germany united, and the Junkers
weakened, and Napoleon wild with baffled
longing for prey, and all the work of ten
days and two conspirators, who meant any
other results than these, it is as at least
hard to believe that we are the sport of the
senseless Fate which it pleases English
materialists to call the “current of events.”{{< /news/text >}}

THE ARMISTICE.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}For the moment the interest of the
war has departed from the field of battle,
and entered the field of diplomacy. On
the morning of the 21st July the Paris
`Moniteur' announced that "Austria
had accepted the proposal of Prussia to
abstain from any act of hostility during
the five days in which the court of Vien-
na will have to notify its acceptance on
the subject of the preliminaries of peace."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The preliminaries proposed by Prussia
and approved by France are stated to be
as follows:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Austria to recognise the dissolution of
the former German Bund and the orga-
nisation of a new Confederation from
which she would be excluded.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The north of Germany to form a uni-
on under the military and diplomatic
direction of Prussia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The optional formation of a union of
South Germany as an independent inter-
national body.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}National bonds between these two
Unions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The annexation of the Elbe Duchies
to Prussia, with the exception of the
Danish portion of Schleswig.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Part payment by Austria of the Prus-
sian war expenses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The maintenance of the integrity of
Austria, with the exception of Venetia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These conditions have been submitted
by France to Austria, who has already
agreed to the first point, excluding her
from the Germanic Confederation to be
re-organised by Prussia. Apart from the
demands submitted to Austria, Prussia
intends to annex territory containing a-
bout 3,000,000 of inhabitants. The
Vienna correspondent of the `Times'
states that the Duchy of Silesia is the
territory which Prussia demands from
Austria as a part of the indemnification
which she is to receive for the heavy los-
ses she has incurred in men and money
during the war.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}According to the `Moniteur' of July
24, the Italian government has consented
to the armistice. That journal states:—-
Austria has accepted the preliminaries
of peace already agreed to by Prussia.
The plenipotentiaries of those two Pow-
ers are at the Prussian headquarters for
the purpose of negotiating an armistice.
The Italian government has just agreed
to the suspension of hostilities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The `Patrie' of the evening of the
24th says:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is stated that the terms of the ar-
mistice as regards Italy stipulate for the
occupation of Verona by the Italian
troops. It is not yet decided where the
conference for the treaty of peace will
take place, but a small neutral town in
Germany will probably be selected. It
is believed that M. Benedetti will re-
present France.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The `Italie' of Florence, of July 23,
observes:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We can state on good authority that
Prussia has not called upon Italy to sign
an armistice. The Prussian Minister in
this country is only charged to negotiate
with Italy the bases of the proposed sus-
pension of hostilities. No armistice can
be concluded unless agreed to by both
the allied Powers.{{< /news/text >}}

Latest.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The armistice of last Sunday July 22,
did not come apparently one day too
soon to save Austria from a final catas-
trophe. On that same day two Prussian
divisions, according to the telegrams
given in a previous column, defeated an
Austrian force of 35,000 men before
Presburg. The conquerors had advanced
to a distance of less than two miles from
the city, which could hardly have failed
to fall into their hands, when the an-
nouncement of the conclusion of a truce
compelled them to fall back on the line
assigned to them by the terms of the
agreement for a suspension of hostilities
at Stampfen. In the south the Medici
division of the Italian army, which, com-
ing up from Bassano and Belluno, had
gained the entrance of the Valsugana at
Primolano, forced its way through the
defiles of that valley as far as Borgo and
Levico, storming the Austrian positions
by splendid fighting, and invading the
Austrian Tyrol to within about 12 miles
of Trent, with heavy losses to the Aus-
trians in killed, wounded, and prisoners.
Yet one day more of such a contest, and
the Italians would have found themselves e
in full possession of the Southern Tyrol,
and the Prussians, masters of the passes
of the Danube at Presburg and Krems,
would have threatened Vienna on the
east and west, and on both sides of the
great river. The combatants are, how-
ever, now resting in their respective po-
sitions, and there are well-grounded
hopes that the truce may be prolonged
into an armistice, and this again ripen
into a definitive peace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From this suspension of hostilities,
however, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, and the
other south-western German States are
excluded. The efforts of the Prime
Minister of the Court of Munich, M.
von der Pforiten, to arrest by negotia-
tion the tide of Prussian invasion, have
been unavailing; nor can the Swabian
and Franconian districts to any extent
rely for protection on the 120,000 or
130,000 Federal troops which were said
to be armed for the defence of the line of
the Main. With their main Austrian foe
for the moment off their hands, the Prus-
sians will be sure to sweep forward to
the south till the Bavarian cities of Bam-
berg and Wurtzburg, Nuremberg and
Augsburg, and even the capitals of Stutt-
gart and Munich open their gates to
them. Political success everywhere fol-
lows upon military conquest. Already
Nassau, only yesterday occupied by a
Prussian army, is to-day clamouring for
Prussian annexation, and symptoms of
strong Prussian sympathies are every-
where exhibited to those very people of
Wurtemberg and Baden the governments
of which are still in arms against the
Prussian invader.{{< /news/text >}}

John Bright on Educaotion.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}John Bright lately delivered an address
before a Sunday-school conference in
Rochdale, in which he urged the im-
portance of universal education, citing
the example of New England in support
of his views:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Mr. Ellice, the very eminent member
of the House of commons for Coventry,
traveled in America, as he had done two
or three times before, very near the close
of his life, some six or seven years ago.
He visited Canada and the United States;
and, in a conversation which I had with
him after his return, he said that in those
New England States there was the most
perfect government in the world, there
was the most equal condition, and most
universal comfort amongst the people;
and he said that the whole population,
he believed, were more instructed, more
moral, and more truly happy than any
other equal population had been in any
country or in any age of the world.
[Cheers.] The whole of this is to be
traced, not to the soil, not to the climate;
but it is to be traced, I believe, to the
extraordinary care which the population,
from the days of the Pilgrim Fathers
until now, have taken with every child,
boy and girl, that they should be thor-
oughly instructed, at least in the common
branches of learning. [Hear, hear.] The
census shows that speaking generally,
there is scarcely to be found one person,
one native American certainly, and you
could not find one out of many hundreds
in the New England States, who cannot
read and write. [Hear, hear.] Now the
influence of those states is enormous.
Though only small states, containing not
more than one-tenth of the whole pop-
ulation of the American Union, yet the
influence of their opinions is felt to the
remotest corners of that vast territory.
[Hear, hear.] In New England they

They have tried it for two hundred years.
Its success is beyond all contest—it is
absolutely complete. [Hear, hear.]
There is nothing like it that has been
equally successful in the world. And
what our Puritan ancestors have done

as theirs) in the States, if the people of

their true interests, they might compel to
be done in the country in which we live.

The Siamese Government.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We would call the especial atten-
tion of our readers to the translation
of the government document publish-
ed in the present issue, because it
illustrates in a strange way and with
peculiar clearness the Siamese charac-
ter, but more especially the Siamese
government. It grieves us to think
that a man so high in power, as the wri-
ter of that paper manifestly is, should
be provoked to write so disparaging-
ly as therein indicated, of the services
we have endeavored most diligently
honestly, and faithfully to render the
government and the people of the
kingdom. The writer seems to make
no allowance for unavoidable mistakes
in verbal or written reports which
are furnished for our Siamese paper;
and because a few of the cases of evil
doing which we have published from
time to time, seem not to be well
substantiated, he assails us with the
sweeping condemnation of being chief-
ly engaged in publishing falsehoods and
of being "crazy in murmuring out
our continual complainings" The
truth is the writer himself is strangely
inconsistent with himself, for in a
multitude of instances he has sent us
his special thanks for the good we
had done in publishing evil doers At
one time he went so far as to send us
ocular demonstration by stolen goods
that had been taken from robbers
whom we had published, that our re-
port was true—that the govern-
ment was awake to its duty, and was
glad of the assistance we were render-
ing it by our semi-monthly. And we
have the best of testimony from all
quarters that our reports are very ge-
nerally but too true, and that the
country as well as the capital is be-
ing greatly benefitted by the many
eyes we have out inspecting the pub-
lic morals. We feel free to con-
fess that the native writers for our
paper sometimes make mistakes, and
perhaps sometimes designedly for the
purpose of wreaking vengeance upon
their enemies And we are feeling
more and more the necessity of hav-
ing our reports of evil well substantia-
ted before we allow them to appear
in our paper. We have to-day been
startled with the thought, that per-
haps a native article in one of our
late issues in justification of a certain
Cotton monopolist has falsely as-
sumed the name of the farmer for
the purpose of bringing upon him the
vengeance of the government. The
paper was handed in in our absence.
But seeing the name of a man of our
acquaintance in bold relief at the be-
ginning of the article, we concluded
that our friend intended to make a
true statement, and one with which he
would dare to face the government
and all his accusers. But to our sur-
prise he came to-day apparently in a
great hurry to enquire by what author-
ity we had published him as the au-
thors of that article. We could only
reply that we simply published the
paper as the writer wrote it and
showed him the original He denied
in the strongest terms all knowledge
of it until he had, an hour before,
seen the article in a paper sent to
the Prime Minister. We have a man
in our employ who says that the man
who brought the paper for publish-
ing is a servant of his. It is a very
difficult case to decide We of course
give him the privilege of disclaiming
it. But it will lead us to the greatest
carefulness in the future that no one
shall play such a trick upon us No
native communication shall hence-
forth be published in our Siamese pa-
per without better authentication
than the mere written name of its
ostensible author, because our Siam-
ese correspondents very generally em-
ploy others to write their names.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are well aware that it must be
very trying to the temper and patience
of the Siamese government to have so
many revelations made of its weak-
ness and inefficiency as our Siamese
paper is continually bringing out, just
as a wise paternal governor of a fami-
ly is prone to become angry when any
fault is found with the conduct of his
children. But as a wise father in such
cases would resolutely resist a fretful
and angry spirit, and determine to
make some good improvement of the
trial, so it seems to us that a wise gov-
ernment will firmly suppress all temp-
tations to angry feelings towards the
reporters of evil doing within its juris-
diction.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}liction, and determine to make the
best possible improvement of the trial
for its future welfare. Most surely the
Siamese government is in fearful need
of a through reformation! And we
must frankly express our opinion
that unless such a reformation is quick-
ly effected, and the government be-
come strong in righteousness and equi-
ty, it will soon elapse from utter rot-
tenness. But we still entertain lively
hopes that such will not be its deplo-
rable end, and hence we labor accor-
ding to the best of our ability by our
paper thinking that we shall surely
in the end be found benefactors of the
government and the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It appears to us that the head
of the government is sometimes
greatly deceived by crafty politicians,
causing the sombre views he takes of
some of the articles we publish. That
one, for instance, referred to in the
government document touching the
man Chaam at Bangplusoi, may have
been greatly misrepresented to him,
and that man may be really far more
of a desperado than the trial of the
case appears to have found him to be.
Some powerful party may have step-
ped in and intercepted justice by
bribery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are fully persuaded that His
Majesty the King's mind much en-
lightened as it is, is sometimes greatly
befogged in regard to the exercise of
justice in his kingdom by a multitude
of crafty officials who delight in chi-
canery, are exceedingly shrewd in it,
and live by it. He now requires
even more than the wisdom of king
Solomon to guide him aright in the
midst of such courtiers and coun-
sellors.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Oh the custom and spirit of bri-
bery is the great curse of the land. It
is a cancer eating out the very vitals
of the body politic. It has rooted it-
self in every department and function
of the government. It is a terrible
malady: but we hope not utterly in-
curable.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A government document.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
A Translation from the Siamese Recorder
of the 9th inst.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}An answer to an article in the
Siamese "Bangkok Recorder," con-
cerning a fellow named Châäm at
Bangplasoi, reported as going about
doing violence to Chinese, Siamese cul-
tivators of the rice fields and others.
The charges preferred against him and
published in the paper are many.
Seeing this printed report it pleased
the King to dispatch one of his royal
servants to Bangplasoi to examine in-
to the affair, in conjunction with the
governor of that province. Search was
made in vain for the man Châäm.
And failing in this, his mother and a
younger sister were seized and kept in
custody, as pledges or security for the
delivery of Chââm for trial. There
was another party, who, being influen-
ced by a reward, caught the fellow
and handed him over to the court.
But there was no person found willing
to stand as witness against him except
one woman, who testified that he had
been guilty of rape in a single instance,
and that was all. Besides that testimony
there was no other witness against
him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now shall such a case as this be
condemned to imprisonment, or be
killed at once, according to the crimes
which the "Bangkok Recorder" has
published against him? Let it be
published in the "Recorder" giving
it extensive circulation, calling upon
all persons who have been in any way
injured by the violence of the fellow
Châäm, to produce their personal
evidence against him, so that the case
may be still further investigated. If
there be none to witness against him,
openly and boldly substantiating their
charges, but write only false charges,
hurling them secretly behind his back
in this way, the publishers of the
paper will go on murmuring in their
craziness continually.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is another matter published
in the newspaper, which is a counsel
to government to have a law made by
which women and men shall be oblig-
ed to sweep and wash the houses
which they occupy, keeping them
clean and pure from all filthiness.
Now this we will allow is good advice.
But in regard to what follows viz:—
that if the occupants of houses will
not follow such a law, let them be
fined a certain sum of money for
disobedience of the law, and let the
money obtained by such fines be put
into the royal treasury—-how shall
such a law be carried out.? Shall
the King himself go all about the city
searching for treason! Or all the
men who compose the Senabardee
(royal counsellors) do it? If only
special overseers be appointed to do it,
it would certainly began a great amount
of quarrelling between them and the
citizens. One would say that an
overseer had cast filth and corruption
about my dwelling for the purpose of
getting some charges against me and
then came and seized me, and con-
sequently I resisted him. Now when
disputes like this arise, who shall try
them? And should a report be made of
such quarrels to the editor of the news-
papers, he would publish it as report-
ed. Would not that create great
confusion? Whatever shall be done
in this matter let the subject be first
considered well throughout all its bear-
ings. It is not at all suitable that
such a matter be treated in an easy
careless manner.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The king of Cheangmai and
Prot. Missionaries.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As in the providence of Him who
is "over all God, blessed forever"
the city and Province of Cheangmai
are looming up before the public with
more than usual rapidity and interest,
we propose now to give an account
of an audience which a number of
Am. Protestant missionaries of Bang-
kok had with the chief ruler of that
State a few days since. We begin
with the purpose of going thorough-
ly into the description even at the
hazard of being pronounced prolix,
because we have in mind many read-
ers abroad whom we know to be
pleased with minute descriptions of
things in Siam, as they get a much
clearer idea of them by such mi-
nutes than they otherwise could do,
and their great desire is accurate in-
formation about this, to them as yet, a
strange land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The audience was sought for the
purpose of obtaining permission from
the Prince for, Rev. Messrs. McGil-
vary and Wilson with their families
to reside at Cheangmai and prosecute
their missionary work there with the
same freedom that they have done
here and at Petchaburee.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These brethren have had their
hearts much engaged in Cheangmai as
a field for missionary labor for several
years, but more particularly so ever
since they visited it in January 1864.
And hearing, of the arrival of the
king of Cheangmai on his triennial
visit to His Majesty the king of Siam,
they arranged to have Mr. Wilson left
in charge, and Mr. McGilvary hasten
over from Petchaburee to Bangkok
to have an interview with the Prince
on the subject of removing their fami-
lies to his capital and making a per-
manent abode there. Mr. McG. ar-
rived here on the 28th ult. His first
interview with the king of Cheangmai
was on the 29th, and had his hopes
much encouraged by it. The Prince
expressed a good deal of pleasure in
the idea of having the brethren be-
come residents in his capital, assured
him that there would be no difficulty
in obtaining comfortable dwellings for
the two families at once, until they
should have time to erect buildings of
their own, that good teak wood
houses could be built much more
cheaply there than here, and that the
timber would cost them only the
trouble of hauling the logs from the
forest down to the place of their abode
and sawing them. But, said he, will
His Majesty the king of Siam give
you permission to settle there? The
answer was in substance, that in keep-
ing with His Siamese Majesty's well
known enlarged and liberal views, he
probably would. The reply was mani-
festly quite gratifying to the Prince,
and when Mr. McG. pointed out to
him the course he would take for ob-
taining a written permission from the
Siamese government, it met with his
full approbation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}About the beginning of the present
month J. M. Hood Esq. U. S. Consul
at the request of the Presbyterian
mission in this city, addressed a letter
to His Majesty the king through His
E. Chow P'hya P'raklang, Minister for
Foreign affairs, requesting permission
for Rev. Messrs. McGilvary and Wil-
son together with their families to re-
move to Cheangmai with the view to
abide there and prosecute their mis-
sionary work. It was not until about
the 7th inst. that an answer was re-
turned through the P'raklang, the
substance of which was, that His Ma-
jesty the king had no objection to
granting the request, but that it would
be suitable and proper to submit the
question to the Prince of Cheangmai,
and abide by his decision, as he is
the ruler of that country, looking only
to the King of Siam as his Sazarain.
Consequently H. E. the P'raklang
appointed Saturday the 11th inst., at
10 o'clock A. M. for the missionaries
to meet at the residence of H. E.
Chow Phya P'oo't'hrap'ie, Prime
Minister for Northern Siam, and have
there a formal audience with the king
of Cheangmai, and confer together on
the subject.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Accordingly on the day appointed,
four of the missionaries of the Presbr.
Mission, accompanied by J. M. Hood
Esq. U. S. Consul, and a grand-father
missionary of another board, went to
the residence of the Prime Minister
as appointed. Having the Am. Con-
sul with them they were sure not to
be too late. They were conducted in-
to a plain yet neat audience hall, and
seated in European chairs around a
Japanese centre table. A grass carpet
without seam, of Siamese manufacture
very neatly covered the floor. Sundry
pictures, some European but mostly
Japanese and Chinese adorned the
walls. At the right hand end of the
hall was an immense arm chair, highly
gilded, elevated on legs four feet long
to serve the purposes of a Budd-
hist pulpit in which a Priest of
this persuasion occasionally sits on a
series of days for a kind of protredted
preaching services. Hence the hall is
as much a private chapel for H. Ex-
cellency's spiritual concerns as a court
room for his government affairs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having been seated a few minutes,
H. Excellency made his appearance,
coming in as it were from behind the
pulpit, with a common country cigar
in his mouth and, as Europeans would
say, entirely in his dishabils, having
nothing about his person but a plain
calico panoong covering his hips and
thighs. This could not be regar-led
as being an insult, because it is one of
the many strange customs of Old
Siam and officials of Christian nations
as well as missionaries have learned to
bear it patiently. This Minis-ter seems
to stand in a state somewhere midway
between young Siam and old Siam,
belonging decidedly neither to the
one nor the other, and hence can ap-
pear at such a meeting in his old bar-
barous semi-nudity without a blush
of shame. Such could not the Prime
minister of Southen Siam do, for he
is too European in his habits and
tastes, and too decidedly a leader of
Young Siam to practise such barba-
rity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having shaken hands smilingly
with each of the party H. E. in a re-
markably sonorous voice enquired
which of them wished to remove to
Cheangmai, and for what purpose.
The answer being given he said it
would be necessary to learn the mind
of the king of Cheangmai, as His
Majesty the king of Siam had left the
question for him to decide. Is he
not expected to meet us here! in-
quired one. He has not yet been
notified of the meeting, but a messen-
ger shall be sent immediately to him
requesting an audience, was the reply.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The party was much surprised at such
a revelation, as the letter from H. E.
the P'raklang stated expressly that
the Prince would be in readiness to
meet them precisely at that hour, and
that if such an arrangement were not
made it might be difficult to obtain
an audience with him as the Prince
was much of the time absent. The
Minister immediately called to him a
stately servant in full dress and gave
him a verbal message to the Prince
requesting at the same time that one
of the gentlemen wishing to go to
Cheangmai would accompany him.
The Consul's boat, dignified with the
Am. stars and stripes bore the mes-
senger. The writer was requested
to accompany the messenger, think-
ing, perhaps, that his age and old ac-
quaintanceship with the Prince would
impart more power of accomplishment
to the object. In less than ten min-
utes we were at the floating house in
which the Prince had taken up his
temporary lodgings with all his train
of state barges about it. But he was
not there, having gone an hour
or more before, to make a call on H.
Excellency Chow P'hya Kalahome
less than a mile distant. The mes-
senger feeling sure that it was his duty
to follow on until he found him, went
in the boat under American colours
for him. The Prince, receiving the
message, came immediately away
from the Prime Minister's into his
own boat, and proceeded on his way
back to his floating house. But see-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}an extraordinary theatrical per-
formance in front of temple Kanlaya
he thought he would just step up for
a moment and take some notes of the
play. He was so much interested in
it that he quite forgot the object for
which he was returning. Having
waited some twenty minutes or more
at the floating house, and seeing no
prospect of his coming, we requested
Mr. Cox the Prince's English secreta-
ry to go back and remind him that
we were anxiously waiting for him.
He did so, which broke the charm
that had bound the Prince, and
brought him in a few minutes to his
abode in front of temple Aroon. He
invited us up to the chief sala of the
temple instead of the floating house
or his royal barge; as in the former
his queen was lying yet in a very
week state, slowly recovering from
extreme prostration by dysentery, and
as in the latter there was too little
room to seat us all comfortably.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He had clean grass mats spread for
us to sit upon, and a large rush arm-
chair for the Consul to occupy. But
the latter having waited full an hour
beyond the time appointed by govern-
ment, and judging it best to be in
keeping with all his previous determi-
nations to show himself a punctual
man, and more especially to show the
Siamese government that he means
ever to insist upon punctuality in all
his dealings with it, had left a few
minutes before, and was beyond call.
The Prince seemed quite disappointed
by it. But he was determined to
make the best of it, and accordingly
took the chair himself. He first in-
quired for what purpose we had come
before him. The messenger of the
H. E. Chow Phya' P'oot'arap'ie then,
bowing before him briefly stated the
object of the meeting. An officer of
H. E. the P'rakklung was present to
hear all that should be said, so that a full
report of the meeting might, though
the minister of foreign affairs, be made
to His Majesty the king.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On learning the object of the meet-
ing, and that His Majesty the king of
Siam had left the decision of the
question to himself, he said distinctly
that he had no objection to the two
mission families going to reside at
Cheangmai and there prosecute their
missionary work—that he would ever
be glad to have them do so—and
that H. E. the Prime Minister of
Northern Siam was at liberty, so far
as he was concerned, to give the mis-
sionaries such a passport to Cheang-
mai as they requested and whenever
they might desire it. He added that
as all that country belongs to the king
of Siam it was not his prerogative to
sell any part or parcel of the land to
Europeans or Americans; but that he
would be happy to give the mission-
aries the use of ground or the rental
of what they might need in building
them, dwellings and other houses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This was quite satisfactory to all con-
cerned; and all the talking about the
question was done even in less time
than we have taken to write out the
few sentences we have concerning
what was said and done at the au-
dience. A written passport was not pre-
pared at the time because it was yet
3 or 4 months before the time it
would be needed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prince desired to know how he
might become personally acquainted
with the Am. Consul. We promised
to use our influence to secure it be-
fore he should depart homeward. In
a little pleasant festing he replied, let
the day and the hour be appointed,
and I will be punctual to it: but if the
Consul comes out of that time, tell
him that I shall have gone somewhere
else.{{< /news/text >}}

of the timber farm.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have one event of a local charac-
ter to record, which is to, us of peculiar
interest. It is the fact that both His
Majesty the king of Siam and the king
of Cheangmai have given their verbal
permission to Rev. Messrs. Ma Gilvary
and Wilson of the Presb. Mission in
this city, to remove their families to
Cheangmai, and settle there. It is un-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}derstood that they are to enjoy all the
freedom as Missionaries which they
have hitherto done in Bangkok and
Petchaburee with the single exception
of the right to purchase land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE NEWS OF THE REBELLION IN Bur-
mah is, we are informed, making the
king of Cheangmai quite anxious lest
the rebels shall invade his territory in
his absence, and produce great confu-
sion in his government. Many of his
most reliable princes and officials are
here with him, and the security of his
kingdom is hence quite weakened. He
is therefore very anxious to hasten
homeward. It must be a long jour-
ney for him even with the greatest
rapidity that can be given to it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is just now, as we learn, an
interesting discussion going on in the
supreme court of Siam concerning a
certain Laos or Shan Prince who fled
a few years since from Mongmai a La-
os province belonging to Burma, be-
ing attended by 5000 followers, and
took refuge in one of the towns under
the jurisdiction of the king of Cheang-
mai. His name is CROWFA KOLAN and
is now living 15 days travel north of
Cheangmai. His son K'OON LOOGANG,
accompanied the king of Cheangmai
down the river to pay His respects to
His Majesty the king of Siam and is
now here. It seems that the king of
Burma has been employing a variety of
means all of a friendly and suasive
character to induce the king of Cheang-
mai to deliver up CROWFA KOLAN to the
Burman government, but has not suc-
ceeded. His constant reply to the king
of Burma, it is said, has been that the
question must be submitted to His
Majesty the king of Siam his Lord pa-
ramount and Protector. And conse-
quently the refugee Prince has sent his
son to the court of the Prabats[?] seeking
for protection from the Burman king.
We hope and trust that His Majesty the
king will be made well acquainted with
the good usages of European nations
in all such cases of political refugees,
and determine to protect that Burman
Prince; for there seems to be no ques-
tion that he is strictly and only a po-
litical refugee. England, even, is jus-
tified in protecting the greatest Amer-
ican rebels that were engaged in the
late civil war whenever they get fair-
ly within her jurisdiction, because such
conduct is according to the internation-
al code of laws which Christian nations
have agreed to as being just, and hence
should be binding upon all nations
therein concerned. And if the usages of
heathen nations do not harmonize with
this, it is high time they should; and
the king of Siam will be sustained in
violating a custom that would lead
him to deliver up a political refugee.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The Second King of Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The deeds of the second king of
Siam, are all recorded on the tablet
of time, and death has placed the fi-
nal seal. No change or amendment
is now possible. It remains for man
to review his deeds, and award him
his place in the world's history.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His title before he became a king
was Chow FA Nor. With this name
he distinguished himself for his know-
ledge and love of the arts of the west-
ern world. He, and his elder royal
brother, Chow FA Yai, had been set
aside by the officials empowered to
establish the succession on the throne
of Siam, to give place to a still elder
brother, royal only on his father's side.
For security Cuow FA Yai entered the
priesthood and gave himself up to the
study of philosophy, literature, and re-
ligion—-while Cnow FA Nor remain-
ed at the palace on the west of the ri-
ver, noted as the place where the cele-
brated Phya Tax held his court
when Bangkok was first made the ca-
pital, he was noted for his love of
whatever was European, and gave
himself up to the study of the arts as
practised by the natives of the west.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His watchward was progress. He
purposed to know what gave to the
west their development, their success,
their power, and their influence. His
ear was open, and his mind awake to
all that commanded attention in the
arts. This led him, perhaps, into the
company of a class of men, that while
they excelled in practical knowledge
were not always of equally sterling
morals, to give a good moral bias.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He studied navigation and the
art of ship building very early, even
before there were resident Protestant
missionaries in Siam. Captain Coffin,
who took away those twins that have
been the wonder of the world, was
one of his first teachers. The fact
that he made progress, under the
tedious method alone open to him,
shows that he was a man of great
energy. He then knew only a few
words of English, and there was then
no foreign resident, with whom he
communicated, who understood Siam-
ese. Afterwards Dr. Jones taught
him to read English and gave him
some knowledge of arithmetic and
mathematical astronomy. Eventually
he spoke English well. No other
Siamese, perhaps, excelled him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He did not first direct his architec-
tural skill to ship building. His first
essays at practical mechanism were
made at repairing watches. The first
vessel, after a European model, made
in Siam, was built by no less a per-
sonage than the present Prime Minis-
ter. The first men in the kingdom,
like Peter the great, have put their
shoulders to the wheel of progress, with
a will, and Siam has made great
strides in mechanism as a consequence.
The name of the Second King, the
Prime Minister and others of kin-
dred spirit will be known to posterity
as the benefactors of their nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Second King, while yet only a
prince, built several sailing vessels
from European models. After Mr.
Chandler arrived in Siam, the prince
prosecuted his mechanical efforts un-
der comparatively favorable auspices,
and made proportionate advancement.
He fitted up the first Steam Engine
in Siam. It was placed in a small
boat, and plied up and down the Me-
nam to the no little wonder of the un-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}initiated. The prince also had the
honor of introducing the first turning
lathe and setting up the machine shop.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the Siamese had war with
Cochin-China, during the reign of
PRA NANG KLAU, CHOW PA NOI was
made head of the Siamese Navy and
sent by sea, to aid in the war. This
brought out his military character.
Ever after, he showed pride in the
military department. None left so
fine an arsenal. None surpassed him,
in the drill maintained among the sol-
diery. The naval adventure also,
gave him an opportunity to perfect
his knowledge of navigation. He de-
lighted in practical astronomy, in all
its bearing upon this department. The
king put him at the head of the ar-
tillery of the nation. And however
meager, the whole military might be,
compared with the stupendous arrange-
ments for defense, in the western
world, compared with what had been
in Siam and what was, he was pro-
eminent.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His taste for order and neatness and
system were marked and unequalled.
He was willing to give himself trouble
to compass his fixed plans. He was
always thinking and planing and
devising and perfecting, completeness
marked his efforts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He was affable and gentlemanly in
all his intercourse with foreigners, and
if he did not generously reward ser-
vices, that were invaluable to him, it
should be put to the credit of being
obliged to accomplish great ends with
small means, rather than any natural
penuriousness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His palace was the admiration of
all who visited it. It was built after
a European model, furnished after
European manner, and with European
furniture. And his receptions were
above invidious criticism. All was order
and dispatch, with a degree of good
taste that was quite wonderful, in a man,
who had never been beyond his own
little kingdom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
CHAPTER II.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}When PRA NANG KLAU, the king
of the last reign, left the throne va-
cant, the kingdom seemed in jeopardy,
because the reigning king had sons,
who might claim the throne, and the
royal brothers, who had before been
set aside, still be left to move in quiet
life or fight for the throne. But two
powerful noblemen, and a few staunch
supporters, gave the priest prince,
CHOW FA YAI, the reigns of govern-
ment, and made CHOW FA NOI second
king, and through the support of these
powerful men all moved on harmo-
niously.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The change for CHOW FA NOI was
to a position of less notoriety, though
he bare the title of king. He was a
king in form without the power. He
had his army, his navy, his court, his
officials and all the forms of royalty,
but the first king had all the executive
power. And more, the Second King
needed to be exceedingly circumspect,
lest he might, in some way excite
envy, jealousy, or suspicion, and so
loose his place or even his head. This
fact made him act under restraint.
The position was not favorable to
the full development, or the full exer-
tion of his native and acquired abili-
ties, yet he showed his sagacity not
the less, by avoiding every act that
might seem to covet for himself chief
honor in the passing events of the
kingdom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He was more strictly a private gen-
tleman than while he was prince, and
gave himself to those departments
that could not awaken suspicion. He
loved to conduct all his correspondence
in such a way as to give him respect
abroad, and unlike his royal brother,
never could himself write so hand-
somely or compose so elegantly, that
he could not better meet the demands
of his cultivated taste, by one who
received an accomplished western
education. He was not willing to dis-
pense with a secretary even in his
simplest correspondence. He had the
habit of composition though he
wrote with quite superior penmanship.
His ideas were much beyond his own
power to execute, and none knew bet-
ter then himself how to call in foreign
aid. To secure a handsome ceremonial
note, he would dispatch a royal barge of
some twenty men, to call in the aid
of a foreign and educated friend. It
was something to occupy his thought
and please his taste.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He found much amusement and
employment in building some beauti-
ful pleasure boats and steamers and
gun-boats. He was always receiving
from abroad all the improvements in
fire arms, and found occupation in
writing orders and making suitable
acknowledgments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But his life of restraint was not fa-
vorable to his health. He grew hypo-
chondriacal. His low spirits made his
health worse. From month to month
he grew still more ill till it was whis-
pered that he could not recover. The
announcement produced general regret.
And with none more than the king.
He was a firm pillar of the state. The
king knew what he should loose in his
brother. He loved and respected him
and was in deep sorrow at the thought
of loosing him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I was in the ante-room in one of
the last visits the king made his dy-
ing brother. At that time the clos-
ing event was hourly expected. The
king came with no blast of bugle, with
no messengers preparing the way. His
arrival was announced in whispers.
He stole quietly into the ante-room,
waiting near the door of the sick room,
till he might be admitted to his bro-
thers side, and his train, composed of
his own daughters, sisters, nieces and
some of the next prominent ladies of
his court crouched around the ante-
room in solemn silence. We watched
breathlessly as he passed into the sick
room. He remained but a little time,
and when he returned seemed over-
whelmed with grief. He bowed low
as he crouched at the door and we saw
at a look that all hope was gone. The
whole company bowed with him and
wept. There was no lamentation, no
sound even, it was deep silent grief.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Yet the king in his sorrow did not
forget his country. That very day
was a glad day connected with some
hair cutting ceremony, which pro-
claimed to the people, that his royal
son was passing from the ranks of
childhood and might be a centre to
cluster the hopes of the nation. The
old props were being removed true,
but a royal heir was coming into their
ranks. Long live Crow Fa [?] Cur-La
Lox Kons. On him the eyes of the
council, that establishes the line of
kings for Siam will be constantly
turned. He should be trained to be
king. Though he might, like his royal
father, for a time give place to another,
his superior in age and wisdom. He is
right royal and the people will love
to honor him. May he live to ascend
the throne of his fathers, sustained by
men as true and loyal as have sustained
him, who now sits upon the throne.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Second King did all honor to
the throne. Let all honor be paid his
memory and to his children who live
to imitate his virtues. He has a
GEORGE WASHINGTON among his
sons, winning the hearts of his coun-
trymen, as did he whose name he
bears, by his kind and thoughtful de-
meanor. The sons of the Second King
as well as those of the first, ought to
have knowledge—science—the disci-
pline of the schools. They should have
teachers, and the present king could
do his country no greater good, and
give his royal brother no better token
of affection than by educating his large
family of children.{{< /news/text >}}

Rebellion in Upper Burmah.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Under the heading of the Startling
News from the Burmese Capital, we
published in an Extra on Wednesday last.
"That the intelligence from Mandalay is
to the effect that on the 2nd instant
(August) two sons of the King of Burmah
murdered their Uncle the Ein Shee Meng.
After that by zheir orders two of their
half brothers, three of the Woongyees
and other leading men were murdered."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Thongzay Prince, who fromerly
came to Rangoon, has escaped from the
city. There appears every probability
that no more bloodshed will take place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All Europeans are safe and unmolested.
No difficulty as respects intercourse be-
tween the Burmese and British Govern-
ments is anticipated.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To intelligent Europeans, Burmese
politics always present a very entangled
web, around which the secrecy of Orien-
tal Courts adds greatly to the perplexity
of the subject. But we may perhaps
make this matter plain by stating that
the present King has a large number of
sons, between thirty and forty altogether.
Most of these boys are of tender age,
but a few of them are rapidly advancing
into manhood, or have already attained
to that period of life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Since the accession to the throne of
the present King in December 1852, his
brother by the same mother, called the
Ein Shee Meng, was regarded both by the
Court and the population as the Heir ap-
parent to the Throne. The meaning of
the Burmese title by which he was ad-
dressed, implied this heirship. But as
the King and the royal brother were both
rising in years, the former being fifty five
and the latter fifty two, the younger
branch thought it high time to act as all
their predecessors had done, to strike for
the throne. A Burman monarch never
dies in power. He is generally either
put down by some conspiracy, or placed
in confinement. King Tharrawaddee,
the father of the late and present Bur-
mese sovereign, was made a prisoner by
his eldest surviving son, who mounted
the throne and retained his father a cap-
tive during the remainder of his life.
Similarly the Paghan Meng, or the late
king was hurled from power by a rising
of the people at the capital, during the
last war with the British government. He
was considered a mere puppit in the
hands of a few persons and utterly unfit
to govern. The Men-doon Meng then
mounted the throne and has kept his half
brother the Paghan Meng a prisoner ever
since. The deposed king has no sons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}By the events which have taken place
at the Burmese capital within the last
few days, the throne of the present and
very popular king seems to be shaking.
A rebellion is always a precursor of a
revolution. The direct succession stood
up to a recent date as follows:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}1. Brother of the king—Ein Shee Meng,
who is reported to have been assassinated.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}2. Eldest son of the king, The Ma-
toon Mentha, age about 25 years; also
murdered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}3. Second son of the king, The Thong-
zay prince, age about 24 years fled from
the city.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}4. Third son of the king, The Men-
goon prince, about 23 years of age; fled
from the city.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}5. Fourth son of the king, The Mek-
kara prince age, 22 years in the city.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}6. Fifth son of the King, The Tagoo
Mentha, age about 21 years, supposed
to be in the city.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Up to the breaking out of the rebellion
these were the principal members of the
royal family of Burma. As will be ob-
served, the game for the throne lies be-
tween the Thongzay prince and the
Mengoon prince. All of these princes
are half brothers, being born of different
mothers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}According to Burmese custom, the
prince who aspires to the throne, escapes
as quietly and as quickly as he can away
from the royal city. In the country, he
and his followers raise the standard of
revolt. They rally all the banditti and
dacoits throughout the country, and lure
them on by promises of plunder. As the
game is still playing, it is impossible to
tell who will be the next King of Burmah.
That the good and friendly King will be
dethroned, there is no doubt. His life
will be spared, and the remainder of his
days will be spent as a captive. As it is
unusual to retain two deposed Kings at
one time in the royal city, the fate of the
Paghan King may be considered as deci-
ded. He will be quietly put out of the
way.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two of the three Woongyees, or Minis-
ters of State who have been murdered
are known, one was the Myadoung or as
he was commonly styled the Paibay
Woongyee, who was the Commander-in-
Chief of the city, of the royal troops, of
the arsenal and palace. The other
Woongyee was Loungshay, the King's
special and confidential friend and adviser
in all matters pertaining to the welfare of
the kingdom. The third Minister of State
is not known, at least his name has not
been mentioned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among others who have been assassi-
nated in the course of recent events, is
the celebrated Moung Oke, the ex Bur-
mese Governor of Rangoon, to whose
rapacity and ferocity toward Europeans,
the last war was attributable. He held
no office, but his brother is Master of the
Horse and governor of Moke-so-bo, the
district just north of the capital.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The British government can feel no
concern in these tragic proceedings. We
cannot interfere in a civil war among the
Burmese. If they refrain from doing us
any injury, we shall allow them to settle
their quarrels among themselves. If they
attack out Resident, or kill any European
we shall be down upon them in double
quick time for justice and redress.— RAN-
GOON TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

Odds & Ends.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—Scarcely anything in life is so sweet
as the repose of Sunday—-the soothing
suggestion of its devouter offices, its si-
lence, its calm, its immunities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-When Voltaire was told that a friend
of his was studying to become a physici-
an, he exclaimed. "Why will he be so
mad? He will have to thrust drugs of
which he knows but little, into a body of
which he knows less."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-"Ah, me," said a pious lady, "Our
minister was a powerful preacher; for
the short time he ministered the word of
God among us, he kicked three pulpits
to pieces and banged the in'ards out of
five Bibles."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-The habitual conviction of the pre-
sence of God is the sovereign remedy in
temptations; it supports, it consoles, it
calms us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—The best defence of lying that we
ever read, is the remark of Charles Lamb,
related by Leigh Hunt, that "truth was
precious and not to be wasted on every-
body."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—A woman being enjoined to try
the effect of kindness on her husband,
and being told that it would heap
coals of fire on his head, replied that
she had tried "boiling water, and it
didn't do a bit of good.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-Elder Knapp, speaking of long
prayers once said: "When Peter was
endeavoring to walk upon the water
to meet his Master, and was about
sinking, had his supplication been like
to our modern prayers, before he got
through he would have been fifty feet
under water.{{< /news/text >}}

Anecdotes of Dogs.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}MR. ADSHEAD, one of our Derbyshire
correspondents writes:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I live in the country, and have
often occasion to be from home for
weeks together. During my absence
my dog (a very valuable one of the
bull and terrier breed), displays an
amount of sagacity, which to me is
quite as interesting as it is singular.
During my stay at home he quietly
sleeps in the back kitchen, but on the
night of the day that I leave home,
he makes his way up-stairs to the bed-
room where my wife sleeps, when he
creeps under the bed, and from thence
he will neither be coaxed nor driven
until the morning, as much as to say,
"I know your natural protector is
gone, so here I will remain and do
the best I can to guard you." This
the dog does every night until my re-
turn, when he goes back to his old
quarters in the kitchen, and there re-
mains until I again take my departure.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He has not been taught to act thus
and I can only refer his conduct to
that sagacious apprehension of con-
sequences which has led many dogs
aforetime to place themselves in sit-
uations where they have become the
means of saving life, and defending
property."—-British Workman.{{< /news/text >}}
