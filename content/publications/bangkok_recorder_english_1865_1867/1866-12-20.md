America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A death-blow to the policy of Presi-
dent Johnson is considered to have been
dealt on the 9th of Oct., in the result of
the elections for four States determined
that day. The republicans carried the
Pennsylvania elections, though, by a re-
duced majority; Iowa, Ohio, and Indiana
have also voted the Republican ticket.
Riots occurred at Philadelphia between
the Radicals and Democrats during the
last canvas, and several persons were
wounded.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Even the President himself seems to
have relaxed somewhat of the earnestness
with which he defends "his policy" of instant
and unconditional Southern restoration,
and by many indirect ways he has indi-
cated that in his Message at the opening
of the Congressional Session in December
next he will recommend an amendment to
the Constitution embodying, though in
less objectionable form, the main features
of the Radical amendment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Pennsylvania elected 24 members, Ohio
19, Illinois 11. Other States vote during
the coming month, the result being, we
are told, certain to be the same. Thus the
President will meet a Congress in Decem-
ber in which less than a third of each
House will belong to his party.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thursday, the 29th of November, has
been proclaimed a day of thanksgiving by
President Johnson. The proclamation
states in its preamble that:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Almighty God, our Heavenly Father,
has been pleased to vouchsafe to us as a
people another year of that national life
which is an indispensable condition of
peace, security, and progress. That year,
moreover, has been crowned with many
peculiar blessings. The civil war that has
so recently been among us has not been
anywhere reopened. Foreign intervention
has ceased to excite alarm or apprehension.
Intrusive pestilence has been benignly
mitigated. Domestic tranquillity has im-
proved; sentiments of conciliation have
largely prevailed, and affections of loyalty
and patriotism have been widely renewed.
Our fields have yielded quite abundantly,
our mining industry has been richly re-
warded, and we have been allowed to ex-
tend our railroad system far into the in-
terior recesses of the country, while our
commerce has resumed its customary ac-
tivity in foreign seas. These great nation-
al blessings demand a national acknow-
ledgment.{{< /news/text >}}

Russia.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The insurgent Caucasian provinces have
been disarmed, and the inhabitants of the
three neighbouring provinces have like-
wise been prohibited from carrying arms.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Jews here are threatened with a
religious propagandism of a terrible kind.
An association has been formed, the ob-
ject of which is to force the Jewish popul-
ation out of a country where they have
been established for eight centuries, and
to compel them to emigrate to the Cauca-
sus or the banks of the Adour. The 'Wil-
na Journal' has said openly that the coun-
try must be cleansed of this leprosy, and
that the Jews must be either converted or
exterminated. General Kauffmann, the
governor of the province, has directed the
municipalities and the head of families to
subscribe to this journal; he has farther
ordered schoolmasters to read it to the
peasantry, in order to prepare their minds
for the work of extermination. The society
has amongst its members many public
functionaries, amongst others the inspec-
tor of primary education. The Jews are
anxious to lay their case before the gov-
ernment of St. Petersburg, which has in
many ways improved their position, and
which seems to be entirely ignorant of
this infamous mode of propagandism. But
unfortunately the state of siege prevents
them from doing so.{{< /news/text >}}

Coming Autumn.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Alas for the summer ! The grass is still
verdant on the hills and in the valleys; the
foliage of the trees is as dense as ever, and
as green; the flowers are abundant along
the margin of the river, and in the hedge-
rows, and deep among the woods; the days,
too, are as fervid as they were a month ago;
and yet in every breath of wind and in
every beam of sunshine there is an autum-
nal influence. I know not how to describe
it. Methinks there is a sort of coolness
amid all the heat, and a mildness in the
brightness of the sunshine. A breeze can
not stir, without thrilling me with the
breath of autumn, and I behold its pensive
glory in the far, golden gleams among the
long shadows of the trees. The flowers,
even the brightest of them,—the golden-
rod and the gorgeous cardinals,—the most
glorious flowers of the year,—have thus gen-
tle sadness amid their pomp. Pensive au-
tumn is expressed in the glow of every one
of them. I have felt this influence earlier
in some years than others. Sometimes au-
tumn may be perceived even in the [..]ly
days of July. There is no other feeling
like that caused by this faint, doubtful, yet
real perception, or rather prophecy, of the
year's decay, so deliciously sweet and sad
at the same time.—-HAWTHORNE.{{< /news/text >}}

A Beautiful Old Age.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}God sometime gives to man a guiltless
and holy second childhood, in which the
soul becomes childlike, not childish, and
the faculties, in full fruit and ripeness, are
mellow, without decay. This is that thought-
ful land of Beulah, where they who have
traveled manfully the Christian way, abide
awhile to show the world a perfect man-
hood. Life with its battles and its sorrows,
lies far beyond them; the soul has thrown
off its armor, and sits in an evening un-
dress of calm and holy leisure. Thrice bles-
sed is the family, the neighborhood that
numbers among it one of these not yet as-
cended saints! Gentle are they and toler-
ant, and apt to play with little children;
easy to be pleased with pleasure.{{< /news/text >}}

More Men Wanted.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The great want of this age is men. Men
who are not for sale. Men who are honest,
sound from centre to circumference, true
to the heart's core. Men who will condemn
wrong in friend or foe, in themselves as
well as in others. Men whose consciences
are steady as the needle to the pole. Men
who will stand for the right if the heavens
totter and the earth reels. Men who can
tell the truth and look the Devil right in
the eye. Men that neither brag nor run.
Men that neither swagger nor flinch. Men
who can have courage without whistling
for it, and joy without shouting to bring it.
Men in whom the current of everlasting
life runs deep and strong. Men
careful of God's honor and careless of men's
applause. Men who know their duty and
do it. Men who know their places and fill
it. Men who mind their own business. Men
who will not lie. Men who are not too lazy
to work, nor too proud to be poor. Men
who are willing to eat what they have earn-
ed, and wear that they have paid for. Men
whose feet are on the everlasting rock. Men
who are strong with divine strength, wise
with the wisdom that cometh from about,
and loving with the love of Christ. Men
of God.—TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

An Actor's Advice to a
Clergyman.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Celebrated Garrick, having been
requested by Dr. Stonehouse to favor him
with his opinion as to the manner in which
a sermon ought to be delivered, the Eng-
lish Roscius sent him the following judic-
ious answer:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}MY DEAR PUPIL.—You know how you
would feel and speak in a parlor concern-
ing a friend who was in imminent danger
of his life, and with what energetic pathos
of diction and countenance you would en-
force the observance of that which you real-
ly thought would be for his preservation.
You would not think of playing the orator,
or studying your emphasis, cadence, or ges-
ture: you would be yourself; and the in-
teresting nature of your subject, impres-
sing your heart, would furnish you with
the most natural tone of voice, the most
proper language, the most engaging fea-
ture, and the most suitable and graceful
gestures. What you would be in the par-
lor, be in the pulpit; and you will not fail
to please, to affect, and profit. Adieu, my
dear friend.{{< /news/text >}}

law order in society.{{< /news/text >}}

cognise the Eternal Lawgiver, as to honor
the earthly “powers that be;” to secure
the moral atmosphere in a community
which is the only support of law.{{< /news/text >}}

A Novel Mode of Sueing.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rev. Samuel Harris was one of the ear-
ly Baptist preachers of Virginia whose la-
bors were remarkably blessed. The pun-
gent truths he preached were so enforced
by the tender earnestness of his manner
that whole congregations were often mel-
ted to tears. The following good story is told
of his settling a difficulty with a cross-grain-
ed man:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A man owed him a sum of money of
which he actually stood in need to defray
the expenses of his family. He went to
the man and told him he would be very
glad if he would discharge the debt he owed
him. To which the man replied that he
would not pay him the money. Harries
said:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“I want the money to buy wheat for my
family. You have a good crop by you. I
had rather have wheat than money.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The man answered, “I have other uses
for my wheat.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“How, then,” said Mr. Harriss, “do you
intend to pay me!”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“I never intend to pay you until you sue
me,” said the debtor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Harries left him meditating. “Good
God,” said he to himself, “what must I do?
Must I leave preaching to attend a lawsuit?
Perhaps a thousand souls will perish in the
meantime for the want of hearing Jesus.
No, I will not. What will you do for your-
self? I will sue him at the court of Heav-
en.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having resolved what to do, he turned
aside into a wood and fell upon his knees,
and thus began his suit:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“O, blessed Jesus, thou, Eternal God,
knowest that I need the money that this
man owes me to supply the wants of my
family. Dear Jesus, shall I quit thy cause
and leave the souls of men to perish? or
wilt thou, in mercy, open some other way
of relief?”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In this prayer he found such tokens of
divine acceptance that, to use his own
words, Jesus said unto him, “Harriss, keep
on preaching, and I will become security
for the payment.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. H., having the debt thus secured,
thought it most proper to give the debtor a
discharge. Accordingly he, shortly after
passing by to a meeting, carried a receipt
in full to the man’s house, and gave it to
his servant, desiring him to give it to his
master.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On his return by the house after meeting,
the man hailed him at his gate and said:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Mr. H., what did you mean by the re-
ceipt you sent me this morning?”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. H. replied:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“I meant just what I wrote.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Well, but I have not paid you,” an-
swered the debtor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Harries said, “True; and I know, also,
you said you never would, unless the money
came at the end of an execution; but sir,
I sued you in the court of Heaven, and Je-
sus has agreed to pay me. I have there-
fore given you a discharge.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This operated so effectually on the man’s
concsience, that, in a few days, he prepared
and sent to Mr. H. wheat enough to dis-
charge the debt.-—PACIFIC.{{< /news/text >}}

The Wigglers
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Carpenter in his reminiscences
of Pres. Lincoln tells the following good
story:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Upon the appearance of what was
known as the `Wade and Davis man-
ifesto,' subsequent to his renomination,
an intimate friend and supporter, who
was very indignant that such a document
should have been put forth just before
the presidential election, took occasion
to animadvert very severely upon the
course that prompted it. `It is not
worth fretting about,' said the president;
`it reminds me of an old acquaintance,
who, having a son of a scientific turn,
bought him a microscope. The boy went
around experimenting with his glass up-
on everything that came in his way. One
day, at the dinner table, his father took
up a piece of cheese. `Don't eat that,
father,' said the boy; `it is full of wig-
glers.' `My son,' replied the old gentle-
man, taking, at the same time, a huge
bite, `let 'em wiggle; I can stand it if
they can.'{{< /news/text >}}

Nearness of Death
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}When we walk near powerful machi-
nery, we know that one simple mis-step,
and those mighty engines will tear us to
ribbons with their flying wheels, or grind
us to powder in their ponderous jaws.
So when we are thundering across the
land in a railcar, and there is nothing
but an inch of iron flange to hold us on
the track. So when we are in a ship, and
there is nothing but the thickness of a
plank between us and eternity. We
imagine, then, that we see how close we
are to the edge of the precipice.—But
we do not see it. Whether on the sea or
on the land, the partition that divides us
from eternity is something less than an
oak plank, or half an inch iron flange.
The machinery of life and death is with-
in us. The tissues that hold the beating
powers in their place are often not thick-
er than a sheet of paper, and if that thin
partition rupture, it would be the same
with us as if a cannon-ball struck us.
Death is inseparably bound up with life
in the very structure of our bodies.
Struggle as he would to widen the space,
no man can, at any time, go farther from
death than the thickness of a sheet o'
paper.{{< /news/text >}}

and grief, we should get on very badly
without them. Only think-—if there was
never anything anywhere to be seen but
grown up men and women, how we should
long for the sight of a little child. Every
infant comes into the world like a delega-
ted prophet, the harbinger and herald of
good tidings, whose office is to “turn the
hearts of the fathers to the children,”
and draw “the disobedient to the just.”
A child softens and purifies the heart,
warming and melting it by its gentle
presence; it enriches the soul by new
feelings, and awakens within it what is
favorable to virtue. It is a beam of
light, a fountain of love, a teacher whose
lessons few can resist.{{< /news/text >}}

Our Mistakes About
Each Other.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not one man in ten thousand sees
those with whom he associates as they
really are. If the prayer of Burns were
really granted, and we could all see our-
selves as others see us, our self-estimates
would, in all probability, be much more
erroneous than they are now. The truth
is, that we regard each other through a
variety of lenses, not one of which is
correct. Passion and prejudice, love and
hate, benevolence and envy, spectacle
our eyes and utterly prevent us from ob-
serving accurately. We habitually un-
dervalue each other, and in estimating
character the shrewdest of us only now
and then make due appraisal of the vir-
tues and defects of even our closest inti-
mates.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is not just or fair to look at charac-
ter from a stand point of one's own se-
lection. A man's profile may be unpre-
possessing and yet his full face agree-
able. We once saw a young man, whose
timidity was a standing joke with his
companions, leap into the river and save
a boy from drowning, while his comrades
stood panic stricken on the bank. The
merchant who gives curt answers in the
counting room, may be a tender hearted
husband and father, and kind helper of
the desolate and oppressed. On the other
hand, your good humored person, who is
all smiles and sunshine in public, may
carry something as hard as a nether mill-
stone in the place where his heart ought
to be. {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such anomalies are common. There
is this comfort, however, for those whose
misjudgment of their fellow mortals leans
to the kindly side—such mistakes go to
their credit in the great account. He
who thinks better of his neighbors than
they deserve, cannot be a bad man, for
the standard by which his judgment is
guided is the goodness of his own heart.
It is only the base who believe all men
base—or in other words, like themselves.
Few however, are all evil. Even Nero
did a good turn to somebody, for when
Rome was rejoicing over his death, some
loving hand covered his grave with
flowers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Public men are seldom or never fairly
judged—at least while living. However
pure, they cannot escape calumny. How-
ever corrupt, they are sure to find eulo-
gists. History may do them justice; but
they rarely get it while living, either
from friend or foe.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}CONDEMN no man for not thinking as
you think. Let every one enjoy the full
and free liberty of thinking for himself.
Let every one use his own judgment,
since every man must give an account of
himself to God. Abhor any approach,
in any kind and degree, to the spirit of
persecution. If you can not reason or
persuade a man into the truth, never at-
tempt to force him into it. If love will
not compel him, leave him to God, the
Judge of all.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}KIND words are looked upon like jew-
els on the breast, never to be forgotten,
and perhaps, to cheer by their memory a
long, sad life; while words of cruelty, or
carelessness, are like swords in the bo-
som, wounding, and leaving scars which
will be borne to the grave by their vic-
tim. Do you think there is any bruised
heart which bears the mark of such a
wound from you? If there is a living
one which you have wounded, hasten to
heal it; for life is short—to-morrow may
be too late.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}HUMAN doctrines cannot cure wounds
in conscience. The remedy is too weak
for the disease. Conscience, like the vul-
ture of Prometheus, will still lie gnawing.
Notwithstanding all that such doctrines
can do.{{< /news/text >}}

December 20th 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The recent out break.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The rumor we published in our
last issue concerning Monsieur Auba-
ret the French Consul we are sorry to
say appears on further inquiry to be
but too true. We learn from many
witnesses of the most reliable charac-
ter that on Friday the 14th inst. His
Majesty the king gave out word that
he would in the p. m. at such an hour
meet his court and people on the pa-
rade ground outside of the eastern
gate of the Royal palace and proceed
to a temple near by. M. Lamache who
has the command of the royal regiment
hearing of this, called for a special
drill of his men for the occasion. M.
Aubaret seems to have been informed
of the purposes of the king, and con-
sequently happened to be there in
good time to have an informal inter-
view with His Majesty. The royal
corps of two or three hundred soldiers
were there in their best uniform and
finely paraded. M. Aubaret was invi-
ted by their Captain to wait a little as
His Majesty would certainly be out in
a few minutes. And so it was. His
Majesty, it is said, was surprised to see
the French Consul there, and said to
him, why have you come? The latter
replied that he had no particular bu-
siness, and had only come on a plea-
sure stroll. But that after a few pre-
liminaries he, taking a paper out of
his pocket, and handing it to His Ma-
jesty, began to speak disparagingly of
H. E. the Prime Minister, saying in
substance, that the French and Siam-
ese nations could never hope to enjoy
any peace so long as H. E. was allow-
ed to hold the place he does, and that
he must be humbled or the most seri-
ous consequences would be the result.
Some say that M. Aubaret even had
the impudence to propose that he him-
self be allowed to nominate a succes-
sor of the Prime Minister.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We would not be understood to af-
firm that such were the exact words
reported to us of the affair, but simply
the spirit of them. Indeed we now
aim to give as mild a view of it as
possible consistent with faithfulness
as public recorders. Many persons
comprising princes, nobles, lords and
people have told us in substance not
only what we have above reported,
but also that His Majesty felt himself
highly insulted by that audacious dic-
tation from the French Consul, and
bade him depart from him - that the
latter, then extending his hand to the
king with the view to give him a par-
ting blessing, was refused; and then
turning to His Majesty's children,
wishing to shake hands with each,
met with the same rebuff, coupled
with cutting words of indignation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are moreover credibly inform-
ed that that interview created a great
panic, and that the king's attendants
fearing there might be a development
on the spot of something far more se-
rious, manifested it by many unmis-
takable signs which need not be nam-
ed. The French Consul it is said then
went off alone in the direction of the
palace of the late second king, holding
his hat in his hand, evidently in deep
thought, and presently turned about
and retraced his steps. But ere he
had come opposite the palace gate His
Majesty had passed within, and the
gate was shut, and all his attendants
had significantly dispersed excepting
the regiment and their commander.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now, strange to say, M. Aubaret
has, since that unquestionable pub-
lic out-break, been making most ex-
traordinary efforts to frighten the
Siamese government with the charge
of having authorized the publication
of that article on the subject in our
last issue. He has utterly refused to
take the government's denial of the
charge, and has demanded that an
official inquiry be made of us whether
the government did or did not furnish
the information or in some way auth-
orize its publication. We have conse-
quently been honored with an official
letter from the U. S. Consul asking
but one question and that on that one
point. Our reply was promptly and
truthfully in the negative and added
in substance that while we obtained
our information wholly from unofficial
sources, we could have but little doubt
that it was substantially correct.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This letter was received and answer-
ed on the 20th inst. What has since
taken place with regard to the matter
we know not.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In view of what M. Aubaret has
already done we should not be much
surprised to learn that he will take
this occasion to "move heaven and
earth" as it were to make it appear
that His Majesty has in this affair in-
sulted the Emperor of the French, and
that it is a substantial casus belli—-
that a French army must be ordered
forthwith to put H. E. the Prime Min-
ister out of the way and thus remove
every serious obstacle in the way of
French domination in Siam. Why
the demand he made in that interview
with the king appears to us tantamount
to that of requiring him to cut off the
right arm of the government-—to pluck
out its right eye and stop both its
ears; And how preposterous the
thought that such matters shall not be
published in this city without license
from the French consul.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The inquiry is of course in every
man's mouth-—Is it possible that the
Emperor of the French has in any
way emboldened his consul to take
the steps he has? And will he sustain
him in what he has now done? We
are not able as yet to bring our minds
to an affirmative view of these queries.
We fondly and confidently hope that
M. Aubaret will soon learn that the
Emperor and his ministers have quite
too much sense of propriety and justice
to allow him to proceed further in
such outrages.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A glide up the Broadway
of Bangkok.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As you glide up the noble Menam,
approaching the city, being yet a mile
below the stone pillar which is the
southern boundary of the suburbs,
you will see on your left hand a
whitish building four stories high, of
commanding appearance among hum-
bler godowns and dwellings. This is
the Am. Steam Rice Mill, the mother
of all the others in Bangkok. It is
now, however, loosing its right to the
distinctive name, inasmuch as but a
small part of it is owned by Ameri-
cans, and the larger part by natives.
It has every appearance of being a
stirring place. Several ships or ves-
sels of other rig are usually seen near
by waiting to be loaded with rice; and
a multitude of country boats, with
round covers of bamboo wattling, are
moored along the shore, waiting their
turns to discharge paddy in the mill.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A few rods ashore, on the adjoin-
ing lot you will observe two large,
two storied brick houses, plastered
externally as well as within, having
hip-roofs covered with red earthen
tiles, the one standing ten rods from
the river, the other twenty, looking
cheeringly by their spacious verandahs
and inviting you to call in. This is
the Bangkok station of Am. Presby-
terian Mission. On the upper and
outer corner near the bank of the
river stands a small brick chapel,
white by the external plastering, with
green window shutters, and an invit-
ing porch. A small belfry, and bell
give it quite a homelike appearance.
The mission premises have a very
rural aspect with the tall durian,
maprang, satawn, bamboo trees, etc.
on an acre or more of land but little
cultivated for a front, and a forest of
fruit trees in the rear. It is a fine
location for their mission school, which
has been in successful operation for a
period of six or eight years. This
place is a little more than four miles
below the kings palace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the opposite side of the river,
which is there more than one hund-
red yards wide and many fathoms
deep, you will observe a spacious
brick mansion of two stories, with a
hip-roof of earthen tiles, plastered
externally like all brick buildings in
this country, standing quite alone in
a forest of trees, most of them fruit-
bearing and of the richest and un-
withering foliage. It was built by J.
H. Chandler Esq. some six years since
and occupied by him till about nine
months since, when it was sold to R.
S. Scott & Co. It has been unoccu-
pied many months, and consequently
is now looking quite desolate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Looking up the river on the same
side about a quarter of a mile you
will see the Clyde Dock yard of Dan-
iel Maclean & Co. The buildings
are all of an humble order, of unpain-
ted wood, thatched with attap-palm
leaves and consequently the whole
establishment is now looking much
weather-beaten. It is a place usually
of much business in its line, and many
new vessels of small tonnage have
been launched from its front within
the last six years. Between it and the
Chandler-Mansion is a small Buddhist
Temple scarcely to be seen in the
Jungle of trees.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing eight or ten rods above the
Dockyard, you will come to another
Steam Rice Mill, having equally a
business appearance with the one be-
fore named. The principal building
is of four stories entirely enclosed and
covered with zinc sheets or sheet iron
painted white. It belongs to The
Bangkok Rice Mill Co. of which the
Borneo Company and A.M. Odman are
the resident partners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some twenty or thirty rods still
further up, on the same side you will
come to a Steam Saw Mill, erected
two or three years since by D. Maclean
Esq. and is owned, at the present time,
if we mistake not, by himself alone.
He has made great use of the mill in
connection with his Dock-yard, and
it contrasts splendidly with the native
sawmills where all the work is done
by hand. It is passing strange that
native capitalists, seeing its operations
do not become disgusted with their
hand-mills, and will still hold on most
tenaciously to pulling their saws
through immense teak logs "by the
sweat of their brows" which is crush-
ing to the spirit of even a spectator.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Adjoining this Saw mill on the
north side, is a Buddhist temple,
rather hidden from the river view by
trees of many varieties among which
are several tall spruce and fir trees. The
establishment evinces that it has had
much money expended on it, and is still
well cared for. The river bank in front
is neatly diked with two or more flights
of steps passing up into the temple
court. Next above this is another
temple of more humble appearance in
a jungle of trees and but poorly at-
tended to.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gliding up a few rods further you
will find yourself opposite the Protes-
tant cemetery on your right hand,
which is very suitably located in a re-
tired place, and sparsely studded with
tall fruit trees. Its front has, till lat-
terly, been quite neat and tidy, with
a broad flight of easy steps going up
into an unassuming sala. But now
the dike, having been broken down by
the river cutting away the bank, it
has, we are sorry to say, a shabby
look.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The shore on your left hand from the
Presbyterian Mission to some distance
above, is chiefly occupied by orchards
of cocoanut and betel trees, durian
and tamarind and many other kinds
of tall fruit trees, thickly set, without
order, interspersed with bananas etc.
Here and there you will see a
farm-house near the river, enclosed
with teak-wood, usually thatched with
attap leaves, but rarely covered with
earthen tiles. As they are never
painted, they always have a deeply
weather-beaten appearance. You will
see three or four small floating houses
far separated from each other, moored
a little distance from the river's bank.
These like pickets are sent out, as it
were, to feel the way for an unbroken
phalanx of them to come down erelong
and occupy that part of the suburbs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gliding up a quarter of a mile fur-
ther and you will come to another
Steam Rice Mill, belonging to Mes-
srs A. Markwald & Co. It figures
well as such, and is doing nearly if
not fully as much business as either
of its three predecessors.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Immediately adjoining this on the
next lot above is the new Steam Rice
Mill erected by R. S. Scott & Co. but
sold last week to Phya Buroot a Siam-
ese nobleman. It is a more tidy and
snug looking affair than either of the
others, and is thought to be indeed a
little improvement in its internal ar-
rangements. But as it has been only
recently finished, it does not as yet
command much business. How it will
be conducted by the natives we know
not; but think it not improbable that
it will develop much Siamese skill
and power, as this people are quick to
learn and occasionally good to work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing up some fifteen or twenty
rods further, you will be opposite the
establishment of Messrs. Pickenpack
Thies & Co. on your right hand. It
consists 1st of a roomy but very plain
wooden house, unpainted, and with at-
tap thatching near the river;—2nd A
spacious brick dwelling, now the Am-
erican Consulate, a little retired from
the bank, with a beautiful door yard
decked with flowering and never with-
ering shade trees, with a landing neat-
ly diked; and 3rd—A large brick go-
down covered with corrugated iron.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Adjoining these on the north is the
establishment of Borneo Company
"Limited" consisting mainly of large
brick godowns with a substantial Of-
fice of two stories attached to the front
and of the same, and a spacious wood-
en dwelling with a hip-roof thatched
with attap. Their place is also
thoroughly diked, presenting an even
bank, and has several flights of steps
passing up to a charming lawn in front
of the dwelling.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You are now just within the city
suburbs as the granite pillar forming
the southern boundary stands on the
upper corner of the lot of Messrs. Pic-
kenpack Thies & Co. Its distance
from the lower Rice Mills is just one
mile, and about half a mile below the
British Consulate, situated on the same
side of the river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the other side of the river oppo-
site to where you have arrived is a very
neat and unassuming Buddhist temple,
which as usual for nearly all temples,
is much hidden by shade trees in front
with a back ground of a forest fruit
trees in almost all the wildness of na-
ture. And all these like a vast majo-
rity of the trees of this exhuberant
valley, are ever densely attired with
the richest foliage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hope to conduct you up to the
Royal palace on another occasion, and
will now stop in front of the Protes-
tant Church on the east side of the ri-
ver, the next lot above the premises of
Borneo Company "Limited." And
this by the by is a very suitable place
for us to stop at, especially on the
Lord's day. Would that all European
and American christians, merely nomi-
nal as well as professing, were of the
same opinion. The church edifice looks
charmingly out on the river and seems
to say "come in hither." "Ho every
one that thirsteth come ye to the wa-
ters." The edifice is of the most solid
brick walls, with a porch supported by
five massive pillars of the same mate-
rial and the whole plastered within and
without with the whitest lime. The
roof is covered with the usual earthen
tiles of the country which always look
neatly. There is a pleasant front yard
to the church adorned with "never
withered flowers" of many kinds, fit
emblems of heavenly sweetness and
purity. The church will seat very
comfortably about two hundred adults
and by some extra arrangements dou-
ble that number. We will now close
by saying to our local readers, please
invite all your friends to "come and
see."{{< /news/text >}}

HISTORY, LITERATURE RELIGION &c.
CHAPTER III.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Water does a great deal for Shan-
land. There is the Gulf at its base,
washing along its coasts at both sides,
and the beautiful rivers intersected
with canals bring water in abundance
to almost every man's door. What
would the people do without these es-
sentials to good looks, good health
and general comfort!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In all my travels here, I have al-
most uniformly, been led to admire
the abundant facilities for cleanliness
and comfort, from the great water
privileges. There seems one excep-
tion, and I am sure it arises more from a
want of a little energy and effort than
anything else. I refer to Anghin and
other towns in this vicinity. Of all
Shanland I like the eastern coast the
best of all, if it had good advantages
for fresh water. The sea rolls before
it, and it has a fine sandy beach and
lays well to receive the sea breezes of
both monsoons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I do not see why there might not
be a good road from the Bangpakong
river, a “little far up” somewhere in
the vicinity of the first town, running
down the coast till obstructed by
towering mountains, and then a good
canal could be dug beside it, supply-
ing fresh water from the great river.
Thus the desideratum, would be se-
cured, and the coast become suscep-
table of a large population with better
facilities for business than any other
part of the country, and affording
most magnificent residencies for a
foreign community.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The mountains of Bangplasoi in
juxta position with Anghin would
quite vie with the celebrated San-
itarium of the East, Penang. Ship-
ping lays at a convenient distance, and
no obstructing bar would prove a
hindrance to ready ingress or egress
to the convenient shipping, and a bet-
ter harbor could not be found any-
where. The Gulf itself is quite safe,
the whole year round, at the present
anchorage. Shipping may there lay in
quiet security, and have no fear of ill.
And there is sea room adequate to ac-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}commodate shipping to its greatest
demands.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why need all produce go to Bang-
kok, to be received and discharged?
If the number of ports were increased
the country would awake to produc-
tion, that the demand might be met.
And if taxes were paid in the vicinity
of the production, and a portion ex-
pended to improve the country, and
increase its internal facilities for com-
merce and general trade, a new stimu-
lus would be created to nerve the
people to effort, and thus labor and
reward move on hand in hand.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Onward let the car of enterprise
take its course. Let each give the
wheel an impetus, and all a cheer, as
they see it move in the path of pro-
gress. He that produces, acts with
God, creating for his men. Let every
man and every child emulate in the
noble enterprise. Ask what you've
made when the day is done, and call
that day lost you've done no good to
live, and be a part of coming good,
you purpose still to do.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Were the policy of the country for
progress, to its greatest susceptibility,
we should soon see the country open
up everywhere. In our day perhaps
there might be ports at the mouths of
all the great rivers communicating
with the sea. The business mart for
the river where the capital is located
would be further down nearer the sea,
and the whole policy might be a la-
bor saving policy, the creating a great
amount with the least expense.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Bangkok is the capital, and as such
should be a sort of Athens, where the
literati clustered, where wisdom and
knowledge, in every department were
sought and disbursed in laws and
science and literature and religion.
We should expect governors and law-
yers and doctors and judges and
teachers of all departments, to get a
great stimulus from the capital. Here
would essentially be the place to make
books, issue newspapers, establish col-
leges, found seminaries and universi-
ties, and prepare teachers and preach-
ers to go to remote parts and estab-
lish new centres to induce like cul-
ture and impulse and progress.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The people of Siam and are awake
to some 'extent as to their physical
advantages. Let all strive to help de-
velop them, and thus there will be
investments for funds, that will be of
permanent benefit to the country.
Roads and canals cannot run away,
or be burned up, and if well located
they cannot fail to make property
very remunerative. The king might
take the American plan, give stock-
holders, every alternate lot; to pay for
making highways, and both king and
people be made rich by the measure.
And if the people were allowed to
expend taxes, in a fair proportion
where taxes were levied, where the
country needed improving and de-
veloping, the people would at once
awake to internal improvements and
think and execute for themselves with
great facility, what is now done by
the king, with a deal of trouble and
expense.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If the people were allowed to take
the work into their own hands, the
king only protecting from oppression
and giving encouragement to progress
in every department, that was for the
benefit and progress of the country,
the whole country would immediately
be a bee-hive, and every individual a
bee, busy in some department, that
was to tell in a needed future.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Show "for the day" would be
hooted from the list of things ap-
proved, and permanent real substantial
good alone be taken into account.
What does the health of the body
and the health of the soul require?
This would be the proposition to test
every enterprise, and as it contributed
more or less to this great good, so
would its value be rated.{{< /news/text >}}

FOR THE BANGKOK RECORDER.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}MR. EDITOR-—It is rumored that
you have been called upon officially
to render an account for an article in
your last issue over the signature
Com. Now Sir, His Majesty the
King of Siam is a public man and his
Prime Minister of no private reputa-
tion. And if a consul makes his ap-
proaches in a public assembly deman-
ding of the one a political decapita-
tion of the other, will it not be com-
municated? Why the wonder is that
your sheet was not filled with com-
munications from every consul and
every other official in the city. What!
His most esteemed Majesty, noted
for his liberal policy, now in treaty
with all the great western powers, be
ordered, or even requested, to degrade
his Prime Minister, a man famed the
world over for his love of progress in
all the improvements of high civiliza-
tion, the main pillar of His Majesty's
government, and not produce a sen-
sation! Was it strange that those
who witnessed their much esteemed
king and their universally beloved
princes and princesses withdrawing
from the scene in indignation, and
shutting the palace gates after them,
should tell the tale!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Remove the Prime Minister! Why

Ironclads and the New
Woolwich Gun.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Times)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}That the strongest ironclad afloat
might be sent to the bottom as easily as
a wooden frigate is now a fact about
which it is hardly possible to entertain a
doubt. A target with greater resisting
powers than the broadside of any iron-
cased frigate or the turret of any Moni-
tor has been completely smashed by a
particular kind of shot fired from a par-
ticular kind of gun, and that gun and
that shot are of British make and inven-
tion. It is of equal importance to ob-
serve that the gun which has proved so
irresistible is not a piece of any pro-
digious calibre or impracticable weight,
but only such a gun as could be carried
and worked in a ship's broadside.
Whereas, too, it is scarcely credible that
any ship could be sent to sea with thick-
er or more ponderous armour than was
represented in the target demolished, it
is very credible indeed that the calibre,
charge, and power of the gun might be
increased, so that the essential question
between ships and guns may be regarded
as settled. That is the conclusion forced
upon us by the results of the remarkable
experiments just reported from Shoebury-
ness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The target exposed to fire on this oc-
casion was built up of 18 inches of teak,
and this compact mass of woodwork was
covered in front with solid plates of rol-
led iron eight inches thick, and streng-
thened at the back by an inner skin of
iron three quarters of an inch thick. Al-
together, therefore, this imaginary ship's
broadside was about two feet three inches
in thickness—that is, about as thick as
the wall of an old Norman castle, while
the materials were hard teak and solid
iron, instead of ashlar and rubble. If
castles, in fact, had been built in such a
fashion, they would have remained up to
our own day as impregnable to artillery
as they originally were to bows and ar-
rows. Nevertheless, when a gun des-
cribed as the “nine-inch muzzle-loading
wrought-iron Woolwich rifle gun,” was
trained against this target, and fired with
a charge of 43lb. of powder and a 250lb.
shell of Major Palliser's chilled metal,
the effect was decisive. The projectile,
we are told, “went clean through every-
thing, plate, backing, and inner skin, and
lodged itself, after exploding in some
timber, about 20 feet behind the target.
“Anything more crushing,” it is added,
“than the shock of this missile it would
be difficult to conceive, for it struck full
upon one of the vertical parts of the
target, and tore its way through as if
only opposed by a timber screen.” A
repetition of the experiment did but con-
firm the results, and the main fact, there-
fore, is placed beyond reach of doubt.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One or two reservations should, it is
true, be put upon record. These effects
were produced under conditions excep-
tionally favourable to the gun, which
was fired at a comparatively short range,
and against an immovable target struck
at right angles. It is obvious that such
conditions could not always be anticipated
in an action between ships carefully
manœuvred, though an English captain
would probably ask for nothing more
than equality of speed to give him all
necessary opportunity for the practice of
his guns. Still it must be noticed that
when the target was inclined at an angle
to the line of fire the projectiles did fail
to penetrate it. They tore tremendous
holes in the plating, and one of them ac-
tually got in to a depth of 12½ inches,
but they never went quite through. We
should also observe that Mr. Chalmers,
the inventor of a very celebrated target,
claims to be able still to construct a block
of wood and iron which shall be impreg-
nable to shot, but practically the case
stands as we describe it. Now, as no
ironclad afloat carries solid armour of
eight inches in thickness; and as the
composite or laminated armour of the
American turrets, formed of single-inch
plates screwed one upon another, will
bear no comparison with solid metal, it
follows, as we have said, that the armour
of any fighting ship at present known
might be completely demolished by a
250, pounder gun. The deductions na-
turally flowing from the conclusion are
important in the extreme.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the first place, if we are to accept
these facts as permanently established,
we may dismiss the question of monster
cannon from our minds. A gun which
will sink any enemy is quite big enough,
and nothing would be gained by a big-
ger one. The hole made in the Shoebury
target by a nine-inch Palliser shell was
large enough to settle the fate of any
vessel afloat. If the Americans prefer
15-inch or 20-inch shot, they have a
right to their choice, but it is obvious
that this weight of metal and calibre of
ordnance represent so much superfluity,
if the required work can be performed
by a nine-inch gun with equal effect.
And this again relieves us of another dif-
ficulty. We shall be no longer under the
necessity of building turret ships. In so
far as a turret vessel represents any
other advantages of model, the device
may still be a serviceable one, but as
regards the peculiar capacity of the tur-
rets for carrying enormous guns, the re-
commendation will of course disappear
when enormous guns are no longer re-
quired. As far as we can now see, the
biggest guns wanted for sea service can
be carried easily in broadside, and con-
sequently a broadside vessel is just as
good as ever. We might almost say, af-
ter what has thus been proved, that the
value of an ironclad as a fighting vessel
has vanished. When ship's armour was
first introduced it rendered ships im-
pregnable, and hence its importance.
But now that the cannon of that day are
to be superseded by the Woolwich gun
of the present the armour confers no
such security, and so its importance is
lost. When we read that the sides of
the Warrior are simply as vulnerable as
so much basket work it seems impossible
to regard the Warrior as more of a man-
of-war than a stout old frigate. This, of
course, would be an extreme conclusion.
The Warrior's armour would protect her
up to a certain point, and insure her a
proportionate superiority, nor is it a
slight advantage for a ship to be invul-
nerable except under peculiar conditions
of attack. Still the broad fact remains
that an ironclad is as helpless as any
wooden corvette against a certain gun
which every British ship ought to carry.
Presuming ironclads and wooden ships
to be thus placed upon an equality of
hopelessness before modern artillery,
may we not reconsider our opinions a-
bout the worthlessness of our old wood-
en navy? That navy comprises vessels
by the score which, if wood is as good as
iron, are still the most magnificent ships
in the world, and is not wood as good as
iron if one material is just as strong, or
as weak, as the other? In this case our
old superiority as a maritime Power
would be suddenly restored.-—MAULMAIN

The Corea.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A strange piece of news has just
reached us. It appears that off Wusung
the H. I. M. steamer DUPLEIX full in
with part of the French squadron de-
tached to Corea, viz. the Primaguet
and three others, which reported that
the expedition had sustained a severe
repulse at the hands of the Coreans on
its attacking Saoui, forty men having
been killed and wounded on the side
of the French. One gunboat got ashore
in the river, owing to the tremendous
fall of the tide, which is stated at about
42 feet, she was for some time left 30
feet out of water on a flat rock! For-
tunately she was eventually got off.
The French Admiral in the Laplace,
and the remainder of the squadron con-
sisting of the Guerriere, Kenshan, and
others had gone to Yokohama.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Naturally enough a question may be
asked as to the real cause of the mur-
der of the whole crew of the unfortu-
nate schooner, Gen. Sherman and the
answer is that it was a simple bravado
of the Coreans, treating with defiance
a secret despatch from the Peking Gov-
ernment, with reference to their im-
prudence of action as regards Europeans
and warning them at the same time to
avoid getting into any difficulties with
him. This dispatch was received in the
Corea on 15th August. The Regent in-
stigated by his ministers, replied that it
was not the first instance that the Co-
reans had put Europeans to death, that
China was not to meddle in the matter,
and that what the Coreans had done be-
fore they would continue doing! The
text of both documents was widely circu-
lated throughout the Corea. We had
them ourselves, but we overlooked, in
the hurry of getting away, to keep them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After the disaster to the unfortunate
crew of the schooner, the Koreans vis-
ited two Chinese Junks, and searched
them thoroughly, expecting to meet
with some more Europeans secreted on
board, not finding them, however, and
under the pretence that the junks were
carrying on contraband trade, because
some shirtings, contraband articles,
were found on board, they put both
crews to death."{{< /news/text >}}

The French and the Corea.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It will be remembered that we re-
cently expressed our opinion that the
French were hardly aware of the na-
ture of the people whom they were
about to chastise and mentioned the
anxiety evinced by the Koreans to be-
come possessed of European scientific
apparatus. We now lean that the Co-
reans are reported to have been well
provided with arms of all kinds—-
rifled cannon, revolving carbines and
as some assert, needle guns! Nothing
could have been more unpropitious
for the prestige of European arms in
China than the defeat of a French
squadron by a people whom the Chin-
ese look upon as their inferiors and
who pay annual tribute to China. By
the way, how is it that nothing has
been heard of the United States offi-
cials in connexion with the burning of
the General Sherman? If they re-
frain from action it will be as disgrace-
ful as the apparent apathy of our own
representative, who appears to have as
yet taken no steps in reference to the
decapitation of the unfortunate Mr.
Thomas and his companion by the
Koreans. Are the French to have the
honor and glory of a repulse all to
themselves?{{< /news/text >}}

Ruined Temples of Cambodia
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the Geographical Section of the
British Association, Mr. Thomson read
a paper describing a visit which he made
in January last to the ruined temples of
Cambodia, in or adjoining Siam. The
once extensive and powerful kingdom of
Cambodia, or Khamain, is situate in the
tropics between Siam and Cochin China,
from its southern extremity in the Gulf
of Siam extends upwards of between
fourteen and fifteen degrees of North
latitude, and from one hundred and
three to one hundred and six and one
hundred and seven degrees East long-
itude. The author left Bangkok on the
27th of January last, the course of the
journey lying along the Klong Koot Mia
creek. On the 29th the party reached
Pachin, which is situate about sixty miles
north-east of Bangkok, being the first
place of importance on the route. At
length the party reached Cambodia, the
ruins of which are described as follows:-
The first trace of the ruins of Cambodia
are situated on the left bank of the river,
and consist of a rectangular mound, in
the centre of which are to be found
among the sculptured remains the frag-
ments of two exquisitely finished stone
statues. Having crossed the head of
the great lake and ascended a small
stream, we were conducted on elephants
to Siam-rap, in which the ruins are
situated. Siam-rap is a strongly forti-
fied town: half an hour's ride through a
grand old forest brought us to Ongor
Watt, or the temple of Ongor or Nakon.
The natives stated that a flight of angels
came down from heaven and built these
temples. The vastness of the temples of
Ongor suggests comparison with the
pyramids of Düreth, and the wonderful
conception and design of the whole with
the classic antiquities of Greece. From
the extent, it appears to have been the
work of generations, and, from its sym-
metry, the work of a single genius. It
was with feelings of intense awe that we
left the forest path to ascend the worn
steps of the outer causeway. On our
left, a colossal statue of a lion lay half-
buried in the sand. Standing on the
great outer causeway, our eyes wandered
from its exquisitely fitted bridges of
free-stone across the broad [dutch?] sur-
rounding the temple to the great entrance
of the western gallery, whose massive
square pillars stood out in bold relief in
the bright sunshine, and beyond the
great central mitre-shaped tower about
seven hundred yards distant. We passed
through the entrance of the gallery to
find a second causeway of greater ex-
tent; there we saw the temple in all its
magnificence, with its pillared galleries
rising tier above tier, and terminating in
the great tower. We ascended through
sculptured staircases, colonnades, and
corridors, crossed over paved courts,
having ornamental reservoirs, until we
reached the central tower, where we could
see the rectangular area, occupied by the
building, measuring 1000 by 1080 yards.
In the ancient city of Ongor Thom,
situated a little north of Ongor Watt,
many of the ruins were supposed to be
of superior antiquity to that of Ongor
Watt, and in their grotesque sculptures
to bear more resemblance to the an-
tiquities of Hindostan, Ceylon, and Java.
Mr. Thomson then described at great
length, and in minute detail, the form and
character of the sculptured temples, which
showed, he said, the high state of civiliza-
tion the ancient Cambodians had arrived
at; and he concluded by pointing out a
peculiar phenomenon in connection with
Sala Sap, the great Lake of Cambodia.
During the rainy season this lake is made
a breakwater for the reception of the
overflow of the great Mekong river, which
flows through Cambodia into the Gulf
of Siam; this river unites with the outlet
of the lake. From this point during the
rainy season the natural current from
the lake is driven back by the strength
of the flood from the Mekong river,
which continues to pour its annual over-
flow into the lake until the waters have
risen four feet. This great body of
water, over one hundred miles long and
sixty or seventy at the greatest breadth,
is not liberated until the end of the
rainy season, when it flows through its
natural outlet into the gulf.—PRESBYTER-

An Extinct Race.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the most remarkable races that
ever inhabited the earth is now extinct.
They were known as the Guanches, and
were the aborigines of the Canary Islands.
In the sixteenth century, pestilence, slav-
ery, and the cruelty of the Spaniards,
succeeded in totally exterminating them.
They are described as having been gi-
gantic in stature, but of a singularly mild
and gentle nature. Their food consisted
of barley, wheat, and goat's milk, and
their agriculture was of the rudest kind.
They had a religion which taught them
of a future state, of rewards and punish-
ments after death, and of good and evil
spirits. They regarded the volcano of
Teneriffe as a place of punishment for
the bad. The bodies of their dead were
carefully embalmed, and deposited in
catacombs, which still continue to be an
object of curiosity to those who visit the
islands. Their marriage rites were very
solemn; and, before engaging in them,
the bride were fattened on milk. At
the present day, these strange people are
totally extinct.—PRESBYTERIAN.{{< /news/text >}}

Bleeding from the Nose.

{{< news/text >}}Some two years ago, while going down
Broadway, New York, blood commenced
dropping from my nose quite rapidly.
I stepped aside and applied my handker-

saying:—-“Just put a piece of paper in
your mouth, chew it rapidly, and it will
stop your nose bleeding.” Thanking
him rather doubtfully, I did as he sug-

most immediately. I have seen the
remedy tried since quite frequently, and
with success always. Doubtless any sub-
stance would answer the same purpose
as well as paper, the stoppage of the flow
of blood being caused doubtless by the
rapid motion of the jaws, and the con-

Count Bismark.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}KARL OTTO VON BISMARCK auf Schön-
hausen, the bold and dexterous Minister
who has conquered Germany for Prussia,
was born at Brandenburg, in 1813.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the earlier part of his career, Herr
von Bismarck does not appear to have
shown any promise of future distinction.
He was educated successively at the Uni-
versities of Göttingen, Greifswalde, and
Berlin, where he is said to have been ad-
dicted beyond measure to the boisterous
pleasures of the German Burschen, and to
have displayed no great proficiency in his
studies. It is even asserted that he failed
to pass the requisite examination for enter-
ing the civil service, and was admitted by
special favour. His father was a country
squire of noble birth and moderate estate;
but more than one member of his family
had bold high office, and Otto von Bis-
marck was not without the aid of influen-
tial patrons. Nevertheless, he had obtain-
ed no higher promotion than the post of
Superintendent of Dykes in the Altmark
up to the time of his election, in 1847, as
a member of the Prussian Diet, having
previously had a seat in the provincial as-
sembly of that part of the kingdom where
he dwelt. He was immediately noticed as
one of the most vehement and even inso-
lent champions of the Junker or Tory
party, as he ostentatiously professed his
contempt for the principles of constitution-
al government, ridiculed the practice of
parliamentary debate, denied that the
King of Prussia was bound to grant those
franchises which had been solemnly pro-
mised at the time of the war against Na-
poleon, and declared that the Royal prero-
gative was derived, not from the consent
of the people, but from the grace of God,
and was practically unlimited save by the
voluntary concessions of the Royal bounty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These opinions were not the extravagant
conceits of youth, but have been asserted
by Herr von Bismarck on all occasions
since he began to take a conspicuous place
in public life, which was in the thirty-fifth
year of his age. He has repeatedly de-
nounced the freedom of the press, and the
spread of intelligence among the working
classes; he has gone so far as to express a
wish that the large manufacturing and
commercial towns could be destroyed, so
that a purely rural population might sub-
missively obey the behests of an absolute
ruler. These and similar utterances of
rampant Toryism, such as can scarcely be
matched by any instance in the history of
English parties, rendered Herr von Bis-
marck one of the most unpopular men of
his time. He was excluded from the Ger-
man National Assembly of 1848, and lived
some months in retirement; but in the
following year, upon the triumph of the
reactionary party, he took his seat in the
Chamber of Deputies at Berlin as member
for the district of Zauche. Here, again, he
was the bitterest assailant of the Moderate
Liberals, and was accustomed to deride
the aspirations towards German unity
which the so-called Gotha party already
began to encourage, as associated with the
cause of constitutional liberty in Prussia.
Herr von Bismarck, for his part, maintain-
ed that it was to Prussianism, not to Ger-
manism, that they must look for the safety
and advancement of the State. He affected
in those days to venerate Austria as the
proper representative of the ancient pow-
er of Germany, while he censured the
struggle for Schleswig-Holstein as a petty
act of revolution, and an infringement of
the rights of the King of Denmark. As an
instance of his sagacity on questions of
political economy, it is remembered that
he was the advocate of a law by which
the trade guilds should be empowered, as
in the Middle Ages, to fix an arbitrary
price for every sort of goods to be sold,
and to prescribe the number of apprentices
who should be brought up to each trade.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In 1851, Herr von Bismarck was admit-
ted to the diplomatic service, and sent as
first secretary of legation to the Prussian
Embassy at Frankfort; but, within three
months of his arrival at this post, was
elevated, by an extraordinary promotion,
to that of ambassador at the sittings of the
Federal Bund. He had evidently been
selected for his independent and supercili-
ous bearing, on purpose to bid defiance
to Count Rechberg, who was then Austrian
Ambassador at Frankfort and President
of the Diet. Many amusing stories are
told of the encounters between them, Herr
von Bismarck, by his high spirits, wit, and
courage, usually getting the better of his
more dignified antagonist, who was once
so plainly insulted by the Prussian that
they were on the point of fighting a duel.
It became necessary, therefore, to recall
Herr von Bismarck from Frankfort, and he
was transferred to the embassy at St.
Petersburg, where he entered into intimate
relations with Prince Gortschakoff, then
busy with schemes for a triple alliance of
Russia, Prussia, and France, by which each
of those Powers was to acquire an exten-
sive addition to its territories at the ex-
pense of Austria, Turkey, Belgium, and
the smaller German States. The Crimean
War however, prevented, or at least post-
poned, the execution of these projects,
which seem not to have been agreed to by
the Emperor of the French, and were af-
terwards disavowed by the Prince Regent
of Prussia, who at that time was unwilling
to entertain any plans of self-aggrandi-
sement at the expense of his brother so-
vereigns.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After his accession to the throne a
change, apparently for the worse, came
over the state of Prussia. The Liberal in-
fluences of the Crown Prince, the Prince
of Hohenzollern, and their friends, now
gave way to the intrigues of the Junkers,
or, as they are sometimes called, from the
title of their newspaper organ, the KREUZ
ZEITUNG party. Count Bernstorff having
become Minister of Foreign Affairs instead
of Herr von Schleinitz, a new line of for-
eign policy was resolved upon, though it
was necessarily to be kept dark till the
views of the other European Powers could
be ascertained. Herr von Bismarck, leav-
ing Count Goltz to succeed him at the
Russian Court, had no sooner returned to
Berlin than it was intimated by the French
Minister that the Emperor Napoleon
would like to see Bismarck as Prussian
Plenipotentiary at the Tuileries. He had
more than once spoken in favour of a
French alliance, under certain circum-
stances, previously to the war between
France and Austria in 1859. Herr von
Bismarck thus became Prussian Ambas-
sador at Paris ; but what passed between
him and the Emperor Napoleon is best
known to themselves. It has been gener-
ally believed that they understand each
other pretty well.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In September, 1862, Herr von Bismarck
was summoned home to Berlin, and in-
trusted with the task of forming a new
Ministry, over which he has since presided,
with the portfolio of Foreign Affairs,
Count Eulenburg being Minister of the
Interior; Herr von Roon, Minister of War;
and Bodelschwingh and Von der Heydt
successively Finance Ministers. The whole
course of their administration, from 1862
down to the outbreak of the late war, has
been a pertinacious conflict against the
majority of the Chamber, whose votes
have been impudently set at nought, and
whose Constitutional power to control
the public expenditure has been nullified,
while the Prime Minister has coolly de-
clared that he and his colleagues will not
be responsible to Parliament, and that
they consider themselves only servants of
the Crown. The subject-matter of the
original dispute was the augmentation of
the army estimates and the law extending
the period of compulsory service in the
army to three years. The Chamber hav-
ing, by majorities of 272 against 68, and
of 251 against 36, decided these questions
against the Government, Bismarck dissol-
ved the Chamber, after a series of angry
altercations, and informed them that the
King would dispense with their approval
of the budget, and would put in execution
whatever measures he thought best for the
public service. The deputies, being more
submissive than our English Parliament
in the reign of Charles I., went their ways
quietly home. The newspapers which
ventured to comment on this high-handed
procedure of the Government were pro-
secuted with great severity ; and those
public officials, magistrates, or university
professors, who dared to raise their voices
on behalf of the Constitution, were punish-
ed by removal to distant places, if not by
the loss of office. It should, however, be
observed that the arbitrary proceedings of
the Prussian Government did not, as in
the English case of the "ship money," or
"the tallage and poundage," extend so far
as the levying of taxes without lawful
authority, by a mere edict of the Crown,
the fact being that the revenue of the
Crown of Prussia was fixed by a permanent
settlement, and was nowise dependent on
the annual votes of Parliament.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus practically despotic, the rule of
King William I. and Bismarck, his Min-
ister, during the last three or four years,
has been directed with astonishing suc-
cess, though by conduct which history will
perhaps stigmatise as perfidious and
double-dealing, to the achievement of
those grand objects, the expulsion of Aus-
tria from the German political system,
and the consequent union of the several
States of North Germany to the Prussian
kingdom, which are regarded by most im-
partial observers as a change beneficial to
the interests of European peace and civili-
sation. Nor can we doubt that these re-
sults are equally acceptable to the nation-
al spirit of the Germans. It is unnecessary
here to review the series of transactions
relative to the Schleswig-Holstein pro-
vinces, which led to the open quarrel be-
tween Prussia on the one hand, and Aus-
tria, with the minor States of Germany,
on the other, finally issuing in the rupture
and decisive war of last midsummer. It would
be a difficult task to attempt to vindicate
the honesty and good faith of the Prussian
Government in these transactions ; but the
skill and valour of the Prussian army, the
intelligence and patriotic spirit of the
Prussian people, have justly earned for
their country a degree of political and
military importance second to none of the
Powers of Europe.—ILL. LON. NEWS.{{< /news/text >}}

The Sky an Indicator
of the Weather.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The color of the sky, at particular
times, affords wonderful good guidance.
Not only does a very rosy sunset presage
good weather, and a ruddy sunrise bad
weather, but there are other tints which
speak with equal clearness and accuracy.
A bright yellow sky in the evening indi-
cates wind; a pale yellow, wet; a neu-
tral gray color constitutes a favorable
sign in the evening, and an unfavorable
one in the morning. The clouds are
again full of meaning in themselves. If
their forms are soft, undefined, and full
feathery, the weather will be fine; if
their edges are hard, sharp, and definite,
it will be foul. Generally speaking, any
deep, unusual hues betoken wind or rain;
while the more quiet and delicate tints
be-speak fair weather. These are simple
maxims; and yet not so simple but the
British Board of Trade has thought fit
to publish them for the use of seafaring
men.—-SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.{{< /news/text >}}
