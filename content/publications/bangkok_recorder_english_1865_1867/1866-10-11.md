Dr. Miller's Duck Story.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The late Dr. Miller, of Princeton, as
all his students will remember, abounded
in anecdotes, which he related to his
classes from year to year, to illustrate
the points made in his lectures. One of
them occurs to us just now, as specially
applicable to the new converts which
have recently come into the churches
within the bounds of our circulation: A
celebrated judge in Virginia was, in his
earlier years, skeptical to the truth of the
Bible, and especially to the reality of ex-
perimental religion. He had a favorite
servant who accompanied him in his tra-
vels round his circuit. As they passed
from court-house to court-house, they
frequently conversed on the subject of
religion, the servant, Harry, venturing
at times to remonstrate with his master
against his infidelity. As the judge had
confidence in Harry's honesty and sincer-
ity, he asked him a great many questions
as to how he felt and what he thought
on various points. Amongst other things
Harry told his master that he was often
very sorely tempted and tried by the de-
vil. The judge asked Harry to explain
how it happened that the devil attacked
him (Harry), who was so pious a man, so
sorely, whilst he allowed himself, who
was an infidel and a sinner, to pass un-
noticed and untempted. Harry asked,
"Are you right sure, master, that he does
let you pass without troubling you?
"Certainly I am," replied the judge; "I
have no dealings with him at all. I do
not even so much as know that there is
any such being in existence as the devil.
If there is any such being he never trou-
bles me." "Well," said Harry, "I know
that there is a devil, and that he tries me
sorely at times." A day or two after-
wards, when the judge had gotten through
his docket, he concluded to go on a hunt
for wild ducks on one of the streams
which lay across his road homeward
Harry accompanied him. As they ap-
proached the river they espied a flock of
ducks quietly floating on its surface.
The judge stealthily crept up the bank
and fired upon them, killing two or three
and wounding as many others. He at
once threw down his gun and made stren-
uous efforts, with the aid of clubs and
stones, to secure the wounded ducks,
whilst he permitted the dead ones to float
on, for the time, unnoticed by him. Har-
ry, as he sat on the seat of the carriage,
watched his master's movements with deep
interest, and when he returned, said to
him: "Massa, whilst you was a splashin'
in de water after dem wounded ducks,
and lettin' de dead ones float on, it just
come into my mind, why it is dat de de-
vil troubles me so much, whilst he lets
you alone. You are like de dead ducks;
he's sure he's got you safe. I'm like de
wounded ones, trying to git away from
him, and he's afraid I'll do it, so he makes
all de fuss after me and jist lets you float
on down de stream. He knows he can
git you at any time; but he knows its
now or never wid me. If you were to
begin to flutter a little and show signs
like you were agoin' to git away from
him, he would make jist as big a splashin'
after you."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The illustration struck the learned
judge with great force, and led him to
reinvestigate the grounds of his skeptic-
ism, and, through Harry's instrumentali-
ty, he was fully brought to sit with him
at the feet of Jesus to learn of him.
The illustration is a homely one, but it
sets forth a great truth in the experiences
of those who set out in the Christian
course. They must expect to be assailed
by Satan as they never were before. If
he fails of success in causing their fall
by the use of one form of temptation, he
will try another. He is a cunning old
fox. He has tried so long, and had so
much to do with men, that he is now an
adept in devising means to ruin them, and
make them as miserable and degraded as
himself. Young Christians, therefore,
should not think it strange concerning
the fiery trials which are to try them, as
though some strange thing had happened
to them, hitherto unknown methods of
assault. As long as the devil feels that
sinners are safe, and that he is sure to
get them at last, he allows them to float
on quietly upon an unruffled current;
but the moment they attempt to throw
off his yoke, and to assert their indepen-
dence of him, they must expect his wrath
to wax exceeding hot, and his assaults to
fall thick and fast upon their heads.
They should not be ignorant of his de-
vices. He goes about as a roaring lion,
seeking whom he may devour.—-PRES.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The effect of Sadowa on
the Papacy.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Spectator.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The results of this contest in Europe, if
it ends, as all Englishmen now expect that
it must end, in a complete final victory for
Prussia, are so vast that the mind refuses
to grasp them except one by one, and even
then only at intervals. Just at this mo-
ment the British public can attend only to
the effect of the campaign upon Austria
and France, but it will modify the position
of every power in Europe in a nearly equal
degree. France loses at once her dictator-
ship, and sinks, as the ECONOMIST has
pointed out, into one of many co-ordinate
powers; Austria becomes the natural pro-
tector of the nationalities of the East, in-
stead of the natural foe of the nationalities
of the West; and Russia finds an impass-
ible barrier erected between herself and the
civilized half of the European world. With
Germany constituted, it becomes useless
for England to waste time and character
in protecting an insolvent Mussulman
horde, while Scandinavia gains an ally a-
mong whose immediate and pressing inter-
ests will be the freedom of the Baltic.
Upon no power, however, will the blow
fall so heavily as on the Papacy, which lost
at Sadowa infinitely more than it has for-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}felted during the last six disastrous years,
for it lost the chance of regaining all. Had
Austria won the game, and an Austrian
army been billeted in Berlin, Rome would
hardly have been evacuated within this
generation, and Umbria and the Marches
might have been replaced under the priest-
ly sway its subjects so bitterly detest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The world, as it appears to the Vatican,
will be divided among six great States, and
of these France will be Voltairian, Prussia
Lutheran, Britain on all Papal questions
Calvanistic, Russia Greek and hostile, Italy
Catholic but anti-Papal, and Austria Pa-
pal, but bound by the evil prejudices of
the Hungarians, who are anxious to be
shown by the Church the way to heaven,
but think they can see their road on earth
for themselves. Spain is orthodox, to be
sure, but then Spain is also sceptical, gov-
erned by men who detest all schism, but
who also detest wars for a creed in which
they only half believe ; and then could
Spain beat Italy? The prospect is dark
on every side ; Italy consolidated, Germa-
ny united, Austria moved eastward, Bava-
ria paralyzed, Spain left helpless, Rome
seething with hatred under their feet, the
poor priests are thrown back on Heaven
and Napoleon as their only protectors, and
while Heaven gives victory to infidels, Na-
poleon refuses to intervene and save the
faithful. The changes are all so sudden,
too, and the men who conduct them so
violent, there is no time for intrigue, and
what can one do with a Protestant aristo-
crat like Bismark, who treats Popes as if
they were petty princes, and compels them
to consecrate Bishops as if a concordat
were a secular treaty to be enforced by the
bayonet, who does not even believe, like
Mr. Disraeli, that the “independence of
of the Papacy is essential to the European
equilibrium ?” Mr. Disraeli is in power, it
is true, but then his Ministry accepts or-
ders from Orangemen, and if it did not,
would not dare in the face of every Eng-
lish rector to interfere for Rome. Verily,
Satan is abroad more visibly than in 1848,
for then there was aid to be obtained from
the Powers ; in greater strength than in
1860, for then all depended on a single
life, and a life in the long duration of the
Papacy is scarcely an appreciable point of
time. The new changes will be permanent,
and Napoleon will pass away.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The temporal power must end, even
should the Pope remain in Rome, for he
could only be safe under Italian bayonets,
and an Italian Pontiff exercising power
through Italians only over an Italian po-
pulation, must be either an arch priest or
a lieutenant-general of the secular Sovereign
of Italy. Flight is the only alterna-
tive, and though this will be pressed upon
the Pope by the Jesuits and the fanatics
who think his departure will disturb the
order of the world, there are more mode-
rate men around him, who ask whither he
is to fly. The hand of France will, he
knows well, be heavier than that of Italy,
no Italian priest or prince will willingly
live in Germany, the Balearic Isles are too
isolated for a Court which is still one of
the great centres of human action, and in
Malta, the refuge towards which the mind
of Pope Pius most readily turns, he must
conciliate a heretical power. * * * *{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The struggle for temporal power once
closed, there will be no need for applying
a test which drives away able men, and a
genius either on or behind the Holy Chair
becomes once more a terrible possibility.
If such a man should arise, a man, for in-
stance, who saw how easily Rome could
link herself with the social aspirations of
the masses, who could give to her vast
hierarchy, which still extends through eve-
ry grade of human life, still dwells in pa-
laces and lazarettos, among princes as a-
mong convists, the order to defend the peo-
ple, there may yet be a career before the
Papacy as magnificent as the one which,
unless a miracle supervenes, must end
with Pius IX. Even without such a genius
the change may be tremendous, FOR FROM
THE DAY OF THE EXTINCTION OF THE
TEMPORAL POWER THE PAPACY MUST IN-
EVITABLY ALLY ITSELF WITH DEMOCRACY,
and in that simple fact what possibilities
are not contained ! She has nothing more
to hope or fear from the Kings, everything
to hope and fear from those masses who
have not yet risen to the level at which
men reject all guidance, who alone, of all
the forces now rising, can coerce the in-
tellectual class which has finally thrown
off sacerdotal authority, and who are ten-
ding more rapidly day by day all over Eu-
rope towards organizations which Rome
knows how to administer, which are in fact
but poor imitations of many of her own
Orders. We find associations of agricul-
ture very difficult to manage, but the men
who built Woburn did not, and Benedicti-
nes are not the people most likely to be
blind to the powers and the difficulties in-
herent in co-operative life. We need not
say we should regard such a transforma-
tion of the Papacy with alarm, for the sa-
cerdotal caste seems to us, of all others,
the worst fitted to lead the multitudes
through the desert into the promised land
which, as the French Utopians say, they
see beyond the Red Sea, but the transfor-
mation has become possible, and Sadowa
may yet be a date in the spiritual history
of mankind.—THE FRIEND OF INDIA.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Mr. Gladstone.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
BY MOSES COIT TYLER.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The prospects of the Liberal cause in
England—-the issues of those momentous
designs of a statesmanship more enligh-
tened and magnanimous than Europe has
hitherto seen—-are seemingly so bound up
with the political future of Mr. Gladstone,
that it will repay us to glance at the
causes of this relentless personal opposition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}1. There is one phrase which, in the up-
per circles of English society, is more
damning to the man to whom it may be
applied than any other in the whole voca-
bulary of depreciation. It is the phrase
"political adventurer"—the modern synon-
ysm of the Latin "NOVUS HOMO;" the
phrase with which the old Roman patri-
cians sought to blast the career of Cicero;
the phrase which, in our own century, has
been hurled by English patricians at the
greatest statesmen in it—at Canning,
Huskisson, Henry Brougham, Richard
Cobden, and William Ewart Gladstone.
The unpardonable offense of Mr. Glad-
stone is that he neither got himself born
nor got himself married into any of the
thirty-one great governing families of
England. It is true that he is wealthy,
that his father was a baronet, that the as-
sociations of his life have been aristocra-
tic; yet he is neither a Cavendish, nor a
Courtney, nor a Stanley, nor a Cecil. By
his genius, by his goodness, by his past re-
nown, by his stupendous popularity, they
perceive that Mr. Gladstone is to be Eng-
land's real monarch for the next decade
and a half. They are wrathful that ano-
ther supreme minister has risen from the
middle-class. Either Mr. Gladstone should
not have been so great a man, or he should
not have allowed himself to be born out
of their set.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}2. The second reason to explain the op-
position to him is one even more ignoble—
the envy of old comrades at his success.
By the trophies of this Miltiades there are
some scores of ambitious fellows in Parlia-
ment who cannot sleep. The men who
witnessed the glory of Lord Palmerston's
later years could exult in it with a satis-
faction unalloyed by so base a passion as I
now refer to: he was of an elder genera-
tion, and was above the range of their jea-
lousy. But such illustrious personages as
Robert Lowe, Mr. Laing, Mr. Horseman,
Sir Robert Peel, Lord Cranbourne, Lord
A. Montagu, look upon themselves as the
equals of Mr. Gladstone, because they are
his contemporaries; and they cannot for-
give him because the general opinion of
England does not coincide with theirs in
that respect. I have wondered whether
the moon ever gets into a rage when it
happens to find itself eclipsed. If that be
the case, there is a striking analogy be-
tween the moon and several of Mr. Glad-
stone's old associates.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}3. There is one other serious objection
to Mr. Gladstone, operating not alone up-
on those to whom I have already referred,
but upon a multitude of others: he is an
earnest man. His political views are not
jests, but convictions. With him political
life seems to be neither an ostentation,
nor a disguised selfishness, nor a comedy;
but a consecration. The principle English
politicians, however, who are just now at
the surface, have grown up under the ex-
ample of Lord Palmerston, and have been
morally debauched by the success of that
splendid political sadducee. With a fa-
cile smile, a jovial bearing, incredulous as
to the higher maxims of public conduct,
worldly, materialistic, they look upon
statesmanship as a highly respectable and
remunerative farce; they regard election
pledges as a play with words; they admire
the gift of blarney as the chief attribute
of a first minister, and they think the
most serious plea sufficiently refuted by
the most trivial pun. Of course, such men
cannot comprehend earnestness: it arouses
either their ridicule or their rage. When
they see it in ordinary men, they laugh at
it; they banter it; they try to smother it
between a shower of{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
"Quips and cranks and wanton wiles."
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}But when they behold this spirit in the
alliance of personal greatness, kindling an
eloquence whose majesty overwhelms them,
vitalizing a scholarship whose vastness fills
them with awe, crowning and glorifying a
nature whose dignity silences the patter of
their shallow facetiousness, what is left to
them but hate—a hostility hardened into
utter vindictiveness, and gnashing its teeth
in an ecstasy of loathing?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}No discerning person could have sat in
the House of Commons this session, could
have heard the tone of the opposing
speeches, could have seen and heard how
"the first assembly of gentlemen in the
world" was capable of resolving itself in-
to a zoological garden of wild-beasts, of
magpies and monkeys, bowling, bellowing,
screeching, chattering, in one prolonged
chorus of brutal fury against the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer, without perceiv-
ing that there was an antagonism between
him and them only to be explained by that
tremendous gulf of moral unlikeness of
which I have spoken.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the agony is now over. England is
to have a Tory government. It may last
a few weeks; it may last a few months;
but not long will the people endure it.
Probably, before the first anniversary of
his resignation, the heart of England will
call again to the foremost place her best
beloved and her ablest statesman.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the whole, the interregnum is not to
be regretted. It will be good for England
to be reminded what a Tory ministry is
like. It will be good for the Liberal party
to have an experience of adversity. It
will be pre-eminently good for Mr. Glad-
stone to have a year of repose.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This very evening, I went down to the
House, to hear the ministerial statement
of the Queen's decision. I found Old Pa-
lace Yard thronged with people eager to
see the arrival of the chieftains of both
parties. An English crowd never minces
matters, or expresses itself with ambigu-
ity. They growled, and groaned, and shook
their fists at the men who have defeated
the measure for the people's enfranchise-
ment; and, as they recognised the cham-
pions of the people's cause, they heaped
cheers and benedictions upon their heads.
But, just as "Big Ben" sounded from his
regal tower the hour of six, we heard a
roar of voices far away down Parliament
street, and presently Mr. Gladstone, with
Mrs. Gladstone at his side, drove in an
open carriage into the yard. How the hats
went off, and how the cheers went up from
those thousands of throats! Had he been
king, he could not have had a grander re-
ception. Climbing upon one of the pilas-
ters of Westminster Hall, holding on with
one hand, swinging my hat with the other,
and mingling my not very despicable Yan-
kee shouts with that immense gush of Bri-
tish enthusiasm, I had a fine view of the
minister who was just to announce that
the Queen had accepted his resignation.
He has the face and the port of a states-
man. But, as he lifted his hat and res-
ponded to the salutes of the people, he
looked pale, and haggard, and weary. As
the carriage swept round under the arch-
way leading to the members' private en-
trance, Mrs. Gladstone rose, and threw
back over the multitudes a look of inex-
pressible happiness, and gratitude, and
wifely pride. How welcome to the jaded
statesman must be this release from the
toils of office. And this interlude of much
needed rest may save him from the fate of
so many of his predecessors, and may pre-
serve to England a life which has already
given a new luster to English eloquence
and to English statesmanship, and a new
impulse to the enlightenment and happi-
ness of mankind.-—THE INDEPENDENT.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}IN A Connecticut parish, a subscription
paper was recently started for the sup-

{{< news/text >}}THE Memphis BULLETIN says, the body
of a man was found lately in Memphis
in such a condition as to leave no doubt
that he had been murdered. The police,
finding no clue, decided on trying photo-
graphy, and accordingly, on the day of
the murder, with the aid of a microscope,
images left on the retina of the eye of
the dead, were transferred to paper, and

{{< news/text >}}THE new license law is to go into force
in New York City, on the first of May.
The law contains some new features, and
if it can be executed, will accomplish
much good. Under the new law, the
Commissioners of the Board of Health
are constituted a Board of Excise, who
shall have exclusive power of granting
licenses for the sales of liquors on Sun-
day, or on election days, within a quarter
of a mile of the election. No liquor is
to be sold to any apprentice, without the
consent of his master or mistress, nor to
any person under eighteen years of age,
without the consent of his father, mother,
or guardian. None is to be sold to an
habitual drunkard, nor to an intoxicated
person; nor against the request of any
wife, husband, parent, or child, to the
husband of any such wife, wife of such
husband, parent of such child, or child of
such parent. Liquor shops are to be
closed between midnight and sunrise, and
on Sunday. No person who trusts an-
other for liquors can compel payment at
law. INTOXICATION is made a criminal
offense, subject to a fine of ten dollars
and costs. Adequate fines and penalties
are provided for all the specific offences,
and the act is drawn throughout with
evident care and thoroughness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}GEN. GRANT, in a recent conversation
with Rev. George Hepworth of Boston,
said of Gen. Sherman: "Sherman is a
man to be proud of. He is impetuous,
he is faulty, but he knows his own faults
as soon as any man." And of Sheridan
he said: "He is the best man in Ameri-
ca. He has no peer. He can wield any
force. He is pure hearted, simple-man-
nered, and a truly noble man." And of
himself he said: "There were a thousand
others who could have done the same
thing as well as I. I am thankful to God
that He helped me to do the work, but
had I not been living, or had the Govern-
ment passed over me, there are other
men who would have won the victory for
you."{{< /news/text >}}

Tanon Charon Kroong.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Most of our local readers will re-
cognise in this name that it is one
given by the king to the New road, or
street, which he caused to be made,
three or four years since, from the
royal palace down the eastern side of
the river three miles or more in the
rear of the main body of the foreign
community of the city. We are hap-
py to learn that His Majesty has quite
recently much improved the street
by having sea-beach sand spread thick-
ly over it, so that such horrible mud
as was ever to be waded through last
year after a rain is now never seen,
and that even in our wettest days,
this month of rain, it is quite comfor-
table walking on it. Much praise, we
say, to his Majesty for this timely and
significant consideration, not only for
the comfort of his own subjects, but
also for the welfare of the European
community on that side of the river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now we beg to express a lively
hope to His Majesty that this noble
deed of making and improving that
street, it being the beginning of beau-
tifying his capital after European
science and advancement, will lead
him onward in the same direction un-
til he shall have made many other
streets for the prosperity of Bangkok,
for surely a great work needs to be
done in this line. Why, only think
of it—-On the western side of the river
from Bangkok-yai southward three
miles or more, through a dense popula-
tion, there is nothing worthy the name
of a street. Where people walk from
one part of it to another, they are
obliged to go Indian file on the most
narrow, tortuous, and filthy foot paths,
dodging around this man’s house and
that man’s pig-stye, on a narrow slab or
a coacoanut log, over ditches and sloughs,
and crossing canals on rickety foot
bridges. In short the bridges are such
as it would be quite preposterous to
think of driving any thing over them
but men and goats.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Now be it known, that one of the
most powerful arms of the Siamese
government is on the western side of
the river, and many of the most weal-
thy native merchants live there also.
How long, we beg to ask that arm of
government, are we to wait ere he will
use his powerful influence in improving
his side of the city of Bangkok, by a
wide street from his own beautiful pa-
lace down in the rear of that dense
population ? And in our humble opin-
ion, that road should not stop where the
people cease to be dense, but should
proceed onward to Paknam, which
would be a much shorter cut to that
town than the one contemplated on
the east side of the river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now while speaking of the im-
portance of having many new streets
made, we beg again to suggest to the
government the importance of having
some Police force to protect the in-
habitants on and near Charon kroong.
It is in a part of the city in which the
government has always preferred that
all the consuls and the main body of the
foreign merchants should live ; and
now, with a prominent view to their
comfort and welfare, as well as for
other noble objects, has made the new
street which of course is drawing into
the rear of these foreigners a great
population, of all classes of Siamese
subjects, thus rendering the property
and lives of the European and Ameri-
can much more exposed than they
otherwise would be. Is it not hence ma-
nifestly the duty of the government to
carry forward the improvement of that
street until a thorough Police force
shall have been established upon it ?
The great Bazar street is well protec-
ted by a Police, and much praise is
due the government for it. Is the
new street less deserving of this favor ?
Does not the new treaty relations into
which the Siamese government have
entered with the western nations re-
quire this on the part of the govern-
ment ? Now the street is wholly un-
protected, and has become notorious
for its dens of thieves and robbers.
And blackguards are so numerous
about it that it is quite dangerous for
European ladies to walk on it even in
the day time. Witness the reports
which we have been compelled to
make of the character of the street in
our present issue. Why ? They are
horrible—-and the case seems to be
coming worse and worse.{{< /news/text >}}

Sandwich Islands No. 3.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}King Kamehameha I, though adher-
ing firmly to his idolatry until death,
ventured to make some marked inno-
vations in some of the customs con-
nected with it. He would not allow
any human sacrifices to be made for
himself in his last sickness which was
customary in such cases. Nor would
he consent that any such sacrifices
should be made for his spirit after
death. But in lieu of this his people
made a sacrifice of three hundred
dogs at his obsequies. The customary
wailings were made for him through-
out the Islands. The people shaved
their heads, burned themselves, knock-
ed out their front teeth, and broke
over all restraints as usual at the
death of the king, practicing all man-
ner of crimes, self torture, licentious-
ness, robbery, and murder.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Liholiho, the eldest son of Kame-
hameha succeeded to the throne at the
age of twenty two years. Kaahuma-
nu one of his father's principal wives
whom her royal husband had allowed
to share with him the responsibilities
of government, he made his Premier.
His own mother's name was Keopuola-
ni. These two royal women ultimate-
ly became nursing mothers to the
Church of Christ on the Islands.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Soon after the accession of Liholiho
in 1819 an event occurred in the royal
family which as Dr. Anderson well
remarks "has scarcely a parallel in
history, giving an affirmative answer
to the inquiry of the prophet. "Hath
a nation changed her gods in a day?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“The tabu system of restrictions
and prohibitions was inseparable from
the national idolatry. They extended
to sacred days, sacred places, sacred
persons, and sacred things; and the
least failure to observe them was pun-
ished with death. A prohibition,
which weighed as heavily as any other,
was that in regard to eating, and was
the first to be violated. A husband
could on no occasion eat with his wife
except on penalty of death. Women
were prohibited, on the same penalty,
from eating many of the choicest
kinds of meat, fruit, and fish. These
prohibitions extended to female chiefs
as well as to women of low rank.
Many of the highest chiefs of the na-
tion were females. They did not fear
being killed by the priests, for they
were chiefs ; but the priests, all along,
had made them believe that, if they
violated any prohibition, they would
be destroyed by the gods. This they
began to doubt, for they saw foreigners
living with impunity without any such
observances. Besides, a fact which
shows the power of God to bring good
out of evil, ardent spirits had been
introduced among them ; and they of-
ten, when partially intoxicated, tram-
pled heedlessly on the prohibitions of
their idolatry, and yet were not des-
troyed by the gods. The awful dread
therefore which formerly existed, had
in a measure subsided ; and when no
longer restrained by fear, the female
chiefs were quite ready to throw off
the burdens so long imposed upon
them. Keopuolani, the mother of the
king, first violated the system, by eat-
ing with her youngest son. Other
chiefs, when they saw no evil follow,
were inclined to imitate her example.
But the king was slow to yield. At
length, however he gave his assent,
and then the work was done. The
chiefs, as a body, trampled on all the
unpleasant restraints which had been
imposed upon them by their system
of idolatry. In doing this, they were
aware that they threw off allegiance
to their gods, and treated them with
open contempt. They saw that they
took the stand of open revolt. They
immediately gave orders to the people
that the tabu system should be disre-
garded, the idols committed to the
flames, and the sacred temples demol-
ished. (1.){{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The high priest Hewahewa, having
resigned his office, was the first to ap-
ply the torch. Without his co-opera-
tion the attempt to destroy the old
system would have been ineffectual.
Numbers of his profession, joining in
the enthusiasm, followed his example.
Kaumualii, having given his sanction,
idolatry was forever abolished by law,
and the smoke of heathen sanctuaries
arose from Hawaii to Kauai. All the
islands united in a jubilee at their de-
liverance, and presented the spectacle
of a nation without a religion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“But civil war was the immediate
consequence. A principal chief rose,
with a portion of the people, in a re-
bellion. A battle was fought on the
western shores of Hawaii, and the God
of battles gave victory on the side of
these innovations. The rebellious chief
was killed, and the whole mass of the
people went on with renewed zeal, de-
stroying the sacred enclosures and
idols. (2){{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Liholiho seems to have had no other
aim in these remarkable proceedings
than to be freed from restraint upon his
habits of dissipation; and it is thought
Kaahumanu, the strong minded dow-
ager queen favored the changes in order
to remove unreasonable disabilities
from her sex. No religious motive seems
to have had influence with any of them,
so far without any religion as to be
really in a less favorable state for self-
preservation than it was before. But
an unseen Power, though they knew
it not, was preparing them for the
speedy introduction of a better reli-
gion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The gods that used to be worship-
ed by the people of the Sandwich
islands were many. They had one de-
nominated the poison god, another
the volcano god, another the war god.
Their idols seem always to have been
made of wood—generally carved out
of a hard yellow wood—not larger than
a lad ten or twelve years old, and hence
quite portable, so that the chiefs were
enabled to have a present god in all
times of great public emergencies away
from home. It would appear, too, that
they had them often so small as to be
conveniently carried in their pockets.
Kamehameha I. it is said, always had
an idol of the poison god under his
pillow at night.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Their idols generally had some ugly
resemblance to human beings, but
some of them were of the most hob-
gobbling shapes unimaginable. The
poison god was the figure of a hideous
human monster of small proportions
having a wooly head and an open mouth
showing all its teeth. In its back was
a small hole for the repository of poison.
The war god called Taire was repre-
sented by wicker-work the size of an
adult man, covered with red feathers
having a monstrous head with a helmet
on it, a hideous mouth exhibiting
dozens of dogs'-teeth, and large eyes
made of mother of pearl. Another
god about which we have no means
of learning its place and power, is the
figure of a dwarfed man, quite fleshy,
with a head immensely larger than its
body, looking much as if it were carry-
ing a yearling elephant on its head,
which rests his right fore foot on its
right hand, and his left or its left hand.
Another called Luno is simply a pole
of hard wood ten feet long with a
small ghostly looking head at one
end. This would seem to have been
designed for carrying into battle. It
is singular that the natives supposed
Capt Cook, who was murdered by
them in 1779, an impersonification of
that god.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There were many other idols in use
among them, only a few months before
the American missionaries first visited
the island, but they seem not to have
been particularly described by any one
and hence little is known of them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It does not appear that the Sandwich
islanders ever had any molten gods, or
any made of mason work nor any
carved from stone.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Subversion of Idolatry
In Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Would that the principal chiefs of
Siam with the king at their head could
be made willing to lay this subject of
abolishing idolatry close to their
hearts, and study it with that attention
which it deserves! Their religion is
unquestionably as much a system of
idolatry as that of the Sandwich Islan-
ders. They worship Buddha through
the idols they have made to represent
him. It is certainly no less idolatrous
to worship a mere man through idols
of brick and mortar and of brass and
copper and silver and gold than through
blocks of wood. That the king of
Siam and a few of his chiefs are the
main pillars of the Buddhist idolatry
in Siam, and that the whole system,
mighty as it seems to be, would im-
mediately tumble to ruins if they
would but resolutely step out from its
support, there can be no reasonable
doubt. Nay, let but the king and the
two Prime Ministers set their hearts
against it as being a system, good only
for crushing the temporal and eternal
interests of its votaries, (which is its
true character,) and declare distinctly
that they will no longer give it their
sanction, they would carry with them
all other orders and ranks of the civil
power of Siam, and the whole mass of
the priesthood besides.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nay more, we think that we have
abundant evidence from our long ob-
servation of Siamese princes and lords,
priests and people to show that such
is their dependence on the lead of their
king, and such their confidence in his
learning and wisdom, that he could
himself alone subvert Buddhism in
Siam, by simply showing that he has
lost all confidence in it, and is deter-
mined no longer to support it by his
influence. Grant that idolatry in Siam
is far more powerful than that at the
Sandwich Islands; but is not the king
of Siam a far more powerful monarch
than king Liholiho! And is not the
former as able to do the greater work
as the latter was the smaller? It is re-
corded that when king Liholiho gave
his assent to the abolishing of idolatry
in his kingdom—-“the work was
done”—-that the high priest then resig-
ned his office, and was the first to ap-
ply the torch to the work which burnt
up all the idols and demolished all
their sacred temples. It was only the
assent of the king, and then the chiefs
and priests and people acted accor-
ding to their own free will, without an
order from the throne, and subverted
their idolatry as it were in a single day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now we think that the king of Siam
would have to do but little more than
give his assent, and the princes, lords,
priests, and people would by a great
majority go, even unbidden by their
king, to the work of opposing Buddh-
ism. Such a reformation as this would
doubtless create some opposition, but
it would, in our opinion, be that of
the puny arm of an old sick man to
one in all the vigor and strength of
manhood—yes a manhood armed with
the favor and blessing of the only
true and Almighty God.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Hence we feel constrained by his
Spirit to add, that the most fearful
responsibility is now resting on the
shoulders of His Majesty the king of
Siam, for it is he, single-handed, that is
leading all orders and ranks of his
people in the idolatry of Buddhism;
and as it is most certainly the road to
ruin temporal and eternal, eternal
justice will hold him responsible for it.{{< /news/text >}}

<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Recorder.-—We have been
much interested in looking over the
IX. chapter of First Kings, on one of
your last pages. It is an excellent
article and must do good. We hope
“Young Siam” may be “set a think-
ing” as well as “reading.” And we
have no doubt the author of First and
Second Kings, whoever it may be,
will do the whole subject justice in
due time; but as we happen to have
a thought on the same subject, and
as we live in too fast an age to wait
on other people to pen our thoughts,
so we may as well scribble them down
ourselves for the benefit of “all whom
it may concern.” Well, our idea is
this—-In this thing of Education, we
do verily believe that “Old Siam,”
“Young Siam,” Missionaries and all
have gotten hold of it at the wrong
end altogether. Some one says, “give
me the first ten years of a child’s life
and after that do what you please with
him.” Now in all ordinary cases, in
this country as in every other who,
has the first ten years of every child’s
life time? The mother, to a very
great extent. Then we would say, by
all means train the mothers. If either
sex must be neglected let it be the
male sex, and let those who are to be
the future mothers in Siam be edu-
cated. Give them good schools where
they will be trained to *Industry,*
*Cleanliness, Pure morality, and True*
*religion,* and let these schools be made
pleasant, cheerful and honorable homes
where they can live and learn and
work, and there let them be *trained,*
not a few months, nor a few years,
but if possible from infancy to old
age. When we see schools of this
kind scattered all over the country
then we will begin to feel that there
is “a step in the right direction.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You say that “the children run
about the streets learning vice and
idleness &c.” Very true. And why
is this? Simply because the mother,
under whose care they are, is herself,
in a great majority of cases, idle and
vicious, a mere slave to the caprices
and passions of her master; her mind
almost a perfect blank, she has no dis-
position, no motive sufficient to induce
her to give any attention to the train-
ing of her children, and the result is,
as might be expected, they grow up
most woefully ignorant of anything
either useful or honorable. And this
is not the case because Siamese wo-
men are naturally or necessarily a
stupid and lazy kind of beings. We
speak what we do know, when we say
that where they have an opportunity
of learning, they will compare favora-
bly with females of other countries in
reading as well as various kinds of
plain and fancy work. Neither is it
because there is not plenty of suitable
work to employ every female in the
country. Why not manufacture the
silk, cotton, and hemp of the country
here, rather than sell the raw material
at half price and send it elsewhere to
be made into cloth? And why are
we, in this city, compelled to pay Chi-
namen tailors and mantua-makers, two
or three prices for what the Siamese
would do at reasonable rates if they
only knew how to do it? Just be-
cause the weight of custom, for cen-
turies past, is crushing this people
down, and no one takes them by the
hand and helps them to throw it off.
This pressure must be removed, and
woman here must be taught that she
is something more than a mere thing,
and that her rice and betel is not her
whole object in life. She must be
taught that she can learn to read, and
learn to think, and learn to train her
children for a life of usefulness and
happiness. But this is a great work,
and how can it be done? The Gov-
ernment can do it, and may we not
hope that ere long it will do something
in this direction.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“The King is the Father of his
people” and has an interest in their
welfare and happiness, and what you
say in his praise is justly his due; but
this he is doing for his sons—he has
daughters too, and as a tender loving
father he must give them a share in
that rich inheritance—a good education
—not simply an education of the mind,
but an education physical, mental, and
moral.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Several generations will probably
pass away before woman in Siam will
find her proper place beside her broth-
er and husband—his equal and com-
panion in all things—still the time
has certainly come when something
decided and energetic should be un-
dertaken to elevate her position in so-
ciety. “Show me woman’s place in
society, and I will show you that na-
tion’s place in civilization.{{< /news/text >}}

PRA CHAUM KLAU.
CHAPTER X.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the king received the crown
he promised to protect Buddhism.
The more's the pity—-Buddhism is
the great millstone, that is dragging
down the whole nation. It is a spell
upon them, which forbids their rising
up as a strong and great nation. They
must be puny as a necessity, while
they cling to a false religion and bow
down to false gods. The very reli-
gion dwarfs them. How can they,
while they worship a mere mortal like
themselves, have a grasping, expan-
ding, comprehending influence, that
includes all time and all races. It is
only pure Christianity, the religion
that reveals the ever-living, ever-pre-
sent, all-powerful Jehovah, which forms
the basis for expansive thoughts and
expansive enterprises.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have only to glance at history
to prove this assertion. All, that have
found their impetus from any other
source, have been selfish, grasping, and
oppressive. If they have cherished
any virtue, it has been with the spirit
of the stern old Roman, who could
plunge the dagger into the heart of a
daughter to save her from a tyrants
will, or that of a beautiful Lucretia
who could murder herself to wipe out
the plague spot of sin. The very acts
are commentaries on the times, mur-
der was a little thing. Tyranny stalk-
ed abroad unabashed. Purity was
cherished for the Roman women, but
the nobility knew no law but the gra-
tification of their own whims. It is
the old story over again. Unbridled
selfishness in the great. The strong
oppressing the weak.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}God did not make one law for man
and another for woman. They are
both subjects of the same law and
held accountable at the same tribunal.
And no nation will be really good, till
the axe is laid at the root of the tree,
and the great become good and pro-
tect the weak. Shall a man covet
what is true and good and pure, and
shall a woman, with finer sensibilities
naturally, have no care for the kind
of character she takes to her heart and
lives to serve! Out upon the princi-
ple, that man may be a libertine and
still smile, and smile and be respected.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the light of all other religions
and all other codes of morals, christi-
anity is most beautifully complete and
excellent. That it emanated from in-
finite wisdom, breathes on its every
page. The thoughts even must be
pure, and high and low, rich and poor,
weak and strong, obey the supreme
will, and obey alike.—-God being mer-
ciful to those who most need commis-
eration. The law of pure Christianity
is love. Love God first and thy fel-
low men as thyself. Revenge is Sata-
nic—-Forgiveness Godlike—-”Neither
do I condemn you go and sin no more.”
So says perfect love. Do as God com-
mands and you must seek the good
of all men every where. Their spiri-
tual, intellectual and physical good, and
those who have followed the bible
must nearly as their law have been
most expansively benevolent, most
universally useful, and highest in the
scale of being. This assertion cannot
be disproved.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}John Wickliff, Martin Luther, and
the pilgrims of Plymouth rock, struck
the same leading notes. The bible
in the hand of every man as the law
of his life, and education for every
man, to help him to grasp his duties, and
do them well. These men gave type
to the nations where they lived, and
influence, and as the result, they have
secured for their people a higher
standpoint and more wonderful results
than antiquity ever know or the most
boastful of other nations ever dream-
ed of.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Greece and Rome have been land-
ed for their greatness and their accom-
plishments, but selfishness was their
impetus, and oppression their handi-
work. Their riches were the riches
of the few and the degradation of the
masses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the early history of Greece, dis-
cipline of the young was greatly insis-
ted upon. But to cheat adroitly was
taught as among the first virtues and
almost necessarily so, as it was the
purpose of the nation to rear a nation
of warriors and war thrives by success-
ful stratagem. They had no principles
to preserve their country in peace and
prosperity. Deterioration is necessa-
rily the result of aggressive war. The
seeds of degradation are in the very
result of aggression, and degradation
followed in Greece and proved her ruin.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rome is the same tale over again,
either as it was while paganism reign-
ed or after it had adopted impure
christianity. During the reign of im-
pure christianity, the masses were
left degraded, that they might blindly
follow the will of those who ruled over
them. It matters little whether a po-
litical ruler or a pope leads blindly an
ignorant multitude.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Christianity, as taught by the un-
adulterated Word, allows no one to be
great except by great service. And
he that would be greatest must be ser-
vant of all. The king is but the great-
est public servant who must live and
think and act not for the best good of the
people. The good of the people is the
“Summum bonum” and the people
should be taught to give cheerfully and
liberally for value received. The king
and his officials give protection and
service, and a servant is worthy of
his hire.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With these principles carried out a
nation must inevitably thrive. It is a
system linked by indissoluble cords,
binding all classes together and mak-
ing the interests of all classes mutual-
ly beneficial. Onward and upward
must be the progress of these princi-
ples till the perfect day. They are
worthy to have universal sway, and
God's word has gone forth which
knows no hindrance. “The kingdoms
of this world shall become the king-
doms of our Lord.” Siam will become
a christian country, and Siamese kings
protect christianity. The only prob-
lem unsolved is, when shall these
things be? Who shall have the plea-
sure of seeing the work of God
prosper!{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The day for renewing the oath of
allegiance to the king of Siam was on
Sunday the 7th inst. All Siamese
princes, lords, nobles, petty magistrates
in and about the city, had then to go

{{< news/text >}}ROBBERY.—-On the night of the 6th
instant, the store of Messrs A. Ey-
moud, D. Henry & Co. was broken op-

stolen from it, consisting of gold and
gilded watches, gold watch chains,
keys, finger rings, lockets, gilt and sil-
ver spoons, and forks, tobacco boxes,
German silver spoons and forks, spect-
acles, broaches etc. We are glad to
be able to report that the thief was
arrested on the 9th inst. and much of
the stolen property secured. Our in-
formants say that the transgressor was
formerly a favored Siamese servant in
the family of His Excellency the late
Phya Sooriwong-Montree—that he
confessed his guilt at once, and has
been severely punished by castigation.
What more is to be done to him we
are not informed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}ASSAULT AND BATTERY.-—At this
late date we have first heard of a case
of Assault and Battery which is said
to have occurred more than 10 days
since on the Charonkroong street (the
new road) in the rear of the American
Consulate. It appears that one of
the Boat-servants of the Am. Consul
on going out to the street near the
Consulate, was assailed by a Chinese
ruffian who thrust a fish spear of three
prongs into his side, making a severe
wound. The Constable, or Jailor of
the Consulate, came immediately to
his rescue and was himself wounded
with a fish spear weilded by another
Chinaman connected with the same
gang, all of whom were interested in
a gambling establishment near by. Our
informant says, that J. M. Hood Esqr.
Am. Consul came out quickly and
caused three of the gang to be arrest-
ed, and that the trial of the case is
now pending in the International
court.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}MAN SHOOTING.—-Another very fear-
ful case of quarrelling, we are sorry to
report, occurred on the evening of the
7th inst, between two Europeans on
the same notorious street Charon
Kroong in the rear of the French
Consulate. The persons engaged in
it were Mr.Cordeiro Clerk, a Portuguese
and Capt. Schmidt a Bremen. All
reports appear to agree that there had
been a quarrel between them of some
days standing about a small sum of
money, less than two dollars, which
Mr. Cordiero insisted was his due but
which Captain Schmidt denied, and that
several sharp altercations had been
between them before that evening.
One class of reporters say, that Capt
S., in passing Mr. Cordeiro's house
that evening, was addressed with
abusive language by the latter, and
that Captain Schmidt answered it
by a fling of his cane into the window
where Mr. Cordiero was sitting, upon
which the latter took up his revolver
and discharged three shots at
Captain Schmidt which lodged two
balls in his thigh. Another report is
that Capt. Schmidt in the heat of his
anger made an effort to burst the door
into Mr. Cordiero's room, but failing,
went out before the house and abused
the latter with vile language, and that
this was the proximate cause of his
shooting Capt. Schmidt. From our
long acquaintance with Mr. Cordiero
we could scarcely have dreamed that
he would ever, except in sheer self-de
fence, in imminent danger, have ventured
to use his revolver as he did. But
there is no telling what a man may
not be tempted to do under strong
provocation in an unguarded moment.
We have no knowledge of the charac-
ter of Captain Schmidt. We under-
stand that Mr. Cordeiro has been ar-
rested by order of the Portuguese
consul and has confessed that he did
the deed.{{< /news/text >}}

Extract from a Sermon.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
By H. W. BEECHER.
Preached from 1st Cor. 7. 29, 30.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Shall we then mourn? What is depart-
ing? What is dying? What is death? Is
there any place where we need to stand
more than by the side of the grave? And
ought we not to learn, looking upon the
sepulcher, to say, "Thou holdest only the
physical body," and to mourn as though we
mourned not; and, looking upon death to
say, "Thou, death, art thyself dead?" For
is not dying as much a part of God's
mercy as being born? When the apple-
tree blossoms you laugh, and you do not
cry when you pick the apple; but when
man blossoms, man laughs; and then,
when God picks the fruit, he cries. Fool
that understands so little! When will you
recognize that which constitutes your
highest good? Glorious is the hour in
which God says, "Come up hither;" and
yet you look upon that hour with fear
and dread.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Long before winter would let me plant
out of doors, I planted under glass, and
depended upon artificial heat, and waited
for the time when I might remove my early
plants. And, as soon as I dared, I set them
in the open air in some sheltered noak
where the frosts should not touch them.
But now, in these June days, I have
taken them into the broad, exposed gar-
den, and put them where they are to
stand and blossom: and they did not
weep when I put them there.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now God has raised us under glass,
and nurtured us there, that we might bear
transplanting in another and better sphere;
and when he comes, and takes us, and
plants us out in his open garden, is that
the time for us to cry? Beloved, ye are
the sons of God; and when the bell
strikes, and the angel, hearing the sweet
sound, flies swiftly to call you to your
sonship and coronation, is that the time
for you to cry? Beloved, it doth not yet
appear what ye are to be; and yet are ye
so pure and noble and true that men can-
not bear your going from them? And are
you lost because all the fragmentary
developments of your being are taken into
that higher sphere where they are more,
not less?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why, your child is not your child till
you have lost him. That which you can
put your arms about is that which you
cannot afford to love. No bird cries
when the shell is broken and the birdling
comes forth; or when, a little later, it
leaves the nest and wings its way through
the air. Only mothers do that when their
children, released from earth, fly away
to a better world. And yet, only are they
worthy of immortal love when they escape
from the clog of this mortal state.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now, let us thank God, not that men
die, but that they live. So far as it pleases
God to devolope and endow them here,
let us be glad; but when they go to live
in a better realm, let us take the higher
view, and say, "Thank God that they
have gone where they shall be perfect;
that they have blossomed, and are bear-
ing fruit." Is not this the more Christian
way?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Ah, brethren! we are not Christians
about dying. Every man is taught to go
to heaven through the prison of death.
Everybody feels that to sicken and die is
to go into Egypt, and into the wilderness.
We are apt to think of sickness and dying
as so many horrible, gloomy stages in our
progress toward the future. But dying
is a process as simple as the parting of
the stem from the bough; or as the swing-
ing of the door that lets one in from the
wintry blast outside to the pleasant home
inside. It is not hard to die. It is harder
a thousand times to live. To die is to be
a man. To live is only to try to be one.
To live is to see God through a glass
darkly. To die is to see him face to face.
To live is to live in the ore. To die is to
be smelted and come out pure gold. To
die is to be in March or November. To
live is to find midsummer, where there is
perfect harmony and perfect beauty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let us not mourn, then, as other men.
Let us mourn as though we mourned not.
Let us rejoice as though we rejoiced not.
Let us work as though we worked not.
Let us love as though we loved not. Let
us feel that the life that is above is the
only thing that is worthy of our thought
and striving. Living for God, for glory.
and for immortality—-that is life enough.{{< /news/text >}}

A Queer Robbery.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Boston TRANSCRIPT tells of a
novel instance of robbery in that enter-
prising town :—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A few evenings since, as a young gen-
tleman was walking on the Common, he
came in contact with a person going in
another direction. Both begged pardon
and passed on. A moment after it oc-
curred to our hero that there might be
something wrong, and he instinctively
put his hand to his watch pocket and
found that his repeater was gone. Turn-
ing round, he saw the person whom he
had suddenly met walking at a leisurely
pace, a short distance from him. Grasp-
ing his revolver (purchased in garrotting
times) he ran toward the robber, came
up to him, drew his pistol and placed it
in uncomfortable contact with his head,
and, in language more forcible than
elegant, demanded his gold hunter, as-
suring him that, should he hesitate an in-
stant, he should pull the trigger and
cause a miscellaneous scattering of his
brains thereabouts. The supposed robber
unhesitatingly took out a watch, gave it
to his dangerous opponent, and got out
of his way as quickly as possible. With
infinite satisfaction and thankfulness the
young gentleman put the watch into his
pocket, and in a fervor of excitement at
his adventure walked home. On his arrival
there his mother noticed the excitement
which he was under, and asked him the
reason of it, whereupon he narrated to
her the circumstances of the robbery, and
recovery of his watch. “Why,” said she,
“your watch is in your room, where you
left it after changing your clothes before
you went out!” The young man was
dumbfounded, took out the watch from
his pocket with a spasmodic twitch, and
on beholding it became still more excited,
for it was not his! He went to his room
and found his own watch where he had
left it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He looked into the glass and saw a
highway robber. Visions of policemen,
handcuffs, Police Court, Superior Cri-
minal Court, Judge Russell, a light
sentence in the State prison for the first
offence, &c., crowded into his imagination
in uncomfortable and regular order. As
soon as possible, however, he advertised
his ill-gotten watch, took other measures,
hoping to live to ask the pardon of his
victim, whom he unintentionally robbed,
but at last accounts nothing had been
heard of him, so that he fears he may be
compelled to keep the watch as a trophy
of a mutual fright.—-Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}BED BUGS—-If any of your readers
need a sure remedy for bed-bugs, they
can have mine, and cleanse the house of
this troublesome vermin, with very little
expense. They have only to wash with
salt and water, filling the cracks where
they frequent with salt, and you may
look in vain for them. Salt seems inim-
ical to bed-bugs, and they will not trail
through it. I think it preferable to ALL
“ointments,” and the buyer requires no
certificate as to its genuineness.{{< /news/text >}}

The Rising young Statesman.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This is the name—George Joachim
Goschen—-of the rising young statesman
of England, the report being generally
credited that Earl Russell has invited
him to a seat in the Cabinet. He is but
thirty-four years of age, which makes
his brilliant promotion quite exceptional
in England, although William Pitt was
Prime Minister at the age of twenty-
four. But that was at a time when poli-
tical life was not settled in England as it
is now, and Mr. Pitt was the son of the
most popular man in the kingdom. Mr.
Goschen, though born in England, is of
German descent, and his grandfather
kept a book-stall at Leipsic Fair. He
graduated with high honors at Oxford,
and went into the banking business in
London, where he has made a fortune,
besides acting as a Director of the Bank
of England, and writing an excellent
treatise on political economy. Mr. Gos-
chen entered Parliament in 1863 as mem-
ber from the city of London, and at the
last election he was returned at the head
of the poll. He won high rank among
the best Parliamentary debaters, and was
one of Mr. Gladstone’s confidential ad-
visers. Whether he can sustain the high
promises of his future public career, re-
mains to be seen, the best guaranty of
such a result being afforded in the solid
and well merited honors he has achieved
thus far. He could hardly have done
better if he had grown up under our
own liberal institutions. This reminds us
to say that Mr. Goschen has been a true
friend of our country. He refused to
have anything to do with the confederate
loan; and in his general Parliamentary
career has stood with much advanced
Liberals as Mr. Bright and Mr. Foster,
the former of whom it is said to have
heartily recommended his elevation to
the Cabinet.—-Pacific.{{< /news/text >}}

Tobacco and Madness.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}If anything can restrain our young
men from the pernicious habit of tobac-
co smoking and chewing, it may be in
such warnings as are contained in the re-
ports of their terrible results in France :{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From 1812 to 1832, the tobacco tax in
France produced 28,000,000 francs, and
the lunatic asylums contained 8,000
patients. The tobacco revenue has now
reached 180,000,000, while there are 44,
000 paralytic and lunatic patients in the
hospitals ; showing that the increase of
lunacy has kept pace with the increase of
the revenue of tobacco. These statistics,
presented by M. Jolly to the Academy
of Science, in connection with the closing
words of his speech, containing a fright-
ful warning to those forming the perni-
cious habit of smoking, now increasing
so rapidly : "The immoderate use of to-
bacco, and more especially of the pipe,
produce a weakness of the brain and in
the spinal marrow, which causes mad-
ness."—-PACIFIC.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}VATTEL, the great veterinary of the
continent, states that the rate of pulsa-
tion of different domestic animals of the

pulsations per minute ; an ox or cow, 25
to 42 ; a sheep, 72 to 79 ; the ass, 48 to
54 ; the goat, 72 to 76 ; the dog, 90 to

{{< news/text >}}SPIRITUALISM EXPOSED.—Sothern, the
actor, having been called a spiritualist,
pronounces the allegation unfounded.
He says that he belonged to a party of
twelve professional gentlemen formed
for the purpose of a thorough, practical,
and exhaustive investigation of the
phenomena of “spiritualism.” They were
quite ready for either result-—to believe
it if it were true ; to reject it if found
false. For more than two years they had
weekly meetings. At length by practice,
they succeeded in producing all the won-
derful “manifestations” of the profes-
sional “media,” but other effects still
more startling. They got signatures of
Shakspeare, Garrick, and other celeb-
rated personages ; produced spirit hands
and forms ; and made people float in the
air or rather made spectators believe so.
Professional mediums witnessed their
feats and avowed their superior power
over the “spirits.” But the spirits had
nothing to do with the phenomena. They
were accomplished by other means.—-

The Tyranny of Fashion.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We all know there is no more imperious
despot than fashion. In our own country,
a century ago, the heads of little boys of
four were shaved, and they were made to
wear wigs like their fathers. The highest
authorities contended that wigs were much
cleaner than the natural hair. Within the
remembrance of many persons now living,
the wearing of a beard was considered as
not only slovenly, but as a positive ruffi-
anism. No man was looked upon with
favor until he had removed every vestige
of the hair which should have protected
his throat. The great change that has oc-
curred in this respect is obvious to all.
We may look for equal modifications in
the present absurd inconvenient dress
worn by the women of the present day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are by no means advocates of Bloom-
erism. Neither would we counsel any lady
to attempt to put at defiance the customs
of the day. One can avoid foolish extremes
without running into their opposites and
becoming a public laughing stock. Our
fashionable ladies would do well to re-
member that the wearing of trousers is no
more foolish—perhaps much less so—than
trailing a yard of costly silk or satin
through the mud and filth of the streets.
A skirt, of moderate dimensions, is at least
no more immodest than a hoop distended
over fifteen or twenty feet in circumfor-
ence, every movement of which reveals
those limbs which it is thought very inde-
cent for the Bloomers to cover with pan-
taloons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}American women, instead of copying
the extravagancies of Parisian prostitutes,
would do well to adopt some simple, easy,
and convenient mode of dress. It need not
be strikingly at variance with what they
have always worn, yet it should be free
from absurdities of length, breadth and
adornment. They would thus save money,
add to their charms, increase the esteem
of the men, and what is better, have more
self-respect.—-CIN. GAZETTE.{{< /news/text >}}

Italy.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Kingdom of Italy has an area of
98,784 English square miles, with a po-
pulation, according to the last census,
taken in the spring of 1864, of 21,703,-
710 souls, being on an average 220 in-
habitants to the square mile, a figure
higher than that of France and Germany,
but lower than that of England. There
has been in some of the Provinces a rapid
increase of population of late years; but
the increase of wealth has been much
more rapid within the last century than
the increase of population. The great
mass of the people are devoted to agri-
cultural pursuits, and the town popula-
tion is comparatively small. It has a
seafaring population of 158,692 individ-
uals, nearly all of whom are liable to the
maritime conscription. The military or-
ganization of the Kingdom is based on
conscription, and the standing army con-
sists of more than 200,000 men on a
peace footing, and more than 400,000 on
a war establishment. The navy of the
Kingdom consisted in 1865 of 98 steam-
ers of 20,760 horse power, with 2,160
guns, and 17 sailing vessels with 279
guns; altogether, 115 men of war with
2,439 guns. Italy has a public debt of
nearly eight hundred millions of dollars.
The expenditure is largely in excess of
the annual revenue. The reigning Sov-
ereign, Victor Emanuel II., was born
March 14, 1820, and is the eldest son of
King Charles Albert of Sardinia, and the
Archduchess Theresa of Austria. He
succeeded to the throne on the abdication
of his father, March 23, 1849, and was
proclaimed King of Italy by vote of the
Italian Parliament, March 17, 1861.{{< /news/text >}}

The German Confederation.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The German Confederation was organ-
ized, in 1815, upon the ruins of the Ger-
man Empire which had been dissolved in
1806. The object of the Confederacy,
according to the first article of the Fed-
eral Constitution, is "the preservation of
the internal and external security of Ger-
many, and the independence and invio-
lability of the various German States."
The organ and representative of the Con-
federation is the Federal Diet, consisting
of Plenipotentiaries of the several Ger-
man States, and permanently located in
the free city of Frankfort. The admin-
istrative Government of the Federal Diet
is constituted in two forms: 1st. As a
GENERAL ASSEMBLY or PLENUM, in which
every member of the Confederation has
at least one vote, and the larger States
have two, three or four votes each; and
second, the Minor council, or Committee
of Confederation, in which the eleven
largest States cast one vote each, while
six votes are given to the smaller States,
a number of them combined having a
joint vote. The Presidency is perman-
ently vested in Austria. The General
Assembly decides on war and peace, on
the admission of new members, on any
changes in the fundamental laws or or-
ganic institutions; but in all other cases
the Minor Council is competent to act
both as legislative and executive.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the time of its establishment the
Confederacy embraced 39 members, but
of these four (Saxe-Gotha, Anhalt-Bern-
berg, Anhalt-Koethen and Hesse-Hom-
burg,) have become extinct, and two,
(Hohenzollern-Hechingen, and Hohen-
zollern-Sigmaringen) have been incor-
porated with Prussia, leaving, at present,
33 sovereign States. They have together
an area of 242,867 square miles, and, in
1864, a population of 46,000,000 people,
exceeding the aggregate population of
British America, the United States, Mex-
ico, and Central America, and being in
Europe inferior to that of no country
except Russia. The Federal army num-
bers about 700,000.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Austria and Prussia belong, with only
a part of their several dominions, to this
Confederation; Austria with a population
of 12,802,944, Prussia with a population
of 14,714,024. Prussia, therefore, and
not Austria, is in point of population the
first German State, and this priority is
still more prominent if we take into ac-
count the provinces of both powers not
belonging to this Confederation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Deducting the population of the two
great German powers, population is left
for the other States of about 19,000,000,
with a Federal Army of about 300,000.
As the record of the votes of the Federal
Diet during the last year shows the great
majority of the minor States side with, or
at least lean towards Austria, and it is
still commonly believed, that soon after
an outbreak of war between Austria and
Prussia, the Diet will declare a Federal
war against Prussia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All parties in Germany, Austria, Prus-
sia, the Minor Governments, and all the
political parties among the people, are in
favor of establishing a Central National
Parliament, as a step toward the ultimate
establishment of one German Empire.
This point is, therefore, likely to be one
of the results of the impending war.{{< /news/text >}}

State of Mandalay before the
Outbreak.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}While the struggle for the throne is
still pending, it may not be uninteresting
to our readers, to give the ideas of one
of the European residents there, as ex-
pressed two months before the outburst.
The following are extracts from a pri-
vate letter, dated Mandalay the 6th of
June, which we have been favored with
permission to place before the public,
but we need scarcely say, that we are in
no wise responsible for the opinions
therein expressed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"You will, I know, be interested to
hear how I find the country on my re-
turn to it. First it is horribly hot, and
second it is full of lies. Probably the
last fact accounts for the first, for if
there be such a thing as paternal affec-
tion, the Father of lies must have his
home close to so many children. But
seriously, it strikes me now more than
ever it did before, how utterly hollow
and false is every thing here.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Generally, the Revenue and Foreign
policy question necessarily dovetail into
each other. The Burmese government is
mortally afraid of British traders, knows
it dare not forbid them trading and can-
not do without the revenue, which the
trade gives them. They have at last
contrived a plan to meet the difficulty.
It is this. Keep out the British mer-
chant, at the same time that he is warm-
ly invited, by putting all the trade into
the hands of Burmese subjects, leaving
nothing for him to trade in, and make
the monopolists pay largely for their
privileges. If the British merchant wants
the goods, offer them to him at the Ran-
goon prices. To be monopolists are
"men of straw," simply the king's pup-
pets. There is not a large product of
any kind which is not now monopolized,
or being monopolized. The country
people suffer fearfully from this system.
They are in some cases forbidden to sell
to foreigners, in others they are simply
made to understand, that should they
sell, they will get well punished. They
are thus compelled to sell below the real
value, and cultivation is discouraged and
the peasantry get away, if they can man-
age it, to British territory. But this is
not always easy with a wife and children,
especially if the man has a house and
land. The corruption and oppression is
just in proportion to the distance from
British influence and British ground.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Perhaps you have heard of Burman
earth oil or petroleum. The wells are
old steady ones, not like the Yankee
spouts of thousands of gallons per mi-
nute. The king has leased the product
to two puppet bankers or "thateys," for
a sum that makes it cost £1 to these
thateys, the difference amounting to for-
ty thousand pounds a year which H. M.
gets from his own and our Burmese sub-
jects, who use it for lighting.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"With tea, cotton and other products
the same system is pursued. The treaty
is in fact commercially a nullity. British
subjects are by it guaranteed free leave
to buy and export everything. Practi-
cally they can get nothing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"EXPENDITURE. His majesty has some
seventy wives, and as many sons and
daughters. The Crown Prince has a fa-
mily of similar proportions. Princes and
Princesses must have diamonds and fine
clothes. I need not tell you that these
cost money. The King and Crown
Prince's private expenses including de-
pendent's remuneration and so forth can-
not be less than two thirds of the whole
revenue. Of the remaining third a great
portion goes to feed, encourage, and
lodge in golden monasteries, the most
consistent, the most harmless and laziest
set of monks that ever fattened on an
oppressed people. Where there is so
little encouragement to be a "man," it is
no wonder, that so many thousands be-
come priests.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Among the King's private expendi-
ture is included the cost of immense
canals, mud walls, and summer palaces,
all of them suggestive of the play of a
mere child, regardless of mere cost, aim-
ing neither at utility nor luxury. The
whole thing especially, when the minis-
ters talk of these improvements, forces
upon one the exclamation, what a fool
the Ruler must be, and how much big-
ger fools must his unresisting subjects be.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"With such a Court, it is natural that
all the provincial offices should be filled
by those, who can pay best for them
that is by the men, who engage to press
the peasantry most effectually.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"With all this, the King is not a bad
man. On the contrary, at the expense of
his people's labour and goods, he is a
massing to himself and immense amount
of merit for the next world. To this end
are his erections of pagodas and monas-
teries, distribution of food to the priests,
frequent repetition of most excellent
scriptures, and what is really praise wor-
thy his endeavour to prevent the taking
of life. But even in this last point, the
praise is only partial, for his regard fre-
quently makes justice miscarry, and every
now and then takes the most objectiona-
ble form of depriving foreigners of ani-
mal food.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"According to the modern Buddhist
idea, the crime of taking the life of a
good man, a criminal, and a fowl only
varies in degrees not in kind. Gautama
the incarnate Buddh was not so silly, and
in fact died from a stomach ache caused
by eating pork. There, by the bye, he
was wrong for pork is quite unfit for
human food in a tropical and perhaps in
all climates. The character of the King
shows a strange mixture of benevolence,
and selfishness, of ignoble greed, and ex-
travagant expenditure.-—RANGOON TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Latest Intolligonoe from
Mandalay.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have to tender our thanks to
Moolah Esmail, for the following tele-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}gram received the evening before last
from Thayetmyo.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Letter from Minlah. King sent or-
ders to take duties as before. King's
troops under Atween Woon Kosoh have
come to Salin. "Yaynansykia is at
Paghan. Captain Rielly and Engineer
have deserted her and gone to Mandalay
King's people are trying to catch the
Steamer and Rebel princes. The Mag-
way Myothoogyee has escaped and come
down here. I hear that all are well at
Mandalay."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This is a most intelligible and a most
satisfactory telegram. There can be no
question, that in a few 'days more the
two rebel Princes will be caught and
dealt with according to the laws, both of
God and Man. If they come into Brit-
ish territory, they stand no chance of es-
cape. We shall simply regard them as
Murderers, who are flying from justice.
Political refugees we are bound in honor
always to protect, but our Government
has never yet thrown its protection a-
round murderers. They will be held
under surveillance by our police until a
request is made for them by the King.
We trust they may remain in their own
territory, where they will soon fall into
the hands of the king's troops who have
been sent after them."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is earnestly hoped, that these trou-
bles in upper Burmah may result in the
Burmese Government entering into pro-
per Treaty relations with our Govern-
ment. Indeed, that they would recog-
nize the importance of having a British
officer of rank as Resident, with a per-
sonal Assistant and establishment, to
whose opinion and judgment, the Court
of Burmah should be bound to give heed
in matters pertaining to the administra-
tion of the country, and especially in all
subjects of trade, and in their relations
and arrangements with foreign states and
Governments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On his visit to the Burmese capital,
during next month, perhaps for it must
be remembered that the plan has never
been abandoned His Honor the Chief,
Commissioner will posses the rare and
felicitous opportunity of meeting the
King when just recovering from the
heavy affliction to which he has been sub-
jected in the death of the Royal Brother
and his three eldest sons. The instability
of human affairs will be apparent to both
his majesty and the whole Court.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Colonel Phayre's great experience of
Burmah, to which we have so often allu-
ded, his feelings of regard for the King,
and sympathy for the people, and his
personal statesmanship and tact as a dip-
lomatist, will now find ample scope in
effecting needful reforms in the Burmese
government. It will be impossible for
the King to hold out any longer against
good advice tendered to him, and especi-
ally at the present junctare of public
affairs in his reign. We should almost
venture to predict, that His Majesty
would be willing to adopt every recom-
mendation which the Chief Commissioner
may deem it necessary to make. In this
aspect of the case there is a peculiar
aptness and force given to the following
lines taken from the writings of the
Poet Cowper."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent2 >}}God moves in a mysterious way,

{{< news/indent3 >}}His wonders to perform,

{{< news/indent2 >}}He plants his footsteps in the sea,

{{< news/indent3 >}}And rides upon the storm.
