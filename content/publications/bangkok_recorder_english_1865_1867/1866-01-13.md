Life and Speeches of Andrew
Johnson.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
By Little, Brown & Co.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}No man, raised to so important a
post as President Johnson's, in such a
critical hour, can be otherwise than
an object of especial consideration.
In his hands have been placed, by the
providence of God, the immediate
future of this republic. We say "im-
mediate," because no man can perman-
ently thwart or destroy the announced
decrees of God. He may stay their
progress; he may, if supported by wick-
ed subjects, destroy their advocates;
but through God's chastising hand
we must receive the blessings at last
that we have refused to the call of his
spirit, working in our corrupted con-
sciences and rebellious hearts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}President Johnson, therefore, is an
instrument of God's, if he will work
with him; if not, he will be rejected
of him, and the nation with him be re-
jected, until they shall repent and elect
rulers that will rule in righteousness.
Called to the throne of the popular
will by a fearful calamity, we may not
perhaps expect properly of him all
that we should have demanded of
one who had been selected as our
standard-bearer. The chair it was
intended that he should fill is of
slight importance in itself. In that he
would have served his country un-
doubtedly with sufficient ability; the
chair to which he is elevated is of un-
speakable importance, and how he
shall carry himself in his high estate
is yet unknown fully, even to himself.
His speeches and past life are our chief
guarantees; for men in office never
radically diverge from the character
which their former career has disclosed.
Lincoln was the same in the log but
that he was in Washington. Seward
has pursued the same career as Secre-
tary that he did as senator; Sumner
as a statesman that he did as an orator.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What does this life teach us that
we may look for in the man? He is a
positive man. From the beginning he
has been willing to take the respon-
sibility. He sees clearly what he sees
at all, and is very square and prompt
in his statement of his views. Through-
out this volume are evidences of this
characteristic. He is for the Union.
No hint in his speeches is there of
wavering in this attachment. From
the first rising of this cloud, when no
bigger than a man's hand, he detected
and denounced its mischievous con-
tents. His speeches upon this theme
are by far his ablest. In them burns
the whole fury of his soul. No speaker
of the winter of '61 was so vehement, so
steady, so inspiring in this sentiment
as he. Principle weakened seeming-
ly the seal of the Republican—for
Union then meant, apparently, slavery;
policy sapped the strength of the
Northern Democrat—for Union meant
coercion, and from that he shrank;
while the defiant South was of one
heart, and soul, and mind, and strength
against the national bond. Among
them all he stood faithful to the single
idea of Union. He declared it could
not, as well as should not, be destroyed;
and in words of fire blazed upon its
enemies. True, he disregarded higher
principles, he even denounced them,
because they seemed to stand in the
way of the Union. But he would em-
brace them if they subserved this end,
as he would cast away his favorite in-
stitution of slavery if it resisted it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He is a frank man. Like most
positive men, he is open. One sees
clearly what he means. There is no
subterfuge about him. What he wants
done, he will fight to do—openly,
yet fairly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These are his chief traits; how do
they adapt him to the place and hour?
The test of the Union is past. It was
past before he came to the chair of state.
Whatever troubles the South may
cause, they will never threaten disunion
again. Could they put Jeff. Davis
into the presidency of the republic, he
would have unlearned that word.
What is the duty? The democratizing
of the nation. The Union is preser-
ved; democracy is yet unaccomplished.
Gov. Perry declares that this is a
white man's government. With a
majority of colored men in his state,
to a body of secessionists, some of
whom are yet unpardoned, he has the
impudence to make this declaration.
It is the inaugural word of the new
conflict. How will it be met by the
President? Hints in his later speeches
are all that afford us light in this
volume. Did they say this white
man's government shall stand in spite
of the Union, we should know where
to find him; but they are too crafty to
openly wage war with him on that
issue.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Is he a true democrat? Will he ad-
vocate the rights of man as man? Or
will Southern prejudice and Northern,
too, alas! beguile him from his stead-
fastness? He stood almost alone for
the Union pure and simple; will he
thus stand for Manhood? Will the
despised tailor grasp the equally but
not more despised barber-brother by
the hand, and place him his equal at
his side? Will the child of honest but
socially contemned parents link his
fame and fortunes with those of equally
honest and hardly less contemned
"trash" of a duskier hue.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The volume gives some favorable
answers to these all important queries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In answer to his nomination for the
Vice-Presidency, at a mass meeting in
Nashville, he said, speaking directly
to the blacks: "I desire that all men
shall have a fair start and an equal
chance in the race of life, and let him
succeed who has the most merit. This,
I think, is a principle of heaven." This
doctrine inevitably involves their citi-
zenship.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again, speaking to them, he declar-
ed "that the hour had come when
worth and merit, without regard to
color, should be the standard by which
to judge the value of a man." —-p. 35.
And again: "Rebellion and slavery
shall, by God's good help, no longer
pollute our state. Loyal men,
whether white or black, shall alone
control her destinies. And when
this strife in which we are all engaged
is passed, I trust, I know, we shall
have a better state of things, and shall
all rejoice that honest labor reaps the
fruit of its own industry, and that
every man has a fair chance in the race
of life." True, these hopeful words
are all found in two serenade speeches,
delivered in the streets of Nashville.
They are not his authorized and of-
ficial statements. That statement
remains to be made. We trust that
he will keep the light he then attain-
ed. If he does, this volume will be
eagerly read by all coming ages, as
the first fruits of a soul that, provident-
ially lifted to the highest earthly seat,
exalted himself far higher than his
place by crushing an ungodly caste,
annihilating a profound and ancient
prejudice, and making democracy,
not a thing of shreds and patches,
of aristocratic exclusion and contempt,
but a true, actual, universal fact. If
he does not, he will subside, as have
the two similarly made Presidents be-
fore him, into powerlessness, ignominy,
and obscurity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}May his coming and immediate
acts make his work immortal.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Cholera.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The late sanitary discussions in Eu-
rope, have called forth some remarks
which may prove both interesting and
valuable to us out here. It seems that
the late visitation of Cholera has been
traced back to Mecca and to the mot-
ley fanatics that gather there from all
parts of the world. We extract from
a long article on the subject in the Dai-
ly Telegraph the following two para-
graphs which give a somewhat startling
picture of the sanitary condition of the
Shrine of the Prophet; and the picture
should interest us not a little when we
reflect that the pestilence may travel
Eastward as well as Westward, and
that though our pilgrims may not car-
ry Cholera hence, as the writer suppo-
ses, they may bring it back here with
them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Our neighbours, the French, have
hit the right nail on the head as re-
gards cholera. What the essential na-
ture of the disease is, neither they,
nor we, nor any of the nations that
suffer from it can yet make out. What
portion of the organism its subtle virus
first attacks, how that virus is propo-
gated, and whether or not there exists
a specific against its fatal incidence,
these are all unsolved problems. But
the local sourse of each visitation is al-
ways open to discovery, and always
well worth searching for, and that is
what the French have very wisely been
investigating, in view of the terrible
mortality which has scourged their
southern cities. Their conclusion, we
do not hesitate to declare, is the right
one. The cholera of 1865, which has
certainly numbered its victims already
by hundreds of thousands, started on
its fatal march along the borders of
the Mediterranean from Mecca. At the
beginning of this year there was, it is
true, a prevalence of the same pest in
parts of India, the Straits, and China;
and the fact tends to confirm the opin-
ion that the scourge co-exists with def-
inite atmospherical conditions, which
may be very general indeed. But Mec-
ca was the point whence the dreadful
disease set out to devastate the West
and South, and Mecca certainly did
not import it from India. In the ear-
lier part of 1865 the concourse of “had-
jis” at the holy Arabian cities was im-
mence. All the caravans were crowded;
the one from Damascus was the largest
that had been known for years; and a
vast influx pressed to Mecca and Me-
dina by the way of the Red Sea and
Jeddah. Cholera broke out among the
pilgrims, and they perished by thou-
sands; the road from the sea to the
shrine was lined with sick and dying,
the Sheikh of Mecca shut himself up in
a khan, but in spite of swallowing un-
limited verses of the Koran written on
leaves and smeared with honey, he
fell a victim; and the caravan started
homeward reduced already by a third.
Egypt is nearest to the Kaaba, and E-
gypt received the plague first from
the dirty fanatics. How it raged there
is well known. Busy Alexandria was
paralysed with terror; Cairo was once
more a “city of plague;” and the Vice-
roy disgusted Europe by bolting in
frantic fear from a visitor who certain-
ly does not care for “hattis” or prin-
ces. Wherever those caravans march-
ed in the return journey they left long
lines of graves; at every halting-place
they marked the spot with a Golgo-
tha. Jaffa took the cholera from them
and Jerusalem; as did Smyrna and Bei-
rut; and just so soon as the ragged, fil-
thy horde arrived in that plain outside
Damascus— where you may see the
tomb of St. George, and the wall from
which St. Paul was lowered—the fright-
ful pestilence appeared in the city.
We doubt, indeed, whether Constanti-
nople, though it took the plague early,
suffered until the richer hadjis had
reached the Golden Horn, and brought
the fell messenger with them. Perhaps
the French commissioners have been
able to ascertain that such was the case;
at all events, we hold their conclusion
an infrangable one, that the visitation
of this year had its source in the horde
of Mussulman devotees at the shrine
of the Prophet. This conclusion has
been formulated and addressed to his
Majesty the Emperor of the French,
under the signatures of the Ministers
M. Drouyn de Lhuys and M. Behic,
with a recommendation that a Diplo-
matic Conference be held "to propose
"practical measures for the better
"organization of the sanitary service
"of the East."{{< /news/text >}}

Russian Railways
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Russians are making a trans-
Caucasian railway, to connect Poti on
the Black sea with Bakou on the Cas-
pian. Several thousand soldiers are en-
gaged on the works. This is part of
the great design of Russia to form a
line of military posts, which shall make
its old frontier and present base invul-
nerable, all along Central Asia from the
Amour province on the east by the
Lake Issyk Kul, the Aral and the Caspian
to the Black Sea. Some time ago the
Russians made overtures to an English
engineer, with the view of inducing
him to survey the country for a railway
from Peshawar to the Caspian. After
studying the subject he declared that
there were no insuperable physical dif-
ficulties, but the expense would be
such as to forbid English capital at-
tempting such a work. The Russians
have now command of the Oxus from
the Sea of Aral to its source in the
Hindoo Koosh, and a fleet of steamers
in both Aral and Caspian. For a time
this will be sufficient for their wants,
but a power that recruits its vast Cau-
casus army with Poles and Cossacks,
and uses its soldiers to make railways,
is not likely to be long without a line
from the Poti and Bakou railway
southeast to its frontier and ours.{{< /news/text >}}

Attack of Pirates
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Report of Siamese Barque "Sen-
ator" Capt. Thomson.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Left Hongkong at 3 A. M. 13th Dec.
1865 bound for Bangkok, light easter-
ly winds, 10 A. M. passed Linting and
steered for the Tytami Channel. Saw
a junk coming from under the Lema
island, which sheered in company with
us, at about one and a half miles dis-
tance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Towards dusk, getting clear of
Tytami Channel, she closed more in
with the ship, it being a light breeze
at the time, the ship going 8 knots.
The junk being the fastest sailer, got
ahead of us about two miles, when she
hauled her foresail aback, apparently to
wait for us. This looked rather sus-
picious.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I then set all possible studding
sails, and keeping away two points, got
the guns loaded. Those on board of
the junks no sooner perceived us keep-
ing away, than they altered their course
too; and followed us again, she gained
fast upon us, and a little after sunset
we could see at least 12 men upon her
deck; where previously there had only
been three in sight.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Seeing them getting stinkpots aloft
and maneuvering so as to keep the
junk always close to us, I watched a
chance to fire a gun at them effectual-
ly, as there would have been no time
to reload, when suddenly they opened
a heavy fire of musketry upon us,
which laid the mate senseless on deck,
with a ball in the pit of his stomach,
and several of the crew were wounded,
which so panic struck the remainder,
as well as the Chinese, that they all de-
serted the deck, some going below
others aloft. During the confusion
the pirates (now numbering about 30
men) had no trouble in boarding us,
and levelling their pieces at those aloft
ordered them to come down.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Seeing myself utterly defenceless,
I got away forward over the bows and
laid hold of one of the bobstays. The
pirates having let go one of the anch-
ors, one of them looked over the bows
to see the cable, and seeing me told
me to come up or he would fire at me.
When I had got on deck again he shew-
ed me all his arms, consisting of a French
patent revolver, polished, cutlass and
a musket, at the same time saying that
every one of the pirates were armed
in the same manner. When he under-
stood that I was the master of the ves-
sel, he threatened again to shoot me.
They then dragged me to the main
hatch, and put two sentinels over me,
keeping me there about two hours,
when they dragged me into the cabin,
where they had turned every thing up-
side down, and devoured every thing
found palatable, every now and then
some one of them demanded where
the money was hidden and threatened
to take my life if I did not tell.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}During this time the mate was ly-
ing in his berth in a pitiful state, when
one of the cowardly rascals fired an-
other bullet into his back.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}During the time they kept me sit-
ting on the main hatch, I could see an-
other junk, but not being allowed to
to rise, I could not observe her move-
ments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the pirates had satisfied
their avarice they prepared to leave,
when the Captain forced me to shew
him all my charts and chronometer,
and point out to him all the principle
ports in the Formosa Channel, which
charts he took with him. About 2 A.
M. Dec. 14th the pirates left me and
steered for the island again.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After mustering the crew, I found
three others more or less wounded.
After heaving up the anchor, which
the pirates had let go, we made sail to
return to Hongkong. At daylight no
land was visible. Noon Dec. 14th
found myself 40 miles South of the As-
ses Ear, when the mate died of his
wounds. Finding it impossible to reach
Hongkong, it blowing strong from the
N. K. I kept away, and shaped a course
for Saigon, to obtain medical assistance
for the rest of the wounded. Dec. 15th
at Noon, on the Macclesfield bank one
of the wounded (a topman) died. The
rest of the crew having recovered, we
proceeded for Bangkok, and arrived
outside the bar without any other mis-
hap at 2 A. M. Dec. 27th 1865.{{< /news/text >}}

Checking Prespiration
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Edward Everett, the finished scholar,
the accomplished diplomatist, the ora-
tor, the salesman, the patriot, became
overheated by testifying in a court room,
on Monday morning, went to Faneuil
Hall, which was cold, sat in a draft of
air until his turn came to speak; "but
my hands and feet were ice, my lungs
on fire. In this condition, I had to go
and spend three hours in the court-
room," he died in less than a week from
this checking of the perspiration. It
was enough to kill any man.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Professor Mitchell, the gallant sol-
dier and the most eloquent astronomi-
cal lecturer that has ever lived, while
in a state of perspiration in yellow
fever, the certain sign of recovery,
left his bed, went into another room,
became chilled in a moment and died
the same night.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If while perspiring, or while some-
thing warmer than usual, from exer-
cise or a heated room, there is a sud-
den exposure in stillness, to a still cold
air, or to a raw damp atmosphere, or
to a draft, whether at an open window
or door, or street corner, an inevitable
result is violent and instantaneous clo-
sing of the pores of the skin, by which
waist and impure matters, which were
making their way out of the system,
are compelled to seek an exit through
some other channel, and break though
some weaker part, not the natural one,
and harm to that part is the result. The
idea is presented by saying that the
cold is settled in that part. To illus-
trate:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A lady was about getting into a small
boat to cross the Delaware; but wishing
first to get an orange at a fruit stand, she
ran up to the bank of the river, and on
her return found herself much heated,
for it was summer; but there was a lit-
tle wind on the water and the clothing
felt cold to her. The next morning she
had a severe cold, which settled on her
lungs, and within a year she died of
consumption.{{< /news/text >}}

Bangkok Recorder.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
January, 13th 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}In commencing our [?] volume
of "The Bangkok Recorder" we desire,
though behind the proper time, to wish
all our patrons and readers a "Happy
New Year," for we cannot forget the
old adage our parents taught us that
"in every good work it is better to be
late than never" and we remember,
too, that it is always accounted new
year until the sun passes the meridian
of the year. As this is our first issue
since the year commenced, we would
most cordially unite with His Majesty
the King of Siam in that most remark-
able prayer of his own peculiar thinking
and wording found in another column
of our paper, for the prosperity of all
of his and our friends in all their
laudable undertakings, and for many
more years of happy life vouchsafed
to them on earth. How unlike a sup-
porter of the Buddhist faith does that
prayer of Siam's king appear! How
clearly does it seem to recognize a
living and Almighty God who loveth
to pour blessings upon those who ask
him for them! How full and benefi-
cent and yet how guarded and dis-
criminating between laudable and un-
laudable pursuits of happiness? Cer-
tainly no one of His Majesty's numer-
ous European and American friends
can, on reading that prayer refrain from
responding to the king by a prayer to
Him who is in truth Almighty and
Eternal that He would be pleased to
impart to His Majesty, a happy new
year and prolong his precious life
many more years of increasing pros-
perity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The new year on which we have so
recently entered is in all probability
to be one crowded with momentous
events. To it a large majority of Bib-
lical scholars and holy men of God of
all ages since the beginning of the
Christian era have looked as being the
one pointed to in the Apocalypse for
the sounding of the 7th trumpet. If
such be in the main a correct view of the
divine prophecy, this year cannot but
be a most eventful one throughout the
world. Be it as it may, we feel it to
be a high privilege to stand on a watch
tower in this heathen city as a "Re-
corder" of passing events. Although
the sheet we hope to issue weekly be
of diminutive size, and our pen, when
compared with most others, not well
skilled in journalizing, yet we think
that we "ought not to despise the day
of small things." And we feel determin-
ed that with all our littleness and un-
skillfulness in this work, to command
respect by diligent scrutiny and truth-
ful and bold reporting. That we shall
not frequently err and sometimes
make grievous mistakes it would be
presumption in us to expect. But by
the help of God our mistakes shall be
clothed with integrity and innocency.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This year has opened upon Siam
with two great events—the one the
inauguration into manhood of the
heir apparent to the throne of the
Prabats-—Prince Chow-fa-Chula-
longkorn.-—The other the demise of
His Majesty Prabat Somdetah Prá Pin
Klou the late 2nd King of Siam on
the morning of the 7th inst. It is to
us a somewhat remarkable coincidence
that only the day after the closing of
the august ceremonies for shaving off
the top knot of the heir apparent, His
Majesty the late 2nd king bade an
everlasting adieu to this life, and thus,
it would seem, at one stroke cut adrift
all further doubts whether the succes-
sion to the throne of the Prabats shall
be in the line of the elder or the
younger of the two illustrious bro-
thers who have so ably ruled the king-
dom in conjunction till the beginning
of this year. We sincerely mourn
the death of His Majesty Prabat
Somdetelt Pra Pin Kiod. It is more
than 20 years since we first had the
honor of becoming acquainted with
him. And being allowed by him to
enjoy the favor of a good degree of
intimacy ever since, we do with much
pleasure testify that we have ever
found him remarkably condescending,
gentlemanly and kind. So much was
he always in love with European
science, manners and customs, that we
have uniformly found it refreshing to
meet him. It was as it were a little
visit out of a heathen city to our own
home in our beloved father-land, to
call on him at his palace and observe
his works in European style, and
every thing the most orderly, tasty,
and neat. During the last year His Ma-
jesty has suffered much from ill health,
and consequently retired mainly from
public life. We regret that we have
but little knowledge of his history
during this period. It is fervently to
be hoped that His Majesty the king
his own elder and beloved brother will
be pleased soon to give the public
some account of it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We learn with great pleasure that
His Majesty the king sent a special
message to one of the Missionary la-
dies requesting her to attend upon his
languishing royal brother a few of the
last days of his life, and that she gladly
complied with the request and doubt-
less 'fulfilled' well the mission thus
devolved upon her.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As in olden times among heathen
nations, the Siamese evince their
mourning for the death of kings by
shaving their heads. This work has
already been commenced on the heads
of the subjects of the late second king
and is expected to exempt neither
male nor female adult belonging to
that division of the kingdom. But
custom excuses all others from the
tonsure sign of mourning. Probably
not less than one fourth of all Siam-
ese subjects belonging to the second
king's division. It is now easy to
ascertain who they are, for "on all
heads is baldness and every beard is
cut off."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We propose in the next issue of our
paper to give a 'particular' account of
the royal festival for the tonsure of
Prince Chowfa Chulalongkorn which
commenced on the 1st and ended on
the 6th inst. Suffice it now to say,
that it was, to nearly all beholders,
natives as well as foreigners, the most
unique and imposing they had ever
seen for such an occasion. Such high
honors it is believed have not been
conferred on any Siamese Prince since
once in 1817 when His Majesty the
present king was similarly honored,
and once in 1821 on the person of the
late second king. None but Princes
born of Queens are allowed to have
such an august parade made for them,
while all must have some.{{< /news/text >}}

OBITUARY.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}With great sorrow we record the
death of the Rev. Cyrus A. Chilcott.
He died of typhoid fever at the Bap-
tist Mission House, Bangkok, on the
30th of December. On the Sabbath
following his body was attended by
the various Consuls and the foreign
community to its burial, in our palm-
grove cemetery near the banks of the
Menam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following brief sketch is taken
from the remarks of Dr. Dean at the
grave.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our departed brother was a member
of a numerous and highly respected
family of Friends or Quakers, resid-
ing near Buffalo, in the State of New
York. He was a recent graduate from
the University of Rochester, and the
Theological school of the same place.
About two years ago the American
Baptist Missionary Union resolved to
resuscitate their Chinese Mission at
Bangkok and at the recommendation
of the Faculty, Mr. Chilcott was ap-
pointed as one of the men for that
service; and the experience of one
short year since he landed here, has
more than realized the high testimoni-
als of his former teachers to his fitness
for the work. He has proved himself
a man of high mental endowments and
thorough intellectual training. We
have found him a colleague of sound
judgment, wise in counsels, of refined
taste, of cheerful piety, and strong
Christian faith. His progress in the
Chinese language, and his eloquence
of speech gave promise of his great
usefulness as a Missionary to the
heathen.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Indeed his endowments gave to him
an open door of success, in any hon-
orable calling. Those who listened to
his speech before the U. S. Consular
Court, but the day before his last ill-
ness, regarded it as a pledge of his
success at the Bar, provided he had
given himself to the study of the law.
He entered the work of the Christian
Ministry and of a Missionary to the
heathen, not because he was fitted for
no other occupation, but from an en-
lightened choice, and because in his
heart's just estimation, it was a calling
of graver magnitude, and more glori-
ous results than any other upon earth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We regarded his pursuit for life as
well chosen, and had looked upon his
developments of character as a presage
of a bright career in the work of evan-
gelizing the heathen: but it seems that
God was ripening him for a higher
service in heaven.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Three nights ago, while his friends
were cherishing the fond hope that
he might soon be restored to health,
he had the strong impression that he
was soon to die, and gave to those who
watched at his bed side, an address in
which he alluded to his former life—-
the motives which led him to become
a Missionary to the heathen—-the joy
he found in his work and its surround-
ings—-the uniform kindness he had re-
ceived from all here—-and the happi-
ness with which he conformed to the
will of God whether to live or to die.
He said he had hoped to live long en-
ough to turn some of the poor heathen
from their superstition to the worship of
the living God—-"but I am ready to go
at the Master's call"-—"I have never
for one moment felt the least regret
that I came here. Tell my friends
that I die happy. I have not the
transporting raptures which attend
some death bed scenes, but my heart
is full of heavenly peace. The
whole address was complete in its
conception expressed in well chosen
and significant language, and pro-
nounced with a simple pathos, which
gave to the listeners the impression
that it was little less than an inspira-
tion from the Holy One.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the morning he took a cheerful
farewell of the friends, giving to each
appropriate parting words, and direct-
ing the disposal of his effects. He
then cordially invited the little boys,
Willie and Freddie, to come and see
him in his new house in the happy
land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Soon after, when asked if he felt
pain he said "no, it is like a pleasant
sleep—or rather like a pleasant wak-
ing." Afterward he said, "If this
is dying—and I suppose it is—then it
is pleasant to die."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following night was passed in a
dreamy sleeplessness and on Saturday
morning in answer to the enquiry how
are you? he said "I am better—-I am
most well." At 10 A. M. he was taken
with a spasmodic struggle of the body
to hold on to life. The mental had al-
ready fought the battle and won the
victory—-and the physical combat at
length gave place to a quiet rest and
at 2 ½ P. M. he slept in Jesus.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have heard eloquent appeals for
Christ and his salvation from those lips
now sealed in the silence of the coffin.
He still speaks to us by a holy life and a
blameless example, and from the solemn
stillness of the dead, there comes the
significant language.— “Be ye also
ready, for in such an hour as ye think
not the Son of man cometh.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have read the Apostle’s trium-
phant song “I have fought a good
fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith, and henceforth
there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness which the Lord the right-
ous Judge will give to me in that day”
and I seem to hear from that en-
coffined form, the responsive echo to
the sentiment, I have fought a good
fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith, and henceforth
there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness. Yes, on that brow of
manly thoughtfulness, so recently
marked with pain, and unstained by
the dews of death, shall be placed by
the Redeemer’s hand a crown that will
glitter in glory, when the jeweled
coronets of Queens and Emperors shall
be mingled in their common dust.{{< /news/text >}}

A Love Tale.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
For the Bangkok Recorder
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}MR. EDITOR:-—We read and hear
much these days about love. We are
accustomed to see in print, affecting
tales which are oftentimes calculated
to draw tears from our eyes although
we know there is scarcely a word of
truth in them. The tale however
that I am going to tell you is literally
true. It may not amount to much
when told, but it may serve to show
the condition of women in this country,
and how she is enslaved. It is a well
known fact that in contracting mar-
riage relations, the girl in question has
generally nothing to do in the matter,
but the whole affair rests in the hands
of her parents.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some short time ago one of the
boys in our employ met a young lady
who lived some distance "up town"
and was smitten with her. He
sought an interview with her as soon
as possible, and an attachment sprang
up between them, which resulted in
an engagement. But as they were
both young,—-the boy about twenty and
she fifteen;—-they wisely concluded to
postpone the wedding for some months.
He was also poor, and another object
in postponing the wedding was that
he might get a little money ahead,
to give the parents in consideration
for their daughter. He went accor-
dingly, and begged the hand of the
young lady, and when the appointed
time came he was to pay the sum of
one hundred ticals. Things were
thus for a time going on smoothly
with the young couple. In the mean
time however a well-to-do Chinaman
comes along, and makes the mother
a rather flattering offer for her daughter.
He is the proprietor of a seri garden,
and may be considered a man in
rather easy circums'ances. The offer
was too much for the old lady, and
she yielded. She received from the
Chinaman a present of two gold ticals
making about thirty two ticals in sil-
ver, also a betel tray, and a number of
other things. The whole amount
which the Chinaman was to pay was
about four catties (320 ticals), with
the additional promise of occasional
valuable presents. Thus successful,
he went on and bought a number of
articles for the wedding feast which
was to be celebrated with all possible
haste. Having thus got the ball a
rolling, the old lady informed the
daughter of what had been done. She
protested, but in vain, and that night
with the true instinct of her sex, she
made her escape and came to her first
lover, and informed him of what was
going on. He accordingly concealed
the girl away, and the next morn-
ing, the mother suspecting the course
the daughter had taken, came down
both in a rage and in fear angry
at the daughter for disobeying her,
and fearing the Chinamen would hold
her to the bargain. Things were in
this state when they came to our ears.
We tried to persuade the boy to give
up the girl, but this he considered
dishonorable. We had doubts about
the propriety of having her secreted on
our premises but really sympathized
with her. We accordingly sent a
deputation to wait on the parents,
and try to propitiate them, but they
were inexorable. They demanded
the daughter that she might be pun-
ished, and made to obey her parents.
Seeing there was no hope of reconcil-
ing the parents we ordered the girl to
be dismissed. She then came begging
that she might not be sent away as
her parents would beat her to death.
The Chinaman in the mean time hear-
ing what was going on, wisely with-
drew his offer. The girl however
declared, that she would rather die
than go and live with him. Still the
parents were inexorable, and demand-
ed four catties but after several at-
tempts the matter was satisfactorily
adjusted and the happy pair are now
enjoying the "honey moon."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The want of a European Mail by the
last Chow Phya was a great disap-
pointment to very many in this city.
The cause of the failure is said to have
been the breaking of the shaft of the
English Mail Steamer somewhere be-
tween Singapore and Egypt.{{< /news/text >}}

chant from Bombay. We are informed
that he has come with the view to es-

think men of his class make good mer-

{{< news/text >}}The Steam Sugar Mill under the Su-
perintendence of Mr. Thompson on the
Thacheen River is reported to be a
perfect success—although the sugar
cane this season is quite inferior in
quality and short in quantity. The cane
nearer the sea suffered greatly by the
draught in July and August. But the
fields further North have turned out a
good crop. It is calculated that there
will be only about half as much sugar
made this season as in years past. But
the way is now thoroughly opened for
expansion and great success in years
to come.{{< /news/text >}}

"Definition of the
word Fenian."
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Manx Clergyman, says the "Illus-
trated London News gives the fol-
lowing explanation of the term
"Fenian" from Dr. Kelly's Manx and
English Dictionary; a work written in
1766, but only now committed to the
Press. Feniaght, singular—plural
Fence, a champion. hero, giant. This
word in the plural is generally used to
signify invaders or foreign spoilers,
which inclines me to suppose that
these Fence were either the Feni of
Ireland, for so were the inhabitants of
Ulster called, or the Poeni or Phoeni-
cians of Carthage."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The stories told of the prowes
and size of these giants are wonderful.
Irish, Fianna Erin signifies a kind of
militia."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Vaccination." The immortal Jen-
ner has just been set up on a pedestal
at Boulogne in France. The statue
which is made of iron, has been bron-
zed all over to protect it from the
effects of the weather. It is ten feet
high and stands on a granite pedestal,
elevated to twelve feet, making the
entire height from the basement to
crown of the head twenty two feet.
It is erected as "A recognition of
France to the merits of the great
Jenner," It in a most unique memorial
of a man, whose discovery has saved
more lives than any other system ever
known. During the peace of Amiens,
the efficacy of vaccination was first
introduced into France, and from that
time forward it has been steadily
practiced all over the empire. To the
project of the Statue, the Emperor
gave his unqualified support. The
ceremony of uncovering it was obser-
ved lately with considerable display.{{< /news/text >}}

French in China.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prince of Kung has been rein-
stated in all the offices of which he
was some time since unjustly deprived.
His position at present partakes of the
office of both Regent and Prime Min-
ister. Of his entire loyalty there is
no question, but serious doubts may
be entertained as to his real views on
foreign affairs. His elevation may
have for its object the possession of a
powerful position from which to ne-
gotiate with the Foreign Ministers—-
or it may be meant as a counterpiece
to the growing influence of Tseng-
kwo-fan—-or it may have both objects
in view.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The latest intelligence regarding
Tseng is both alarming and inexplic-
able. He is said to have been defeat-
ed by the Nienfei, and to be compell-
ed to make a rapid retrograde move-
ment towards the Yellow river. The
banditti are said to interrupt his com-
munication, and to make his position
rather critical.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These Nienfei are reported to be
collecting in large numbers in the pro-
vinces of Shantung and Honam, caus-
ing infinite calamity to the people and
the total annihilation of trade. That
they are banditti of a low stamp there
is no doubt, but it is very strange how
carefully they abstain from giving
cause of offence to foreigners. It
would certainly seem that they are
acquainted with the modus operandi
pursued by the British towards the
Taipings, regarding which insurgents
nothing has been heard since last mail,
neither have any tidings been published
relative to the Mahomedan rebels.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would appear likely that compli-
cations may arise between the Imperi-
al Government and the Emperor of
the French on the subject of propagan-
dism. The latter are probably unrea-
sonable and aggressive on the point—-
for instance they appropriated to them-
selves the whole site of the Governor
General's Yamun at Canton and are
building thereupon a large ecclesias-
tical establishment. Prior to the
treaty between France and China,
French Roman Catholic Missionaries
had penetrated to many parts of the
Empire, and in many cases had been
driven away after establishing mis-
sions. The French treaty secures all
the rights of property that these mis-
sionaries can establish, and some of
these rights the Provincial authorities,
in several cases, avoid to grant. Fur-
thermore, in the Province of Szechuen,
the nursery of propagandism, some
outrages have lately occurred of a
serious nature directed against the
missionaries. Viewing the subject in
all its bearings, it is probable the
French government will take prompt
action in the matter. In their politi-
cal relations with the Chinese, the
French are certainly observing
almost good faith and consideration{{< /news/text >}}
