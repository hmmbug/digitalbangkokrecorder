EXTRACTS.
Universal Suffrage.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rev. Henry Ward Beecher in a Sermon
preached in Brooklyn N. Y. Dec. 7th
1865, discoursed on Universal Suffrage in
the following remarkable language. While
it proves him to be far beyond the age in
which he lives, who shall say that twenty
years will not bring mankind fully to his
present stand point. Since he began his
illustrious carreer there have been greater
wonders than that accomplished.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And that which our fathers had
hereditarily was in their children met
by another poisonous tendency, of a
like kind. So that the doctrine of the
equality of men and their civil safety
in perfect liberty was fast receiving its
death-blow. But this war, and the
great revolution in the public mind,
together with the progress of that divine
providence which makes us as the womb
out of which higher thoughts are born,
have changed the state of things; and
we are now standing on the threshold
of a better realization of the doctrines
of civil rights than ever before was
known. The doctrine of suffrage, im-
partial, equal, and universal, is the
doctrine of to-day. It may be that it
cannot assert its full authority to-day;
but from this day forward there will
be no rest in any state, or in any part
of this nation, until this doctrine is
recognized. [Applause.] What you
can do, or what you cannot do, to-
day, may be a question; but the stream
of things in the world points toward
the augmentation of democratic ideas.
All the delayed tendencies of our
American institutions point in that
direction. All the ideas of this great
American people, when they shall have
been emancipated, from the prejudices
and hatreds engendered by slavery,
will work toward this great consum-
mation. And nothing is surer than
that the day will ere long come in this
land when civil rights will be im-
partially and universally distributed to
all men alike—and among them, as
highest and chiefest, suffrage, which
makes a man a potentate among his
fellow sovereigns.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And I do not stop at the point of
suffrage as between skin and skin. The
mere question of color is transient.
There is a deeper prejudice as between
sex and sex than there is as between
skin and skin. And the day is com-
ing, not only when every man, though
he be dark as midnight, shall vote;
but when, as the household gather
around the family altar to read God's
Word, so father, and mother, and
brother, and sister shall gather around
the polls to vote. And we shall never
escape from the piggish steam of politics
fill in this matter of suffrage man ceases
to put asunder what God has joined
together.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Men may think that this harping
upon the question of suffrage is a poor
and petty thing, in the presence of
greater and more substantial realities;
but tell me, if you can, what is greater
and more sublime than this very ques-
tion of suffrage. That bit of paper
which is called a vote is not mere
paper; it is the symbol of a man's will.
And what is the will of an assembled
nation? The king is a man sitting on
a throne and giving laws to an empire;
but what is he compared with an
empire sitting on a throne and giving
laws to itself? The voice of thirty
million men carries both music and
thunder; and nothing is so sublime on
God's earth as the silent omnipotence
of the ballot.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When winter has for months held the
earth in bondage, and the period come
for its emancipation, what is it that is
sent for its rescue? The driving light-
ning; the resounding thunder; the
pelting storm. The raindrops, soft
and mellow, come plashing down. All
through the night they fall, and fall;
and in the morning where is the snow?
It is wasted and gone. The rivers
are bound with icy fetters; the rain
falls, and falls, and falls; and behold
the ice is rotten and sunk to the bot-
tom, or is swept out to the sea, and
the rivers are set free. The earth is
brown and russet, and the rain still
falls, and falls, and falls; and myriads
of roots wake up and send forth green
banners: and in every tree and bush
and vine, on every hillside, through
every valley, and in every field, are
signs and tokens of resurrection. A
more wonderful power has there been
in these silent plashing drops, falling
still as dust, to bring out the green-
ness of resurrected spring, than there
would have been in myriads of the
mightiest chariots if God had sent them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Silent falls the ballot, and away go
shackles. Silent falls the ballot, and
away go bondages. Still silent falls
the ballot, and a whole continent is
renewed, and liberty stands dressed
in her spring greenery. And on God's
earth there is nothing more beauteous
and sublime than the spectacle of a
nation voting.-—N. Y. Independent.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Route with Western China.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This long-mooted subject, of such
paramount local interest, and which
has had such strong public advocacy,
unaided, unfortunately, by Govern-
ment approbation, has now a blush of
prospect upon it. The attention of the
English authorities and public has
been so frequent and strongly drawn
to it of late, and it may be supposed,
so convincingly that (it is alleged) the
Secretary of State for India has for-
warded instructions to the local Gov-
ernment to entertain the subject, and
give their attention to it, if the pro-
posed scheme be found based on
practicability. We may fancy, there-
fore, that supposing such statement
correct, and that we have thus got
the wedge so far in the matter, the
remainder of the project will not be
immensely difficult to overcome, the
contemplated route and its obvious
advantages have been so familiarized
to the public—-more immediately that
of Burma—-by repeated and lengthen-
ed discussion in the local journals,
that it would be superfluous to re-open
the outline in this brief notice of the
pleasing circumstance we record.{{< /news/text >}}

The Wonderful Railway
Engineer.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE wildest romance that was ever
written, is not so marvellous as some
true stories of the lives of great men.
Out of the humblest homes, in the
lowest depths of social life, God has
sometimes caused a man to arise, who
has attained to the summit of human
greatness, and left his impress on the
institutions of his age and country:
like the lark, that builds its lowly nest
amid the clods of the valley, and yet
soars aloft, and sings its morning song
above the clouds. But, of course, the
instances are rare of such progress
from the lowly to the lofty, and some-
time the cases are more wonderful
than instructive, for it is not easy to
note the steps, or trace the path, of
these mental gladiators of our race.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Something miraculous, either in them-
selves, or their circumstances, or both,
makes the case a brilliant exception.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the life of George Stephenson,
while wonderful as to progress, and
astounding as to results, is chiefly in-
structive, as showing us a steady, step-
by-step plodding career, from the lowest
rindle [?] in the social ladder to the highest.
He had a long climb, a heavy toil, a
hard struggle, before he gained a good
position, and began to breathe the free
air of success, or bask in the sunshine
of prosperity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Robert and Mabel Stephenson, were
a poor, honest couple, who lived at
the colliery village of Wylam—eight
miles from Newcastle-on-Tyne. Like
many labouring people, they had but
one room, in a little detached house
still standing, whose four apartments
were let off to as many families. Mabel,
though of delicate constitution, was
spoken of as “a real canny body,”
which means in Northumberland, a
good housewife, a kind, sensible woman.
Robert was of a slender frame, and
most amiable disposition. He had an
eye for all that was beautiful in nature,
and a heart to feel both love and pity
to the animal creation. His occupa-
tion was that of fireman to the pumping
engine of the colliery. His wages
were twelve shillings a week. Their
family consisted of six children—James,
George, Eleanor, Robert, John, and
Anne, at the average difference of two
years between the ages of each child.
George was born June 9th, 1781. Poor
neighbours, who yet remember the
family, bear this honourable testimony
to them. “They had very little to
come and go upon, they were honest
folk, but sore hadden down in the
world.” “Honest folk!” What a
blessing to inherit an honest name,
and to have during childhood an
honest example. This poor, but
virtuous home, was the only school
the children knew; bread was dear,
and it was hard to get them food, so
schooling was altogether beyond them.
It was a great day for little George,
when he was first trusted to carry his
father’s dinner to him, and to take
charge of his little brothers and sister,
and keep them from straying on the
wooden tram-road, where the children-
waggons dragged the coal past the
doorway of the Stephenson’s lowly
dwelling.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When George was eight years old,
the family following their work, remov-
ed to Dewley Burn, a few miles off,
and here George first began to earn an
honest penny by labour. A widow,
named Grace Ainslie, had a little farm,
and her cows used to graze on the sides
of the tram-road or waggon-ways, and
she needed a boy to herd them, and
keep them from straying. For this
service, little George had twopence a
day. While watching the cows, the
boy found time to make whistles out
of reeds, and to model clay engines, in
a bog near at hand, a proceeding that
looked not much more inviting than
making dirtpies, but the mechanical
genius of the future engineer was even
then stirring within him. Before the
child could stride across the furrows,
he was set to leading the horses at
ploughing, and he used to say in after
life, he went to work when other child-
ren were asleep in their beds. For-
tunately, it was work in the open air,
and he had intervals of leisure for play,
so it did not hurt him. His wages
rose gradually from twopence to four-
pence, and then he was taken on to
work at the colliery as a “picker,”
(taking stones and rubbish out the coal)
until he reached the sum of eightpence
a day. He is said then to have been
“a grit bare legged laddie,” full of fun,
and always trying to imitate every-
thing he saw or heard, but never in
all his frolics, unkind. He was very
fond of birds, and a favourite black-
bird used to roost in his cottage, fly
out and enjoy its liberty all day, and
even depart to the woods to pair and
rear its young, returning for shelter in
bad weather, to George, and this went
on for years.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At fourteen years of age, George
thought it a great promotion when he
was taken on to assist his father in
firing the engine, at the wages of a
shilling a day. He now began to study
the engine, in the hope of the sooner
doing a man’s work, and earning a
man’s wages. He had no one to teach
him anything; it was by cleaning and
taking to pieces as he could, different
parts, that the meaning and purpose
of the whole came into his mind. His
diligence was observed, and by the
time he was sixteen, he was put to
firing a pumping engine at a neighbour-
ing pit, and when, on the first Satur-
day night, he was paid twelve shillings
for his week's work, the same wages
his father earned, he said as he come
out and told his fellow workmen, "Now
I'm a made man for life."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From this time to his eighteenth
year, he continued to make progress,
and gained the character of a clever,
steady workman, always to be depend-
ed on. But while he was thus improv-
ing as a worker, a new want sprung
up in his mind. He could neither
read nor write. He had the good
sense to perceive that it was needful if
he was to continue to improve his
condition, he must be able to do both.
So no false shame prevented him from
making a beginning, grown man as he
now appeared, at his book. He found
a teacher, Robin Cowens, who kept
an evening school, and George paid
threepence a week, and began the
mystery of reading and writing. He
did not learn very fast; everything
was gradual in George Stephenson's
progress. After a year's study, he was
pleased at the age of nineteen, to be
able to write his name. Soon after, a
Scotchman named Andrew Robertson
set up a night-school, and as he was
a skilful arithmetician, George Stephen-
son became his scholar; and soon took
great delight in figures, employing his
thoughts during the day in doing his
sums mentally, and making great
progress. The good young workman
was very happy at this time, and he
was the means of happiness to others.
His parents were comforted for all their
trials by seeing how steady and diligent
their son was. Round his engine fire,
flocks of birds, mostly robins, would
gather for the crumbs he gave them,
and his faithful dog daily brought his
dinner in a can suspended round his
neck, to the pit. Every living thing
loved the brave and gentle youth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When he was twenty years of age,
and after some difficulty from the envy
of an overseer, he had learned to be
"a Breaksman," with wages from £1
14s. to £2 a fortnight; he learned in
his evening hours to mend shoes, and
as he did all he undertook in the best
manner he was able, he soon became
expert as a shoe-mender. This new
branch of employment was destined
to effect an important change in his
condition. Fanny Henderson, a young
servant at a neighbouring farm-house,
was not only fair to the eye, but good
and sweet-tempered; one of those
young woman whose modesty and
worth elevate womanhood. Her
shoes went to George to sole, and the
young man with all the fervour of his
honest love, carried the shoes about
with him in his pocket, and was proud
and pleased that he had made "a good
job of them,"—no doubt Fanny thought
so to.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Out of this shoe-mending business,
George saved his first guinea, and be-
gan to consider himself as he said,
"a rich man." He was rich in the best
sense. Good health and good conduct
are true riches. When his fellow-
workmen on Saturday afternoons were
lounging about with bad companions,
or spending their earnings at the pub-
lic house, George was taking the engine
to pieces, cleaning it, learning it all
by heart, and it was then said of him,
"He never missed a day's work, and
never was intoxicated in his life."{{< /news/text >}}

A wood Thief Surprised.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A gentleman living in Terra Haute,
whose stove wood melted away faster
than was warranted by the mildness of
the weather, charged a fine looking
stick with a few ounces of powder, and
left it on the pile. The Express thus
relates the sequel:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Wednesday forenoon an explosion
was heard in a house near by, and a
kitchen window was spared no panes.
On going to the spot, a sight might
have been seen. The stove had joined
a peace conference, a kettle of pork and
cabbage shot up through the roof like
an arrow. A dish of apples stewing
on the stove, gave the ceiling the ap-
pearance of a map of California: A
cr[?]t was sleeping under the stove
went through the broken window as
though after the doctor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The cat has not been heard from
since, but a smell of burnt cat hair
pervades that house very thoroughly.
A flat iron was hoisted into a pan of
dough, a chair lost three legs, the
wood-box looks sick, while the roof of
the house looks like a bursted apple

John Adams' Courtship
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A correspondent of the Boston Tran-
script gives the following interest-
ing reminiscence:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}John Adams sought the hand of the
daughter of Rev. Mr. Smith, of Wey-
mouth, and Miss Abigail was pleased
to accept the proposal of Mr. Adams,
much to the chagrin of the parson,
the objection being that Adams was a
man of humble origin and moderate
ability, and could never aspire to any-
thing more than the position of a hum-
ble village lawyer. His visits to her
home were frequent and prolonged, but
no hospitalities were tendered by the
Rev. Mr. Smith, either to Adams or his
nag, for while Abigail only had watch-
ful care over him, his "bay" passed
the weary hours of night in feeding
on the hitching post.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now, Abigail had a sister whose
name was Mary, who was betrothed
to a wealthier, and it was believed
more promising young man, whose
presence was welcomed most cordially
by the reverend's family.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The good parson had promised
each of his daughters that on the oc-
casion of their marriage he would
preach a sermon from a text of the
bride's own selection. Mary first
married, and "beautifully appropriate"
did the father think the text— "And
Mary hath chosen that good part!" In
due time Abigail marries, and chooses
for her text, "For John came neither
eating nor drinking, and they say, He
hath a devil." Tradition does not tell
us, as we remember, how the text
pleased the father, but the sermon was
preached, Mary, indeed, chose a good
part; her life was a happy one, and
her husband was a man of means and
respectability. Abigail was a woman
of strong affections, a practical wife,
and possessed a great nobility of char-
acter, while the names of her husband
and son will live as long as the love
of liberty inspires the soul of man.{{< /news/text >}}

Working and Thinking.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a no less fatal error to despise
labor when regulated by intellect, than
to value it for its own sake. We are
always in these days trying to separ-
ate the two; we want one man to be
always thinking, and another to be al-
ways working, and we call one a gen-
tleman and the other an operative;
whereas, the workman ought often to
be thinking, and the thinker ought
often to be working; and both should
be gentlemen in the best sense. As
it is, we make both ungentle, the one
envying, and the other despising his
brother; and the mass of society is
made up of the morbid thinkers and
the miserable workers. Now it is on-
ly by labor that thought can be made
healthy, and only by thought that
labor can be made happy, and the
professions should be liberal, and there
should be less pride felt in peculiarity
of employment, and more in excellence
of achievement.—Anon.{{< /news/text >}}

What an Iron Bar Became.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A bar of iron worth five dollars
worked into horse-shoes, is worth ten
dollars and a half, made into needles,
it is worth $355; made into penknife
blades, it is worth $3,285; made into
balance-springs of watches, it is worth
$250,000.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What a drilling the poor bar must
undergo to reach all that; but ham-
mered and beaten and pounded and
rolled and rubbed and polished, how
was its value increased! It might well
have quivered and complained under
the hard knocks it got; but were they
not all necessary to draw out its fine
qualities, and fit it for higher offices!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And so, all the drilling and training
to which you are subject, all the trials
and hardships, thumps and pains which
often seem so hard to you, serve to
bring out your nobler and finer qual-
ities, and fit you for more responsible
posts, and greater usefulness in the
world.{{< /news/text >}}

The Royal remains of His
Majesty the 2nd King.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having learned that it would be
agreeable to the friends of His Ma-
jesty the late second king to have his
European and American friends
visit his remains in the royal urn, we,
in company with our wives and
children presented ourselves on the
morning of the 27th inst. at the gate
of the WANGNA for this purpose.
Here we found our friend and near
neighbor Phya Mont'ean Tawraisan
the Prime Minister for the Wangna
department waiting for us according
to appointment. He requested us to
be seated until he could exchange his
silk apparel for one entirely of white
which Siamese custom very properly,
as we think, consider the most suita-
ble for mourning purposes. His Ex-
cellency took off nearly every thread of
raiment in which he came from home
and dressed himself entirely in white
cotton shirting ; and this he did in
our presence so adroitly as not to ex-
pose his person in the least. Being
thus ready, His Excellency conducted
us through a ponderous gate of the
palace, across a beautiful lawn into
the private chapel of the second king.
Its name is P'rat'minang Poot'ienwan
it would seem to have been originally
used for a royal audience hall. It is
probably not less than 100 feet long,
40 wide and as many high to the ceil-
ing. Its walls, as usual, have hosts
of angelic beings painted on them.
Towards the further end of the hall
sit the chief brazen idol on a throne
fifteen feet high. The plat-form of
its seat was pyramidal in form some-
what like a pagoda with rectangular
gradations on which smaller idols were
placed. We noticed one of silver, one
of gold, and one of glass. These were
all furnished with the usual showy
articles of glass, gold and silver shrub-
bery, sundry figures made of alabaster
and marble, artificial flowers and
fruit etc.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We were next conducted out of this
chapel to another royal hall under
another roof, called P'rat'minang Itasra
Winitch'ie—-the throne of royal judg-
ment. This hall is about the size of
the chapel hall, but more richly fin-
ished and furnished. On entering it
you are struck with the display made
toward the further end. Your eyes
fix at once on the royal urn standing
on an octagonal pyramid twenty feet
high. Directly over it there is sus-
pended a seven storied white canopy
each story having a gilded band en-
circling it. The lower story may be
six feet in diameter, the top one less
than one foot, and the intervening ones
all evenly graduated to those extremes.
The whole canopy is about ten feet
high, suspended from a small circular
niche in the ceiling. The short handle
of it appears to rest on a small gold
ball on the top of the spire of the urn.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The urn has the appearance of being
most richly decked with precious stones
but probably there is far more of show
than reality. Its size and shape is adapted
to an adult human body in a sitting
posture. The part for the shoulders
is the broadest, that for the neck much
smaller, and that for the head a little
enlarged, with the form of a Siamese
crown on its top, and a gilded spire
extending from it to the canopy. Its
general form appears to be octagonal.
Its foot is a little larger than its mid-
dle. In this urn we were informed
the royal remains are seated clothed in
full state with a crown upon the head.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The base of the pyramidal throne
on which the body sits is probably not
less than forty-five feet in circumfer-
ence. It is narrowed to the proper size
for receiving the royal urn by right
angle graduations. On these are tastefully
arranged small artificial trees made of
solid gold and silver placed under
glass screens—artificial flowers and
fruit made of glass porcelain and
other materials—alabaster and mar-
ble figures of men women and child-
ren—silver, bronze, and glass figures
of birds celestial and terrestial—splen-
did lamp-stands all fitted with white
wax candles etc. etc.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The body of the pyramid makes a
brilliant appearance of itself, because
of its carved work heavily gilded,
with small pieces of glass blue, green
and brilliant accurately cut into di-
verse angles and forms, neatly fitted
in the carving. But the appearance is
doubtless vastly richer than the reality.
The glass is made in Siam in the form
of globes with a lining of lead on the
inside. By cutting the lead lining
in any form you please, the glass
breaks precisely in that form. Most
of the Siamese showy articles of
state are thus decked and made to look
brilliant and rich with comparatively
little cost above that of the work of
carving and setting in the glass. The
articles look well at a distance but will
not bear close inspection.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In front of the royal pyramid there
is a strip of gold cloth six inches wide
and twenty or thirty feet long extend-
ing down from the urn along the
front side of the pyramid, and its
lower end neatly folded and laid on a
stand. The object of this strip or
band is to form a communication be-
tween the body of the deceased, the
officiating priests, and the sacred books.
Hence all the priests take hold of it
when performing certain of their re-
hearsals. Just at the foot of this stand
is a card-rack in which are sundry
letter-envelopes in mourning, contain-
ing letters of condolence, probably,
that have been received by the Supreme
king or other relatives of the deceased
king. On the right hand side of the
throne is the toilet which the deceased
used when living. The stand, pitcher,
wash-bowl, tumblers, soap, towels,
mirror, &c. are just as we used to see
them in His Majesty's dressing room.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We noticed behind the base of the
throne two small figures of white
persons carved out of alabaster stout
or white marble horribly emaciated,
sitting on the floor, each with one foot on
the knee. We could not divine for what
purpose they were put there, unless
it be to symbolize the wasting power
of disease and that death is certainly
approaching even kings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A little to the right of the pyramid
is a real throne, used by the de-
ceased in life—and there is another of
superior dimensions in the rear of the
hall. The seat of the former may be
4 feet above the floor—-the latter 8 or
10 feet. Each of these is covered by the
usual Sawckrâ chât or the many storied
royal umbrella. In front of the royal
pyramid are four artificial trees from
5 to 6 feet high made, it was said, of
solid gold. And in the rear there
are four silver trees of the same size
made of solid silver. There are round
about the pyramid the usual gold
wrought standards of royalty from
12 to 16 in number. They are simply
the Sawckrachât on a smaller scale
than those covering the thrones. Some
are 3—some 5—and some 7 stories
high. On the left hand of the pyra-
mid is a large spittoon made apparently
of solid gold; and near by are the
gold sandals which His Majesty wore
whenever he appeared in his most mag-
nificent estate. We took them up and
examined them critically. The inner
sole is a thick plate of fine gold—and
the under one of common leather
having the ball of the foot decked
with what appeared to be small rubies
and diamonds, but more probably of
glass composition. The uppers of the
sandals were adorned with the same
material. We noticed a gold betel
box which we could more readily be-
lieve is enriched by many small dia-
monds and rubies. The gold pin with
which the deceased fastened his top-
knot when a little boy was displayed
on a plate of corresponding richness
with other precious mementoes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The whole area of the spacious
hall occupied by the pyramid and its
appurtenances was screened from the
other parts by rich tapestry. The one
in front was woven with beautiful
figures of gilded flower vases. The
one in the rear had small leaves cut
from sheets of pure gold sewed with
great labor upon the woolen fabric,
thickly studding the whole with heavy
gold plate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When we entered the hall, the front
curtains were opened to give us full
view. And when we were retiring
they were closed. During nearly all
the half hour we were in the hall a
band of 12 Buddhist priests were en-
gaged in chanting a kind of funeral
dirge. A little before we closed our
observations we heard the word given
that it was time for them to take their
last meal for the day. There were
twelve little trays of food arranged
in a row all ready for them. The
dirge ceased and a far more pleasant
exercise for them followed. Their
food appeared to be neatly prepared,
and was indeed quite tempting to the
writer, not to enlarge upon the zest
with which the clerical fraternity par-
took of it,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are informed that this chanting
of the priests and feeding them is to
be continued daily until the final cere-
monies take place about 10 months
hence.{{< /news/text >}}

Correspondence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
For the Recorder.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}SIR,-— Your correspondent in her
last article without having rightly de-
fined the nature of that concluding
remark "taking away at one sweep
the whole object of salvation and the
teachings of scripture" has made an
assertion at once so grave, and so per-
fectly contrary to the spirit of the
article she refers to, that I am forced,
most unwillingly, upon holier ground
than I had ever dreamed of entering.
I cannot stop to trifle with the why or
wherefore, but with all reverence, and
all the kindliness that a common faith
inspires, beg to refer 'Penelope' to
our mutual 'Sublime Instructor'—-who
has alone pointed out, by his every
day walk in life, the loftiest possible
height of human virtue-—who alone
reached up to, and compassed that most
perfect of philosophical truths "char-
ity"—-who in the mysterious promp-
tings of His infinite sympathy with
man, lived, died and awoke again in
this world of ours, for us, and in order
that "all" might share in the full and
perfect "fruition" of his good work,
and now "ministers" for us and our
frailties, at the right hand of Him
whom creation calls God, Revelation
Light, but Wisdom Compassion; for
it was from His teaching and practical
life, I discovered (however imperfectly)
that though he mixed freely with the
world—-saw it as only He could in all
its various aspects, said never a word,
nor let fall from His sacred lips the
smallest or feeblest whisper of a cen-
sure against any of the forms of social
enjoyment, customs &c. of his day—-
that when some would be righteous
persons rebuked him for eating with
publicans and sinners, He replied
"Go ye and learn what that meaneth
I will have mercy and not sacrifice";
further that he emphatically enjoined
on His followers, as a right, just, and
bounded duty to "render unto Caesar
the things which are Caesar's, and unto
God the things which are God's."
Also to every faithful steward He
charged the judicious management of
only one world, as far as I can dis-
cover, and that the present, and all
his promises of blessings, and rewards
are held out to us, to induce us first
to lead a true, honest, good life here,
in order to secure a happier one here-
after. Strange, it seems therefore, that
those who are especially commanded
to hope and believe all things favora-
ble of others, should have such an
aptitude for discovering faults, and
while straining at "a gnat"—-dancing
and its immoral tendencies,—-should
find so little difficulty in swallowing "a
camel" in the shape of "all unchari-
tableness" To such our Saviour said
"ye pay tithe of mint and cummin
but have omitted the weightier matters
of the law, judgement, mercy, faith,
these ought ye to have done, and not to
leave the others undone."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In conclusion allow me to remark
that is required just that which "Pen-
elope" pretends to ignore, (for I cannot
believe that she really does so,) a phil-
osophy that might bring a saint down
from Heaven, the Home of our high-
est ideal—to laugh with those that
laugh, and to weep with those that
weep" to become "all things to all
men" in the great work of winning
some to Christ. Or one, as broad
deep, and expansive as that of Shak-
spear's, with surface beneath surface,
and scope enough to fill the most ben-
evolent of minds to rightly appreciate
the law of mutual fitness all round,
that every thing is good in its place,
that a time being appointed to hope, to
pray, and to mourn, proves a time
appointed to laugh, to dance, to sing, to
play.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Zeal such as Penelope's in riding a
favorite "hobby" is good in its place,
too, though it does not excuse exclu-
siveness of soul, or any amount of
"bad" temper.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Jesuit may be a good type of the
faith he lives by, but that does not
justify another standing outside of the
threshold of his soul, to deny to him
that which he claims for himself.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Fangs of Africa or the Steins
of Cambodia, may have natures of
as substantial a value, as we have, and
may not be pointed at as miserable
blots, for they in the work of a "Great
Artist" form a part of a perfect whole.
If they lived as we do under the
growth of six thousand years experi-
ence, might have discovered ere this
what power there is in a courteous
and earnest examination, and not have
denied.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}carried a flame, where light alone
would suffice. To us they are not
without their value, these Fangs and
Steins, for they prove a God, and
there is much to be respected even in
their shade, laughter, joy, sorrow,
life, death, and a better resurrection.

Sokan conoluded.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Continued from No. 10.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the year of the rat, 4th of the
decade, civil era 1214 there was a
Sókan festival in the palace of the
second king of the present reign. The
mount Krilat was displayed at that
time and other things and plays more
than ordinary, but they were not of
the highest degree as was customary
for the Chówfa Sókan. They were
only similar to such as had been had
in the palace of the 2nd kings before
that time. Hence from this time for-
ward it become customary whenever
the festival of the Sókan was observed
in the palace of the second king to have
royal processions for displaying the in-
signed of royalty, and the drums of
victory; but they were held on the
New years holidays, and were not at-
tended with the highest ceremonies,
and there was no mount Krilat, and
no great ado in advertising the ceremo-
nies. This became the standard of the
Sókan festivals in the palace of the
second king for all the Práong Chóws
of the palace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But as regards the palace of the first
king there were no princes or princesses
of suitable age for receiving the honors
of the Sókan until the year of the cock,
3d of the decade. civil era 1223,
Christian era 1862. In that year as
Prachów look t'o princess Ying
yowálák had attained to a suitable age
for receiving the Sókan, the royal
council of Princes, nobles, and lords
bowed before His Majesty the Supreme
king and begged that the king would
be pleased to have a great and com-
plete Sókan festival such as has not
been held for more than fifty years—
pleading that witnesses of the complete
Sókan so long since had now become
very few, and that the few living have
forgotten much of what they then saw,
and that the vast majority of the peo-
ple now living in Siam have never
seen the like. For these reasons we
do humbly entreat His Majesty the
Supreme king to grant this our request
that it may be for example for the time
come.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whereupon the king gave command
to prepare for a great Sókan festival.
Preparations were accordingly made
complete in all their parts excepting
there was no mount Krilat.—At the
time of that festival occasion there
were added to it the ceremonies for
giving the name Chowfa Choola
Longkorn bawdin t'ará t'ép'áyom
kôot mahá boorôotáyá rátáná rátchará
wiwongs wára p'ongs bawri p'át siri
wat'á nárách'á kôoman, to His royal
Highness, engraved on a gold plate and
by this H. R. H. was promoted to the
rank of Sómdetch Prá Chów look-ya
t'ô Chówfa.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These Sókan festivals were held in
the 4th month—the year of the cock
civil era 1223, Christian era March
1862.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The custom of the royal Sókan were
established as above described. In the
year of the dog there were three chil-
dren of His Majesty who attained to
the age suitable for receiving the hon-
ors of the Sókan. There names were
Práong Chów Ying TáksInáchá, Prá-
ong Chów Ying Sómswáttce, and Prá-
ong Ying Brá P'ák-sawn. It was the
pleasure of His Majesty the king to
have these three princesses receive the
Sókan with all the usual ceremonies
as beforetime. The festival for the
three princesses was held in the 4th
month the year of dog, 4th of the de-
cade, civil era 1224, Christian era 1863.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the 4th month of the same year
there was a Sókan in the palace of the
2nd king for a Práong Chów. It was
a great festival with all the customary
ceremonies and plays, and the mount
Krilat on a small scale similar to
the one before in the year of the rat
4th of the decade.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After this, coming down to the year
of the rat, 6th of the decade there
were two Práong Chóws children of
His Majesty the Supreme king who had
arrived at the age for the Sókan. There
names were Báktará p'ímon p'áráná,
and Mahá Bhadhorn. His Majesty
having had an example in a Siamese
king of the 26th reign named Prá-
Rama Tiba[?]n Máha Rach's Prása[?]
Tawang, who had his son Práong
Chòw-In receive the Sôkan at a royal
country palace on the Island of Bân-
lane, determined to revive that old
style; and inasmuch as His Majesty
was pleased to give command that at
this time the festival of the Sôkan
should be held at His Majesty's palace
at Petchaburee according to that an-
cient custom. This took place in the
2nd month of the year of the rat, 6th
of the decade, civil era 1226, Christian
era 1864.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now according to the old and pro-
per custom of the Sókan no P'ra-ong
Chôws, who were not of the rank of
Chôwfa had a right to the higher hon-
nors of the festival. But inasmuch as
the old custom had been innovated in
the reign of P'ra-bât Sômdelet P'ra
pôôt'j-yâwif'a Chôôlalôke as also in the
reign of P'ra-bât Sômdet P'ra-pôôt'i
lot la nâp'alei in the palace of the 2nd
king when there were great proces-
sions for the Sókan made for P'ra-ong
Chôws exceeding the old custom on
two occasions, as also on two occasions
in the present reign in the palace of
the 2nd king, going beyond the cus-
tom of old time, and thus establishing
a precedent for the future, it became
a matter of necessity that in the-palace
of the Supreme king that that preced-
ent should be followed. And this is
because the honors conferred by the
Sókan are regarded of the first import-
ance, and the people who desire to
witness the ceremonies are many, and
they wait with intense interest for the
time of the Sókan festivals to arrive;
So that they cannot quite trust that
the time will come of course, but feel
impelled to beg of the king to com-
mand the ceremonies to be held.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now at this time Prince Sômdet
P'ra Chôw lôôk t'o Chôwfa Choo-
longkorn, having attained to a suita-
ble age for receiving the Sókan, being
full 12 years of age, and having pre-
viously been favored with various and
extraordinary honors equal in every
respect to those conferred formerly on
the two Chôwfas, sons of P'ra-bât
Sômdet P'ra pôôt'i lot la nâp'alei, it
seemed proper that this prince should
receive likewi-e the same most ex-
traordinary honors of the Sókan on
this occasion as were conferred on
those two former occasions that they
should stand for prveodents in the
future time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now all who shall be called out to
aid in this festival occasion let them
perform their several parts on this
festival occasion with full heart and
strength, thinking that they thus hon-
or then lords and masters.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And as concerning all foreigners
who have not become acquainted with
the history of this Sókan festival, we
beg that they will not murmur the
thought that all this ado is of no ad-
vantage to the country and the king-
dom, saying it obliges the people in
great numbers to spend their time
and strength for nought, and calls
them out in great multitudes to
squander their time in witnessing it.
We beg that they will suspend such
judgment upon the festival, for it is
regarded as of great importance in the
kingdom as may be seen by the sketch
given of it above. It is a long stand-
ing custom.—But such extraor-dinary
occasions do not occur often. There
are not usually more than one or two in
a single reign. If we should now cut
off the custom and have no more of
the festivals the people, informed in
Siamese history, would feel exceeding
bad and would murmur out their grief
by saying that the Supreme king fav-
ors so highly European custom, that
he casts away our venerable instit-
utions very easily. Hence we conclude
that it is suitable that we should hold
on to our ancient customs so that they
shall not vanish away.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now as regards the present occa-
sion for the Sókan festival, let the
people in great multitudes bring their
offerings of gold and silver, and pre-
sent them to the son of the king at
the Sókan, according to the ancient
custom from time immemorial. All
who comply with this notification are
expected to do it as a free will offer-
ing, and not as being compelled by
any command of the king; and they
will thus show themselves pleased
with the Prince who is to be the sub-
ject of the Sókan. The king makes no
demands of the kind. Whoever is
pleased to aid as above intimated or
not let him act freely. To refuse to
aid will not be regarded as any offence.
Whoever shall be pleased to make any
offerings to the prince on the occasion
will be remembered with gratitude;
and whenever he shall have any festiv-
al for cutting the top-knots of his
own children or grand children let him
inform the king of, and he will make
presents to the subject of the festival
in return according to the old custom
of reciprocity on such occasions.
Therefore let no one misunderstand or
murmur about this matter, as there
can be no good cause for it.{{< /news/text >}}

the 11th day of the waxing moon, the
year of the cow, 7th of the decade

The Weather.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having had scarcely a drop of rain
since the 5th of February, the heavens
have become brass over our heads and
the earth iron under o it feet, and
the heat quite oppressive from 10 a. m.
to 4 p. m. There were signs of rain
yesterday for the first time in seven
weeks. It was quite exciting to see
the elements gathering their forces for
a storm—the heavens covered with
black clouds—thunder and windstrug-
gling, as it were, against each other—
the one bent upon bringing the rain
down, the other on driving it away.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The wind was completely victorious,
Not a drop of rain, so far as we could
see, fell upon our great metropolis in
all the bluster—It is very likely that
a small portion of Siam a little to East
of us had a shower.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Generally our evenings and morn-
ings are delightfully temperate—al-
most paradisaical. And latterly our
moonlight evenings have been so en-
chantingly sweet that one feels it hard
to retire until midnight.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We noticed last evening a magnific-
ent circle about the moon when she was
on the meridian. It was at least 60
degrees in diameter. The inner part
of it was very nearly like a rainbow
in color and the outer white like fleecy
clouds, but of uniform size of a degree
or more, most beautifully blending it-
self into the blue ether.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The longer we live in Siam the
more are we impressed with the con-
viction that God has spared no pains
in making the climate of her vast
prairielands, under tidal influence, one
of the most salubrious and delightful
in the world, and her soil without a
a parallel for its richness and inex-
haustableness. It is to our minds really
exhilarating to think of the beauty
and glory to which Siam would at-
tain, under a strong christian govern-
ment continued for scores of years,
and that such a time is surely coming
for her, however slow in its approach
and however far it may be in the
future.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty the king left on Sunday
morning the 23rd, and is expected to
return in time to send his mail by the
next "Chow Phya". In consequence
of His Majesty's absence as also of
H. E. Chow Phya Kalahom, the
Prime Minister, we are quite shut out
from getting news from head quarters.
The royal court has, for the time be-
ing, been removed to Petchaburee
some 80 miles distant, and there is no
telegraphic line or railroad or other
rapid steam connection between the
two seats of government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are happy to be able to inform
our readers, that we have in hand a
communication from the Siamese gov-
ernment for our Siamese paper, receiv-
ed before His Majesty's departure, as-
suring us that the English Company
who requested the privilege of making a
Telegraphic line through Siamese terri-
tory to connect Calcutta, Maulmain and
Bangkok with Singapore, will certainly
obtain their petition; and that the gov-
ernment has great hopes of the usefulness
of that line. Surely this looks quite
encouraging for Siam as well as for
all this Eastern world. Let us rejoice
in the hope of Siam's continual pro-
gress in improvements. We hope in
our next to give a translation of that
interesting document.{{< /news/text >}}

Fright at the Royal Mint.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some of our readers may, perhaps,
recollect that one of the correspondents
of the "Recorder," some three weeks
since, inquired "if we were never to get
any more of the new flat Ticals," and at
the same time complaining that "the old
bullets have mostly become so worn
by use that it is very difficult to pass
them." We have quite recently been
surprised to hear that that very short
article of the most simple and plain
English has been so misread that it
created a wonderful hubbub at the
royal Mint. It was understood to
complain of the flat Ticals as being
difficult to pass on account of their
spurious qualities. What a pity it is
that the Siamese government has not
provided herself with correct readers
of the Queen's English (not of the
King's) from her own sons! And
since, even now, after fifteen years of
the most enlightened reign Siam has
ever had, she has scarcely one such in
any grade from the throne to the dung-
hill. How strange it is that she does not
more thoroughly awake to a sense of
the importance of having many such
men!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now since her best English schol-
ars made that gross mistake in reading
those few words in our paper, one of
the men concerned in the Mint, we
learn, was suddenly thrust into prison
last Sunday morning under the impres-
sion that he, probably, had been en-
gaged in making the flat Ticals of spu-
rious material as was supposed to be
complained of in the article alluded to,
and several of the overseers of the
Mint have been frightened almost out
of their wits lest terrible judgment
shall fall upon them also in the awful
confusion. They have dispatched mes-
senger after messenger to enquire of us
into the certain meaning of the article
in question. And we have been very
unhappy to quiet their fears with the
assurance that there is not a word of
complaint in it of the new flat Ticals,
nor indeed of the old "bullets" as to
their genuineness, but simply an en-
quiry why govername t does not issue
more of the new and far preferable
coin.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Mr. C. Markham has completed his
report on the Chinchoua cultivation of
Ceylon. The experiment has proved
quite successful. He brings strong
testimony to show that the plants ac-
climatised in India are likely greatly
to excel the original ones of South
America in the yield of alkaloids. The
young prunings yield large quantities
of quinine, and the quantity of alka-
oids is increased by the growth of moss
round the stem. Moreover strips of
bark can be continually taken from the
same tree without injuring it, if only
the wounds are at once covered by
moss. The red bark of India and
Ceylon will fetch as high a price as the
Caliaya of Bolivia, the most valuable
of all the barks, or 4s. a pound. In the
chinchoua bark there are 4 febrifuge
substances found in proportions vary-
ing with the species of plant., viz.;
quinine, quinidine, cinchonidine and
cinchonine. The best chemists state
that quinidine and cinchonidine are
nearly equal in their effects to quinine,
although the latter only is of any com-
mercial value at present, but it is of
the greatest importance to get rid of
the prejudice and error on this point.
For this purpose a commission of
medical men should be appointed to
report upon the subject. The estimat-
ed number of plants in Ceylon is
550,000 and of those on the Neilgher-
ries 776,000. So that, with the plants
in various stations in India, the cul-
tivation has now reached about a mil-
lion and a half since the first plants were
introduced six years ago. Private
enterprise has taken up the cultivation
which promises to add enormously to
the wealth of India, while it reduces
the almost prohibitory cost of quinine
to the poor.—Maulmain Advertiser.{{< /news/text >}}

Saigon.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The official Courrier of Saigon is
enthusiastic on the progress of the
French settlement of "Cochin-China."
The revenue has risen from 1,344,000
francs in 1862 to 4,063,000 francs last
year and an estimate of 973,000 francs
more this year. Most of the increase
seems to be due to the tax on villages,
the sale of land, and the harbour and
customs dues. We are not told what
the settlement costs France, but the
expense must be in the same propor-
tion as that of Algeria, for there is a
proportionally large military force.
The writer says "Aucune question
n'intéresse plus l'avenir de la colonie
que l'instruction publique. La grand-
eur future de la Cochin-chine dépend
de la conquête morale de l'élément
annamite." In the three provinces of
the settlement the only large towns
are Saigon and Cholon which have a
united population of more than 60,000
souls. A sum of 20,000 francs has
been assigned for an Exhibition of
industry and agriculture. It is a pity
that an opposition paper is not allow-
ed in Saigon any more than in Paris,
that we might know exactly how much
of the Courrier's picture is real.{{< /news/text >}}

Our Commercial Interests
in China.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are particularly pleased to find
by the English papers, that the ac-
counts which India has for some months
past received of the piracies opposed
to our trade at some of the ports of
China, have also reached England; and
it is stated that "the condition of our
China trade will be brought before
Parliament on an early day after its
opening." This is a circumstance
which has long pleaded for such a dis-
cussion and investigation; and possi-
bly no more opportune period has
occurred, than now, when having the
tried and tactical man, Sir Rutherford
Alcock, on the spot as our Envoy at
the Court of Pekin; under whose
cogitations and energy the serious
matter may be expected to be prac-
tically dealt with. All that is gen-
erally known, even in India, consists
of occasional and isolated newspaper
paragraphs; which information simply
amounts to the concise fact, that our
trade along the whole seaboard of
China is now and again seriously
damaged by pirates, over whom we
seem to have no power, and at whose
mercy our coasting vessels are left
completely. It need not of course be
for an instant doubted, that such an
injurious as well as inglorious state of
things cannot be left uninterfered with,
and such a blot on the name of Eng-
land be allowed to continue. The
questions on the subject are, how and
why does it continue? This seems to
be the great and leading fact for en-
quiry—-in connection with which the
Home News suggests as queries; "Is
our naval power in these waters suf-
ficient to protect our commerce? If it
be, what is the cause of its failure to
do so? Does it arise from injudicious
distribution, or want of vigilance?" It
may be thought that these are pro-
blems of very easy solution, by author-
ity on the spot—-and, assuredly, the
sooner they are solved, and satisfac-
torily so, the better for English trade
in that locality, and the more cre-
ditable to the national character. By
latest accounts from the country, it
would appear that piracy has reached
such a fearful height of impunity in
the Chinese and Malayan seas, "that
it is now carried on openly, in day-
light, and without the least shadow of
disguise." As far as we can judge
from the eastern intelligence which
reaches us, Japan seems to be the
great centre of attraction of the Ad-
miral's attention; and, barring the
serious matter we are descanting on,
it might be all very well to endeavour
to force an extension of an incipient
trade in that country, which there can
be no doubt will eventually become
valuable; but surely an already rich
and extensive one should not be left
unprotected in our commercial chiv-
alry at Yokohama. This conduct to
seems to us to savour of that want of
prudential philosophy, which we are
warranted to expect from great com-
mercial nations. It looks very much
like neglecting the goose, in our an-
xiety for the golden egg. Such is not
precisely complimentary to English
policy, it is true; yet it is a miniature
portrait of what is just now going on,
as above represented, with English
commerce in China, through the non-
suppression of piracy. We must hope
accordingly.—-Maulmain Advertiser.{{< /news/text >}}

Men Who Cannot Make
Speeches.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the most singular develop-
ments of the times is the appearance
in American public life of a class of
men who cannot make speeches. Thus,
we have a Lieutenant-General who,
when he is fairly cornered by the ad-
miring crowd, will make two or three
polite bows, but will not let a word
out of his mouth any more than he
would Pemberton out of Vicksburg,
or Lee out of Richmond. Gen. Sher-
man, on similar occasions, attempts
but the most meagre replies, although
he is ready and pungent enough with
his pen. Gen Thomas returns thanks,
and that is all; while the gallant Sher-
idan simply says: "excuse me boys,
you know I never make speeches.-

Education in India.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Bring an extract from a Speech of
Sir Mumookhjee Cursetjee of Bombay,
at the Enquiry.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Education in India, till 30 years ago,
had lain dormant, and was still sur-
rounded by almost insurmountable
obstacles. Among the enlightened
class in India, the number of which
might almost be counted upon the
fingers, there was but one opinion—-
namely, that the only way to promote
the improvement of the native popula-
tion morally, intellectually, and politi-
cally was by advancing education,
male and female, in every legitimate
manner. The half enlightened class,
by their own intercourse with Europe-
ans, and by witnessing the progress
made by native youths educated in
the colleges of India, were convinced of
the advantages of education, but would
only allow their children to avail them-
selves of it to a limited extent. When
the Native Education Society of Bom-
bay—-established a quarter of a cen-
tury ago, chiefly through the exertions
of Mountstuart Elphinstone, who had
done more for India than all the other
governors put together—began its opera-
tions, many Parsees and other influen-
tial natives, fearing that the schools
would exercise undue influence over
the minds of the natives in converting
them to Christianity, withheld their
support. On becoming a director of
that society in 1838 he offered a prize
for an essay, to be written by one of
the head boys, upon female education,
but the managers decided that the sub-
ject was not suited for general ventila-
tion, and the money he had given for
the prize remained to this day unap-
propriated. Since then, however, 50
essays and hundreds of articles on the
question of female education had been
written and published in India. An
impression prevailed that as children
became more educated and enlighten-
ed they were more likely to embrace
Christianity. The topic was a very
delicate one, and perhaps he ought not
to touch on it in that assembly. He
was not a Christian himself, but the
more men's minds were enlightened
and the more they saw of life the bet-
ter, he believed, they would be able to
judge for themselves on this subject.
If any of the natives thoroughly believ-
ed that Christianity was for their good,
it was far better that they should
declare their conversion openly than
that they should remain hypocrites,
thinking one thing and doing diame-
trically the opposite.{{< /news/text >}}
