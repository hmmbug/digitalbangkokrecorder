Bangkok July 1st.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The city has settled down again into its
usual monotony. Since our last issue we
have scarcely a local item worth recording.
The presence of the officers and band from
H. B. M. Ship Princess Royal for a short
time revived our spirits, but since there
departure we have experienced a kind of
reaction. A visit to this port from so large
a vessel as the Princess Royal, and especially
the Flag ship of Admiral King, is an event
to be remembered. Some of us who had
never seen so large a war vessel were an-
xious to pay her a visit. Admiral King
kindly invited all those who were desirous
to visit the Princess Royal to do so on Friday
June 16th, it being the regular day for drill
exercise on board.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A company of nineteen persons, according-
ly secured the Steamer Fairy, and left the
city on the night of the 15th, about 11
o'clock, intending to go outside and anchor
till daylight, and then be at the Princess
Royal about 8 o'clock in the morning.
We anchored about 3 o'clock and about
daylight, when we were expecting to steam
off to the ship, we were informed that we
had broken down. This was rather an un-
pleasant situation to be in, as we had not
laid in provisions for any such emergency.
We however managed to make a good break-
fast on ham, hump, and bread. We raised
the signal of distress and tried in vain to get
some native sailing boats to come to our
assistance. The Siamese ship Paragon sent
a boat to us, but being unable to give us
any assistance on our way towards the
Princess Royal we dismissed it with thanks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Fortunately the Maggie Lauder came
along with a vessel in tow, and we chartered
her to return, after going in to Paknam,
and take us out to the Princess Royal. Whilst
we were waiting for the Maggie Lauder the
Siamese Steamer Rapidity came along, and
fearing lest the Maggie Lauder might not
be able to cross the bar again until nex
tide we hailed the Rapidity. Fearing how-
ever she might not heed our call, and hav-
ing some of the officers of the Princess
Royal with us, we had them dress in full
uniform and placed in a conspicious place,
to give the call an air of authority. After
considerable calling on our part the com-
mander of the Rapidity brought her too,
and "laid her alongside of us in a most
gallant manner," and we then informed
him what we wanted. Having had orders,
however, to return immediately to Bangkok,
he was unwilling to transgress his orders
lest his back might suffer the penalty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After we had assumed the responsibility
he agreed and we went on board, leaving the
Maggie Lauder to follow and bring us
back. We arrived on board of the Princess
Royal about 12 o'clock, m. and were most
kindly entertained by Captain W, G, Jones
and his brother officers. After a little rest
and partaking of an excellent lunch we
were entertained with some target practice
which had been postponed for our benefit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A number of rounds were fired at tar-
gets at the distance of 1000 and 1200 yards.
The shooting we considered excellent but
we could scarcely be considered judges, as
few of us had ever witnessed anything of
the kind before. Every shot however that
was fired, would have taken effect in the
hull of a very small vessel. Most of us
left the Princess Royal about 5 o'clock P. M.
but some remained on board until next day.
Our stay on the Princess Royal was a most
pleasant one, and the officers have our
heartfelt thanks for the manner in which
they entertained us. Our passage home
was not so pleasant, as the night was dark,
the cabin of the steamer small, and to help
the matter we were favored with a shower
of rain. The steam in the cabin, too, some-
times rose higher than that in the engine
house, but we are happy to say that few, if
any, of our party were effected by it. We
arrived at home about 1 o'clock on Satur-
day morning, amply repaid by what we had
seen, for all our difficulties on the way.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Tuileries.—During the.
Revolution.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 105)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was from the Tuileries, that on the
night of the 20th June 1791, Louis and his
family set out on their ill managed and un-
fortunate attempt to escape from the king-
dom. Preparations for this flight had been
for some time making. The person with
whom the necessary arrangements were
concerted, for facilitating the departure of
the fugitives and protecting them from in-
terruption on their route, was the Marquis
de Bouillé, then military commandant of
the department of la Meurthe, la, Meuse,
la Moselle, and la Marne, comprising the
whole immediate territory from Paris to
the frontiers of the Low Countries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Notwithstanding all the Marquis' efforts
and representations on the discretion, for-
titude, and calmness necessary for such an
enterprise, he could not for a long time get
the king to fix the day. At last, after
many delays, the king wrote to him that
on the 19th June he hoped to be ready to
take his departure. But in the letter con-
veying this intimation, the writer forgot to
prefix to his cyphers the mark indicating
where there key was to be found. And it
cost M. de Bouillé eight hours labor, be-
fore he discovered the secret of their inter-
pretation. He immediately sent off the
Duke de Choiseul to the king to say that
every thing would be ready by the 19th and
that in case of any absolutely insurmount-
able impediment arising, the attempt might
still succeed although deferred till the 20th,
but after that day no chance would remain.
Although the king received this message,
he delayed till twelve o'clock on the night
of the 20th June, literally the very last
minute allowed by de Bouillé. It does not
belong to our present purpose to recount
the story of the ill-starred journey: 'tis
enough to say that the enterprise had bet-
ter never been undertaken by such imbecile
hands.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Who remembers not the words which
Shakespear puts into the mouth of the
Priest Pandulph.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"For that which thou hast sworn to do
amiss,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Is not amiss when it is bravely done;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And being not done, where doing tends
to ill,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The truth is then most done, not doing
it;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The better act of purposes mistook{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Is to mistake again."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At Paris in the meanwhile the news of the
flight of the Royal family had been spread,
and by eight o'clock crowds began to as-
semble around the Tuileries, the Hall of
the National Assembly, and other public
places. The general sentiment of indigna-
tion against the Monarch soon began to
display itself by the defacement of the
royal arms, and other similar emblems
wherever they presented themselves. The
assembly having met at 9 o'clock, the Mayor
immediately repaired to their Hall to an-
nounce in form "L' enlèvement de le roi"
or the carrying off of the king, as it was
styled. On which with dignified calmness
and an unanimity becoming the crisis, that
body passed the necessary decrees for the
despatch of couriers after the fugitive, the
detention of any person attempting to leave
the kingdom, and the maintainance of the
executive government during the absence of
its head. Drouet, the post master at Cler-
mont, was one of the parties who first re-
cognised the king, and he despatched his
son to Varennes to communicate what he
suspected to the magistrate of that town.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Accordingly when the king disguised as
a valet, applied for the passport, necessary
to enable them to pursue their journey; he
was informed that they could not be per-
mitted to leave the place that night. About
half past six on the morning of the 22d M.
Roment, aid-de-camp of Gen. Lafayette,
and M. Baillou a municipal officer arrived
at the town, and immediately proceeded to
the house in which their Majesties were
detained, and delivered to the king the de-
cree of the National Assembly for his arrest.
At eight o'clock the Royal family quietly
submitted to again take their seats in order
to be driven to Paris, in the same carriage
which had conveyed them from that capital.
Returning by Clermont and St. Menehould
they arrived about 11 o'clock at night
at Chalons where they remained till next
morning. Continuing their route they pro-
ceeded that day as far as Epernay. Here
they were joined by Messers Barnave,
Petion, De Latour, and Maubourg the com-
missioners from the National Assembly,
the two former of whom took their places
in the carriage with their Majesties. An
immense multitude and an army accompani-
ed their progress. They passed the night
of the 24th at Dormans, and at 7 o'clock
in the evening of the following day the royal
carriage, escorted by about ten thousand of
the National guards, and a mob whose
numbers had been rapidly increasing all
the way from Varennes, and amongst whom
scenes the most shocking to humanity en-
sued, * as they followed the royal carriage
along the Boulevards as far as the palace of
Louis XV where it entered the garden of
the Tuileries by the Pont Tournant.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Royal family remained in a state of
confinement until the 3d Sept following,
when the new constitution was presented
to the king by a deputation of sixty of the
assembly, and was accepted by His Majesty,
while the Queen, the Dauphin and his sis-
ter presented themselves at the door of the
apartment. After expressing in general
terms his attachment to the liberties of the
people, "there" said His Majesty to the
deputies "are my wife and my children
whose sentiments are the same as my own."
The Queen felt it necessary to confirm this
assurance however for she was from parts
king of the feelings of confidence and hope
which it seemed to imply. The next day
His Majesty proceeded to the Hall of the
assembly to give his public assent to the
new constitution. A discharge of cannon
announced the approach of His Majesty,
who, having entered the Hall, seated him-
self on a chair which had been placed for
him beside that of the President.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The members meanwhile remaining in
their places without rising, the king himself
rose when about to read his address: but
on perceiving that no one else followed his
example, he resumed his seat and proceed-
ed to speak as follows, "I have come, gen-
tlemen, to ratify solemnly in this place the
acceptance of the constitution which has
already been announced to me. I swear to
be faithful to the Nation and to the laws,
and to employ all the power delegated to
me in maintaining the constitution, and
causing the laws to be executed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After a few words in reply from the
President his Majesty signed the constitu-
tion, and then retiring from the Hall was
followed by the whole of the members who
escorted him to the sound of military music
as far as the door of the palace. As soon
however as he had escaped from public
gaze the Monarch gave free vent to the ex-
pression of very different sentiments from
those he had so recently proclaimed. Pro-
ceeding to the apartments of the Queen, who
had also been present at the scene in the
assembly, he threw himself on a chair,
and while the tears gushed from his eyes,
addressed himself to her Majesty, bewail-
ing in the bitterest terms what he called
the humiliation, she had seen him undergo.
The Queen threw herself at his feet clung
to him and joined in his cries and lament-
ations. The prospect seemed to their
Majesties one of the deepest gloom, whilst
without the palace all was popular triumph
and rejoicing.{{< /news/text >}}

assembly, a public Fete decreed by that.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}body was celebrated in Paris, in honor of
the great act, the completion of the edifice
of Freedom which had just been consumat-
ed. The constitution was solemnly proclaim-
ed by the civic authorities, before the
Hotel de Ville, in the place du Carrousel,
in the Rue St. Honore, opposite the place
Vendome, and in the Champ de Mars. In
the evening the city was brilliantly illum-
inated, and no where was there seen a more
splendid display of festoons of lights, trans-
parencies, and other such ornaments than
along the front of the Tuileries, and in the
garden of that palace. The Royal family
drove in their carriage through the streets
to witness the rejoicings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Madame de Campan relates, that when-
ever the cry of "vive le roi" was uttered
by the crowd around the royal carriage, a
man who had stationed himself by its side,
and steadily kept his place there, immedi-
ately cried out "Ne les croyez pas, vive la
nation." Dulaure remarks that the general
sentiment was most correctly expressed by
a transparency which a shoemaker of the
Rue St. Honore had placed over the door
of his shop exhibiting the following words{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent4 >}}"Vive le roi

{{< news/indent4 >}}S'il est de bonne foi."

{{< news/text >}}Gen. Grant upon arriving at Raleigh no-
tified Gen. Sherman that the Government
disapproved of his arrangement with Gen.
Johnston, and ordered the renewal of hostili-
ties. Gen. Sherman notified Gen. John-
ston to that effect. Johnston therefore pro-
posed to surrender his army upon the same
terms as that of Northern Virginia. To
this Gen. Sherman acceded, and the formal
surrender was to have been made at Greens-
boro, North Carolina, April 29th. Gen.
Schofield was to receive the surrender in
person, take charge of the arms, artillery &c.
Gen. Johnston surrendered 27,400 troops,
together with Generals Beauregard, Hardie
and Breckenridge, and also North Carolina,
South Carolina, and the Gulf States Militia.
Wade Hampton refused to surrender, and
some reports say, he was shot by Johnston
in an altercation, but others say he escaped
with Davis. Dick Taylor has offered to
surrender to Gen. Canby on the same terms.
as Johnston. Negotiations are progressing
at the mouth of the Red River for the sur-
render of Kirby Smith on the same terms
as Lee. Nine hundred confederates at
Cumberland Gap have surrendered, Mosby,
Rosser, and Imboden are still at large. Gen.
Grant returned to Washington and com-
menced the reduction of the military esta-
blishments. It is estimated that 400,000
men will immediately be mustered out of
the service.{{< /news/text >}}

of Booth are taken from the newspaper re-

{{< news/text >}}It having been ascertained pretty posi-

Potomac, a force of Cavalry at once started
in pursuit, and on the 26th April the fig-
itives were found to have secreted them-
selves in a barn near Bowling-green, in
Caroline County, Virginia. A detachment
of 28 men, of the 16th New York cavalry,
came up and surrounded the barn. Booth's
flight having been impeded by a broken
leg, he having had his horse fall with him
on the night of the assassination, thereby
fracturing his ankle. This accident finally
led to his discovery. The surgeon who re-
duced the fracture was arrested in Mary-
land, and the necessary information derived.
from him and others in the same neigh-
borhood, conducted immediately to his
hiding place in the barn. As soon as the
barn was surrounded Booth was called upon
to surrender. The following colloquy is

{{< news/text >}}Baker : "You must give up your arms
and surrender, we will give you five min-
utes to consider, and then we will burn the
barn."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Booth : "Who are you, and what do
you want !"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Baker : "We want you, and intend to
take you."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Booth : "This is a hard case. I am a
cripple with one leg; but give me a chance
for my life. Withdraw your men one hun-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}dred yards from the barn, and I will come
out and fight."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Baker: "We don't come here to fight,
but to take you prisoner. You must give
up your arms and surrender."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Booth: "I could pick off a dozen of you
while you are talking; but I do not wish
to kill anybody. I will never surrender
though. Never be taken alive."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Baker: "Then we will fire the barn."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Booth: "Well, my brave boys, prepare
a stretcher for me."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Harold by this time having concluded
to surrender, thrust his wrists through the
door to be handcuffed, and was then drag-
ged out, denounced as a coward by his
desperate companion. All this took place
in the dark, the night being cloudy. Co-
lonel Conger, in command of the cavalry,
being satisfied that further parley was use-
less, set fire to the hay through the crevices
of the barn, and the building was soon in
flames. Through the cracks between the
boards Booth was seen in the middle of the
floor leaning upon a crutch which he now
threw aside, and grasping a carbine he
limped towards the door. Serjeant Corbett,
who had crept up to the barn, now fired
through an aperture, the shot taking effect
in the head of Booth, who fell to the floor.
The soldiers then entered the barn and re-
moved the then dying man to the porch of
an adjoining house, and Colonel Conger at
once sent for a surgeon. Booth was at first
insensible, but finally revived a little, and
said to Colonel Conger in a feeble voice,
"Tell mother I die for my country; I did
what I thought was for the best." When
an effort was made to revive him by bath-
ing his hands and face with water, he ut-
tered the words, "Useless, useless!" and
soon afterwards expired. He was shot at
fifteen minutes past three A. M., and died
about four hours afterwards. His body was
conveyed to Washington, and is said to
have been fully identified and secretly
buried, being first merely sewed up in an
army blanket. The post mortem examin-
ation of Booth's body showed that the ball
did not touch the brain, but striking the
spinal column produced immediate paral-
ysis. The opinion of the surgeon is that he
must have died a horrible death, the brain
being active and consciousness complete
up to the very moment of his death.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nearly all the parties directly implicated
are now in custody. Payne, the would-be
assassin of Secretary Seward, is a brother
of the St. Alban's raider. There are six
brothers, all reckless and daring fellows.
Two were with Walker in Nicaragua.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Harold has so far been quite reticent and
morose. His trial is to take place imme-
diately.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lewis Payne, the man who attacked
Secretary Seward, is now in gaol in Wash-
ington. He recently attempted to beat his
brains out against the iron bars of his cell.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}but was prevented; securely bound, and his
head encased in a wadded cap, in order to
prevent any similar attempt at self destruc-
tion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Booth seems to have been the animating
spirit of the whole affair (writes a New
York correspondent), and there is no doubt
that he entertained a plot of the kind fully
six months before he dealt the fatal blow.
A young man of magnificent address, and
imbued with unmistakable love for the
South, his fascinating manner enabled him
to make friends by the score in the Con-
federate families of Lower Maryland, and
he beat about this portion of the State for
months before carrying his plot into execu-
tion. His extensive acquaintance, and his
ready knowledge of human nature, enabled
him to pitch upon the right persons for as-
sociates. As originally contemplated, it is
unquestionable that he intended to im-
mortalise his name by the kidnapping of
the President: and as assistants in the de-
velopment of this idea many persons joined
the conspiracy who would not have done
so had they known that murder might grow
out of it, but who will now go to the gal-
lows. To seize the President and Cabinet
and hurry them into the South, was to se-
cure for the bold and successful adventurers
a lasting fame, and make them the heroes
of the war, and it is no wonder that Booth
found men ready to embrace this daring
idea. To carry out this plan a house was
rented in Washington. The cellars of this
house were transformed into secure dun-
geons, well provided with manacles, and
finally the building, it is stated, was mined,
so that if success in kidnapping was over-
turned at the last moment, the captured
party might be blown up. I can hardly
believe this last statement true; but how-
ever that may be, it is now made pretty
clear that the co-conspirators were not in-
formed that the actual murder of the Pre-
sident was contemplated until just before
the occurrence. On the night of the assas-
sination, it is said, a party of strangers sud-
denly collected about the audience door of
the theatre, and at precisely fifteen minutes
before ten, one of them called out, in a sub-
dued voice, though not in a whisper, "Nine
o'clock and forty-five minutes." This was
taken up and repeated by others stationed
at various points between the audience
door and the street. In five minutes more
the person who had first spoken said "Nine
o'clock and fifty minutes," and this was
caught up and repeated as before. At in-
tervals of five minutes the time was called
until ten minutes past ten o'clock, when
the hour having been named, the whole
party scattered, just as John Wilkes Booth
entered the President's box. In thirty
seconds Booth was riding away from the
rear of the theatre. Strange, incomprehen-
sible as this proceeding may appear, I am
informed, by one who should know the
precise truth in the matter that it did act-
ually take place. Booth's principal assist-
ant seems to have been Mrs. Surratt, a wo-
man of considerable property, formerly re-
siding on her own farm at Surrattsville,
Maryland, but more recently living at
Washington. She it was who made ar-
rangements for the reception of Booth af-
ter the murder; and to her hotel, kept by
one John Tyler, at Surrattsville, Booth and
his companion, Harrold, went for refresh-
ment and arms immediately upon the com-
mission of the deed, it being their first
stopping-place. Harrold, who was with
Booth when the latter was discovered and
shot, and who is now waiting trial at Wash-
ington, is a smooth-faced, silly boy. He
was selected as an accomplice because of
his excellent knowledge of country and to-
pography, and for his accomplishments as
a rider, boatman, and pistol shot. He com-
mitted no actual deed of blood, but his
death upon the gallows is inevitable.{{< /news/text >}}

Andrew Johnson's Speech on
the Fall of Richmond-—Death to
the Leading Traitors.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Upon the reception in Washington of
the news of the fall of Richmond, on the
5th inst. Vice President Johnson was
serenaded by the jubilant people, and made
a speech to them of great force and power,
in which he laid down the treatment he
conceived to be proper for the rebel leaders
and masses. In view of Mr. Lincoln's un-
timely death, and Mr. Johnson's succession
as President of the United States, the re-
marks then delivered have a double inter-
est and meaning. We reproduce the speech,
and the terms laid down in it will undoubt-
edly be the policy of the new President:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"You must indulge me in making one
single remark in connection with myself.
At the time the traitors in the Senate of
the United States plotted against the Gov-
ernment and entered into a conspiracy more
execrable, and more odious than that of
Cataline against the Romans, I happened
to be a member of that body, and, as to
loyalty, stood solitary and alone among the
Senators from the Southern States.-—I
was then and there called upon to know
what I would do with such traitors, and I
want to repeat my reply. I said, if we
had an Andrew Jackson he would hang
them as high as Haman.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"But as he is no more, and sleeps in his
grave in his own beloved State, where
traitors and treason have even insulted his
tomb and the very earth that covers his
remains, humble as I am, when you ask me
what I would do, my reply is, I would ar-
rest them; I would try them; I would con-
vict them, and I would hang them. As
humble as I am and have been, I have
pursued but one undeviating course. All
that I have-—life, limb and property-—have
been put at the disposal of the country in
this great struggle. I have been in camp,
I have been in the field, I have been every-
where where this great rebellion was; I
have pursued it until I believe I can now
see its termination. Since the world began
there never has been a rebellion of such
gigantic proportions, so infamous in char-
acter, so diabolical in motive, so entirely
disregardful of the laws of civilized war.
It has introduced the most savage mode of
warfare ever practiced upon the earth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I will repeat here a remark, for which I
have been in no small degree censured.
What is it, allow me to ask, that has sus-
tained the nation in this great struggle?
The cry has been you know, that our
Government was not strong enough for a
time of rebellion; that in such a time she
would have to contend against internal
weakness as well as internal foes. We have
now given the world evidence that such is
not the fact; and when the rebellion shall
have been crushed out, and the nation shall
once again have settled down in peace, our
Government will rest upon a more enduring
basis than ever before.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"But my friends, in what has the great
strength of this Government consisted!
Has it been in one-man power! Has it
been in some autocrat, or in some one
man who held absolute government! No!
I thank God I have it in my power to pro-
claim the great truth that this Government
has derived its strength from the American
people. They have issued the edict; they
have exercised the power that has resulted
in the overthrow of the rebellion, and there
is not another Government upon the face
of the earth that could have withstood the
shock. We can now congratulate ourselves
that we possess the strongest, the freest,
and the best Government the world ever
saw.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Thank God that we have lived through
this trial, and that, looking in your intel-
ligent faces here, to-day, I can announce to
you the great fact that Petersburg, the
outpost of the strong citadel, has been oc-
cupied by our brave and gallant officers,
and our untiring, invincible soldiers. And
not content with that they have captured
the citadel itself, the stronghold of the
traitors. Richmond is ours, and is now
occupied by the forces of the United States!
Death to the conspirators—clemency to
their victims. One word more, and I have
done. It is this; I am in favor of leniency;
but, in my opinion, evil-doers should be
punished. Treason is the highest crime
known in the catalogue of crimes; and for
him that in guilty of it—for him that is
willing to lift his impious hand against the
authority of the nation—I would say, death
is too easy a punishment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"My notion is that treason must be made
odious, that traitors must be punished and
impoverished, their social power broken,
though they must be made to feel the pen-
alty of their crimes. Hence I say this—-
the halter to intelligent, influential traitors.
But to the honest boy, to the deluded man,
who has been deceived into the rebel ranks,
I would extend leniency. I would say,
return to your allegiance, renew your sup-
port to the Government, and become a good
citizen; but the leaders I would hang. I
hold, too, that wealthy traitors should be
made to remunerate those men who have
suffered as a consequence of their crimes.—-
Union men who have lost their property,
who have been driven from their homes,
beggars, and wanderers among strangers.
It is well to talk about things here to-day,
in addressing the well-informed persons
who compose this audience. You can, to
a very great extent, aid in moulding public
opinion, and in giving it proper direction.
Let us commence the work. We have put
down these traitors in arms; let us put
them down in law, in public judgment
and in the morals of the world."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}New York, May 6.—-President Johnson
has issued the following proclamation:—-
"Whereas it appears from evidence in the
bureau of the Military Department that Mr.
Lincoln's murder and Mr. Seward's attempt-
ed assassination were incited, concerted,
and procured by Jefferson Davis, Jacob
Thompson, Clement C. Clay, Beverley
Tucker, George N. Sanders, W. C. Cleary,
and other rebel traitors against the United
States Government, harboured in Canada;
the following rewards for the arrest of the
said persons within the limits of the United
States are therefore offered;—-$100,000 for
Davis, $10,000 for Cleary, and $25,000
for each for the others." Cleary against
whom the Toronto grand jury found a true
bill for a breach of the neutrality laws,
has surrendered. He gave bail for $8,000
and will stand his trial at the October as-
sizes. Beverley, Tucker, and Cleary have
written letters denying positively having
had any knowledge of a plot to assassinate
or capture Lincoln and Seward. George
N. Sanders and Tucker have issued a ma-
nifesto accusing President Johnson of a
hellish plot to murder their Christian Pres-
ident. They express their readiness to
proceed to Rouse's Point or some other
place for trial if the Federal Government
will pay for their defence and guarantee
their safety. It is understood that a formal
demand has been made upon the Canadian
Government to surrender such of the as-
sassination conspirators as may be within
its jurisdiction. The Montreal Gazette
believes that Surratt, who had arrived in
Canada, had left that country. General
Ewell and several other Confederate gener-
als have addressed a letter to Grant, ex-
pressing their unqualified abhorrence and
indignation at Lincoln's murder and
Seward's attempted assassination, and de-
claring themselves to be no allies of assass-
ins, either North or South. Jefferson
Davis, Breckenridge, Benjamin, and other
Confederate leaders, escorted by 2,000
cavalry, and followed by eleven waggons,
supposed to contain treasure, reached
Yorkville, South Carolina, on the 28th.
Stoneman's cavalry arrived at the town on
the following day, Mr. Davis thus having
one day's start. Governor Aiken, of South
Carolina, and C B Lamar, of Savannah,
have arrived at Washington as prisoners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is asserted that they will be regularly
tried on the charge of treason. It is report-
ed that an agreement has been make far the
surrender of all the Confederate troops in
Florida. It is also reported that Canby
will only accept Dick Taylor's surrender
on the same terms as those accepted by
General Lee. Mosby has left Virginia,
and is endeavoring to escape to Texas.
Sherman's entire army has arrived at
Washington, and he has established his
head-quarters at Alexandria. Rosser is
stated to have been captured. Jefferson
Thompson has surrendered. An adver-
tisement is published in the Washington
papers requesting officers and soldiers
wishing to emigrate to Mexico, according
to the Mexican decree, to register their
names and address with Colonel A. J. M.
at Washington. Other offices for the same
object will be opened in all the large cities
of the Union. The New York Herald
says that a scheme is on foot to enable all
those who desire to sustain the Monroe
doctrine to do so without involving them-
selves or the Government in trouble. The
New York Herald devotes six columns to
a description of the Fenian Brotherhood,
estimating their strength in Ireland at
65,000. In connection therewith the Herald
inquires what England proposes doing in
reference to the conspirators in Canada,
and the claims for damages by privateers.
Governor Aiken is on parole at Washing-
ton.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Secretary of the Treasury has re-
moved the trade restrictions in Delaware,
Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Western Vir-
ginia; and the Government is said to be
debating these restrictions in the Southern
States. The New York Chamber of Com-
merce has passed resolutions in favour of
clemency and magnanimity towards the
South. Mr. Wendell Phillips advocates a
similar policy. General Halleck has issued
an order allowing all persons, without re-
gard to rank or employment in the civil or
military service of the rebel Government,
to take the oath of allegiance and be
amnestied, receiving a corresponding certifi-
cate. Those who may be excluded from
the benefit of the oath can apply to the Ex-
ecutive for pardon. Their taking the oath
voluntarily will constitute a claim on the
clemency of the Executive. President John-
son made speech to the Pennsylvania de-
legation, reiterating that the severest pen-
alties of the law would be inflicted upon
the rebel leaders. President Lincoln's re-
mains were interred at Springfield, on the
4th inst. The Boston Advertiser says that
Booth's head and heart were removed from
his remains and deposited in the medical
museum Washington. The body was inter-
red in the felons' cemetery. Mr. Simeon
Draper has telegraphed that only 5,000 bales
of cotton have been found in Charleston,
Gold; on the morning of the 6th 143.{{< /news/text >}}

To The Editor of the Bangkok Recorder.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir—-The article published in your issue
of June 16th 1865, under the head of
"Robbery," contains statements prejudicial
to the character of Mr. Moor the Portuguese
Consul, which I feel require some explana-
tion from me in order to disabuse the pub-
lic mind as to the spirit of my expressions.
While stating that Mr Moor had not fairly
adjudicated the case and appeared to take
the part of Fonseca the defendant, I was
viewing the matter as if it had been brought
before a Siamese tribunal, when his pilfer-
ing, although not prosecuted by me in the
charge I made against him before the
Consul, yet if there had been sufficient
grounds to convince one of the fact, would
have been taken cognizance of, and he would
have been punished, as if the whole of his
delinquencies had been brought forward and
clearly proved against him.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/indent2 >}}Your Obt. Servant

{{< news/indent3 >}}PLAINTIFF in the case of

{{< news/text >}}Not being conversant with the proceed-
ings in European Courts of Justice, I was
betrayed into making use of expressions
detrimental to Mr. Moor's reputation for
integrity, and which I sincerely regret, the
more so, as Mr. Moor has been a friend of
mine for upwards of ten years, and has
always, won my esteem for his upright and
impartial conduct, and I should be very
sorry if my communication cast any slur on
the honor of this gentleman. I beg you
will give this letter early publication as I
am anxious to make all the "amende hon-

Tour to the Hot Springs.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 110.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Being exceedingly weary we laid our-
selves down to sleep each in his own chos-
en berth quickly after dinner, having pre-
viously arranged to resume our journey at
break of day the next morning. We felt it
to be a real luxury to lie there in the open
and balmy air on our blankets without the
necessity of musqueto bars. At the close
of my last article I alluded to the great
amount of dignity we five travelers pos-
sessed in our combined professions, and
the power we consequently had to impart
a vast and lasting importance to the place
in which we had taken up our lodging.
But I cannot flatter myself that we ac-
complished much in this way, when I re-
flect what an undignified appearance we
must have made sprawling about on the
floor of the Inn, locked up in sleep, lying
heads and points and every other direction.
Why, one of our clerical fraternity, in or-
der to get rid of the ants, whose legions
came trooping over him after he had laid
down to sleep, even took to the table and
there he lay snoring lustily and thus lord-
ing it over us much of the night.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Before loosing myself in sleep I over-
head our worthy host giving orders to his
servants, to kill four or five of his best
fowls, and make them ready for us by the
next morning, and that several of them
should take good care of our horses and
oxen all the night, giving as reasons the
fact that the Governor of Petchaburee had
sent such instructions, and that we were
all very weary.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have omitted to mention in its pro-
per place that I had, before dinner, a con-
versation with the Karen chief on religious
topics, and was happy to learn that he had
been somewhat informed of the doings of
the Baptist missionaries among the Karens
in Burmah, and had learned several of the
elementary lessons of christianity. He
was quite intent upon having me talk to
him and his people about Christ, and to
obtain some christian tracts. I was glad
to give him a little talk on that great sub-
ject and to present him a few portions of
the Bible and other smaller tracts which
we had brought along with us. He and
his men spoke the Siamese language
about as well as their own mother tongue.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}March 15th. We all arose at 3 o'clock
A. M. happy to find that our sick companion
had had a very comfortable night, and was
feeling quite well and ready to advance
to the terminus of our journey. But to
guard against another paroxysm of fever,
he took a third dose of quinine. Another
of our party began to complain sadly of
gastric derangement, so that our antici-
pated pleasures for the day were dampened
a little for a wholesome check upon our
spirits. We took a lunch and mounted
our ponies at 6 o'clock, leaving our com-
missaries with all his luggage to await there
our return in the evening. We took with us
only a small box of eatables, which the chief
arranged to have two of his servants swing
on a pole and carry for us to the Springs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We had a charming ride of 10 miles or
more until 9½ A M. We rode slowly in
order to enjoy the charming scenery as
well as to accomodate ourselves to the
soreness each one had brought on himself
by the long ride of the previous day. The sun
became rather oppressive ere we reached
our destination, and made some of us regret
that we had started so late, loosing the en-
chanting moonlight and the delightful
morning breese. Our road was mainly
a cart track—passing now through a wil-
derness of bananas—now in a forest of the
most beautiful kind of bamboo called p'ai
p'ak, quite free from under brush and ar-
ranged by nature in clumps, but each tree
apparently independent of its neighbor.
Presently we were ascending a tract of
upland, occupied here by the teng rang
tree, and there by various varieties of lof-
tier trees among which the lowly Sapan
wood was quite abundant. This is strong-
ly marked by the multitude of small pro-
tuberances or warts on its bark. The tree
is uniformly small; the tallest being not
more than 20 feet high, and 6 inches in
diameter a foot from the ground. The
Karens were heard and seen here and there
chopping down Sapan trees, and preparing
them for market by shaving off the bark
from the sticks. They usually cut up the
trees by the roots leaving the bulb which
grows just beneath the ground, attached
to the sticks, as that is accounted the best
part of the tree for dying purposes. The
coloring properties of the Sapanwood are
much like that of the Logwood but not
as strong
The Karen woodmen are allowed to
cut timber where they please in all those
forests, and free of duty. The land ap-
pears to be owned only by government, the
natives being permitted to squat down and
and make little settlements in the wilder-
ness as they please. They sell their Sapan
wood chiefly to the Laocians, who come
for it with ox carts, and pay for it in rice
or other merchandise at the rate of about
one Tical per picul. The carmen take
it a journey of two days or more to Rat-
booree, about three piculs to the load, and
sell it there usually for two Ticals a picul.
Those second hand purchasers carry it to
Bangkok in large boats of 100 piculs or
more and sell it for 2½ to 3 Ticals per picul.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Ever and anon we emerged from a dense
forest into small clearings, some of which
were old and some new, and here and there
one with all the logs and brush ready for
a fallow burning. Some of the old clear-
ings were occupied with the Cotton plant,
the pods of which had all burst, and were
beautifully white, and apparently suffering
for the want of persons to gather it. We
clipped a few twigs from the tallest stalks
as we rode along, and found it to have a
staple that would compare well with the
best kinds of the article of the great and
most powerful family to which it belongs.
I held a sprig of the pods in my hand a
long time, being compelled, as it were, al-
most to reverence it as a representative of
a power which clothes the human race, and
has, for nearly four years, by the pride and
arrogance of man, made the world to shake
from centre to circumference.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have since been informed that those
wild Karens, having learned that Cotton
would bear a good price in market, laid
themselves out much more than usual the
last year to produce it. But that——
(not the noble P. P. whom European re-
sidents so generally know and so highly
esteem) in his great greed, sent his servants
among them, and taxed the article so heav-
ily that they became discouraged, and
abandoned their new enterprise.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The latter part of our way was merely
a narrow foot path passing now over moun-
tain ridges, now down into deep and dark
glens, becoming more and more romantic
as we advanced. We crossed a deep
ravine, then mostly dry, some eight or ten
times. One of the most charming places
upon it is called Pa'p'tung, where rocks
stand up with wonderful uprightness and
grandeur, and hence the name. Near this
place is a Karen village called by the same
name. These houses are remarkable for
being built, as it were on, high and slender
stilts, with only a small ladder for an en-
trance at each, which we were told are
drawn up every night to guard against the
ingress of tigers. Their dwellings are very
slightly built, being roofed and sided with
grass. At each corner outside are two
bamboo braces standing at an angle of 45
degrees with one end in the ground, the
other made fast to the floor joice near the
corners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We had frequent evidences that we were
among wild elephants and wild hogs. The
Rhinoceros lives in those woods, and a
young one was caught there not long be-
fore; but we were not so favored as to see
even the track of one. Tigers are said to
be numerous there. But we made too
much noise in passing their domains, to get
a sight of any, or of even any wild animal
excepting a few fowls and monkeys. But
the gentlemen hunters who had started
from P. all armed to the teeth for a hunt
of the most exciting and daring kind, had
very strangely forgotten to bring their
guns with them from the Karen village.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As we drew near the Hot-springs we
ascended a long acclivity, and then descend-
ed into a kind of cove which was nearly
surrounded by highlands, indicating per-
haps, that it might once have been a vol-
canic crater. We found it but a sorry
place for a stay of from seven to eight
hours in a fearfully hot day; for there was
not the least sign of a human habitation, or
even a sala or shed to be seen, or any other
evidence that man had ever visited the
place. The trees about it were chiefly
small leafless bamboos. The few larger
trees had been greatly thinned of their
leaves, and it was the most difficult thing
to find one that offered us any relief what-
ever from the powerful sun which beat
terribly upon us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Weary and scorched as we were, we
sought without delay for the true sources
of the hot water, which we found every
where in the marsh. At length we found one
of the springs covered with old leaves and
logs, and among brush that defied our ap-
proach by the terrible hooks with which
they were armed. But we presently over-
came them, and cleared out one of the
springs, so that we had the great pleasure
of seeing the water literally boiling up out
of a lime stone rock as clear as crystal.
But it was remarkable that it boiled at the
temperature of 130 of Fahrenheit instead
of 212 according to the coarse of nature.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why, we could almost fancy that we
had come into the neighborhood of a sub-
terranean world, subject to laws of which
mankind on the outside of the shell know
nothing.{{< /news/text >}}
