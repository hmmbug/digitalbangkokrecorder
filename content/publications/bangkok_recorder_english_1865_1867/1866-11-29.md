Latest.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Before changing her residence at
Hanover for the chateau of Hildesheim,
Queen Mary, the spouse of the dethron-
ed George, received a deputation from
the town, who came to console with the
royal sufferer. On this occasion the
queen accounted for her husband's per-
sistent opposition to Prussia by telling
the astonished citizens that the king had
often had revelations from on high grant-
ed to him in the watches of the night.
It was after one such divine command
that he resolved to hold out to the last,
even at the risk of a war. The religious
enthusiasm of the queen seems to be
equally intense with that of the king,
who had no hesitation in asserting with
his own royal lips, some time ago, that
the same hour in which he ascended the
throne the spirit of God had descended
upon him, and fitted him to rule in its
stead. "In the primary scheme of crea-
tion," he added, "the existence and re-
gal might of the Guelphs was already
determined upon. Their sway, therefore,
would last till the end of all time, to the
honour of God and the well-being of
their subjects."{{< /news/text >}}

France.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We derive the following from the let-
ter of a Paris correspondent, dated Oct. 8.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are rumours of a diplomatic
rupture between Prussia and Austria in
case the latter Power shall persist in its
intentions of appointing M. de Beust
Minister of Foreign Affairs. If Austria
persists a renewal of war is upon the
cards.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The insanity of the Empress of Mex-
ico, now (in spite of a contradiction of
the 'Patrie' not persisted in) universally
spoken of, appeared in the form of a be-
lief that there was a conspiracy to poi-
son her, and that her life would only be
safe under the personal protection of
the Pope! This explains her journey to
Rome; and there her madness broke out
in a manner so contrary to Papal eti-
quette that the Holy Father was forced
to hand her over to the mad doctors.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Empress of Mexico is the sub-
ject of much conversation here. Yes-
terday morning at 9, without having re-
quested audience, she presented herself
at the Vatican to see the Holy Father.
She was immediately received, and it is
said she presented a petition to the Pope
praying his holiness to sanction every-
thing that her husband had done as em-
peror with respect to religious matters.
The story goes that the Pope positively
refused, and that the empress then de-
clared she would not leave the Vatican
if her request were not granted. I can-
not guarantee the authority of all this;
but it is certain the empress did not quit
the Vatican until 6 in the evening. She
retired to the private study of the Pope,
and his holiness continued his ordinary
audiences; he afterwards dined alone,
according to etiquette, and went out for
his usual drive, leaving the empress with
her lady in waiting. She at length left,
and dined at the Hotel de Rome, where
her majesty is staying. In consequence
of this incident a rumour has got abroad
that her reason is impaired, and we know
beyond and doubt that Professor Viale,
the Pope's medical attendant, scarcely
leaves her.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We find the following in the Paris
correspondence of the 'Globe':—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a diplomatic quarter I learn that
Russia really is (as intimated in a pre-
vious letter) extremely vexed at finding
that France and England are determined
not to allow the Eastern question to be
opened for the present. She had laid
her plans in the expectation that it could
not fail to come on the tapis, and it was
on account of this that she feasted the
United States' delegates, and "engur-
landed" them (a Russian expression)
with flowers of eloquence. And now all
goes for nothing. No wonder she is an-
noyed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A new manifestation of the ill-feeling
which the sudden and unexpected ag-
grandisement of Prussia has occasioned
in France is now taking place. It con-
sists in the handing about of photographs,
entitled "What the war has cost Prussia,
and bearing apparently only rows of fig-
ures, but which, on being held up to the
light, present words grossly insulting to
the Prussian sovereign. People are also
much amused by a figure of an irate
Austrian soldier holding Bismarck by the
ears, and to which the pulling of a string
gives the comic resemblance of the states-
man being rudely shaken by the warrior.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These undoubtedly are very puerile
things, but as an indication of prevailing
sentiment they are significant. I am told
too that the conjurors and mountebanks
who give exhibitions in streets and
squares fill their ROOSTMENTS—(the non-
sensical speeches with which they attract
and amuse crowds) with scoffing allusions
to Count Bismarck and the Prussians.
Some of them even figure in grotesque
imitations of the Prussian helmets. As
these Demostheneses of the gutter are
closely watched by the police, it is pro-
bable that they have been "inspired" to
speak as they do; at all events it is clear
that they are tolerated.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}We have received the following interest-
ing letter from a Missionary friend at
Tientain :-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
TIENTSIN, 14TH OCTOBER,
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}MR EDITOR-—I hope you will deem the
following account of sufficient interest to
insert in your paper. Many will read and
rejoice, while others will wonder and doubt
whether these things are so. I propose to
furnish a simple statement of facts, as un-
derstood or heard of here.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}About last February an aged stranger
was seen in one of the principal streets
inside the walls of this city, enquiring
where information relating to the Roman
Catholic Religion, could be obtained. He
was directed by some one to the Protestant
chapel in care of the English Methodist
new connection mission, located by the
tower in the centre of the city. He ea-
gerly sought the place ; the native assistant
who preached that day discoursed on the
Beatitudes, dwelling especially on the
Blessedness of the pure in heart, because
they shall see God, Matt. Chap. 5th verse
8th. The stranger felt and manifested
great joy on hearing such sentiments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He subsequently made the following re-
markable statements:—He lived in the
township of Lau Lang in the province of
Shangtung, distant from Tientsain 450 li,
and about 7 or 8 li from the southern
boundary of Chili province. His age was
68 years. Some months previous, he had
been taken down with disease, and be-
lieved that he was soon to die. He felt
that he was unprepared to die and that he
was a very great sinner. He became very
much depressed in mind in view of his
sins. He could find no rest and satisfac-
tion. One night he dreamed that he was
conducted away by a superior and beauti-
ful being to the outer gate of a most mag-
nificent palace. He had never seen or
heard anything so grand and so enchan-
tingly beautiful. He looked in, and saw
that it was full of light and splendor, and
that inside were many such beings as was
his conductor, who seemed to be very hap-
py. On his endeavouring to enter, he was
told that such as he was were not permit-
ted to enter. No unclean and vile person
was allowed within. The great difference
between himself and those inside was
pointed out to him. He was told that he
was not to die for some time to come, and
if he became pure and clean, after death
he could enter the palace and join in its
pursuits.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He awoke full of astonishment, and for
a long time, remained absorbed in the con-
templation of his dream, but could not un-
derstand its meaning. Full of ardent long-
ing to understand it, he at length fell
asleep again, and dreamed substantially
the same dream.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the morning he told his dream to his
friends, but could find no one who could
give any satisfactory explanation. He
soon recovered from his illness, but his
distress of mind found no relief, but rath-
er increased in view of the vision. It oc-
curred to him after a while that in his
neighbourhood were some Roman Catho-
lics (Chinese). He went to them, explained
his feelings and told his dream. They
were utterly unable to answer his in-
quiries, but told him that at Tientsain there were
Roman Catholics who could give him in-
struction. He without delay started for
this city, and was directed to the Protes-
tant chapel above referred to.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His story and his manifest earnestness
and sincerity attracted considerable interest
at the time. He spent several weeks here
attending the chapel services, reading
Christian books, and learning all he could
regarding the new doctrines, which he
joyfully received. He finally returned
home carrying some Christian books with
him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He appeared at Tientsin again, after se-
veral weeks, with a letter signed by a num-
ber of his neighbours and friends who had
become deeply interested in the books he
had taken home, and in the statements he
made relating to what he had previously
learned at Tientsin. The letter contained
a request for a native christian to go to
Lou Ling and explain the books more ful-
ly. It stated also that there was a con-
siderable number who were very desirous
of receiving instruction and that the in-
terest was widening.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In accordance with this request, the me-
thodist mission sent back with the old
gentlemen a supply of books and some of
their native assistants. The latter was al-
sent about a month, and on his return he
gave very interesting and wonderful details
of the serious and profound attachment of
a comparatively large number to the new
truths, the "glad tidings." Soon after-
wards two colporteurs were sent to Lou
Lang who spent a month there, distribut-
ing books and giving instruction. They
confirmed on their return previous ac-
counts, and bore an invitation for some
foreign missionary to go and administer
baptism to those who on examination
should be judged prepared for it. But as
one of the two members of the methodist
mission was then absent at Shanghai it
was not at all convenient for the other
member to leave Tientsin for the necessary
time. A native preacher and his wife,
were sent instead of a foreign missionary.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 4th of September, one of the
missionaries started for the place. In nine
or ten days he sent back to his associate
intelligence of such an interesting and en-
couraging nature, more than confirming
the previous statements made by the
Chinese, that the latter started for Lou
Ling, to assist in the work of examining
and baptizing. They both returned, on the
29th ultimo.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I will briefly state some items of inter-
est they have made known.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They have baptized after a very careful
and prayerful examination 45 persons, of
whom 18 are women and 27 are men.
There are several tens' more, a good pro-
portion of whom are females, who desire
baptism. The village where the principal
interest is, named after the family clan, of
whom the old gentlemen who came to
Tientsin is the head, is not large. It is
surrounded on all sides by similar villages
distant from each other only a few Li.
The interest extends in all directions, some
come on Saturday afternoon for 20, 30 and
even 40 and more Li, bringing their bed-
ding and their food, to attend the Sabbath
services, returning home Sabbath P. M. af-
ter the second preaching service. One old
man aged 72, living 45 Li distant was
heard to say that if the foreign teachers
could afford to come 450 Li, he could af-
ford to come 45 Li, and so he walks that
distance Saturday afternoon, to hear
preaching.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The native helper, before the foreign
missionaries had arrived, one Sabbath re-
marked publicly on the duty of destroying
every idol and instrument of idolatry
and superstition. On the following day
17 families brought their images, pictures,
kc., every thing they had which pertained
to idolatrous worship, and burned them
up in the presence of the native helper.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Sabbath seems to be observed with
considerable propriety and strictness in
regard to some things. For example, the
Chinese Christians of their own accord
have made a rule which is carefully ob-
served, that among those who meet to-
gether for worship, and with those who
remain during the intermission on the
Sabbath, preparing and eating their re-
freshments, there shall be no secular topic
introduced and discussed, nothing relating
to cultivating the soil, or gathering the
crops &c. The village and the country
around it being inhabited chiefly by farm-
ers, and those who attend the meetings
being themselves farmers, or laboring on
farms, this rule, it is manifest, is a prac-
tical one, and shows the sincerity and
earnestness of the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Christians living in the village go
to their work on the neighbouring farms,
early in the morning; after breakfast a-
bout 9 o'clock, they assemble at the chapel,
for singing, reading the scriptures and
prayer, for half an hour, and then proceed
to their work again. In the evening, after
supper, they meet in the chapel for prayer
&c. again.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The women who believe are, as may be
inferred from the fact that they have been
already baptised, not nearly as reserved
and retiring, as respectable Chinese fe-
males usually are. They meet for service
oftentimes in the same building with the
men, and seem very desirous of hearing
the Gospel preached themselves. The wife
of the native helper now there has had a
great and salutary influence among the
women. Sometimes 20 or 30 women will
bring what needle and other light work
they have to her house, and sit and work,
while she reads the scriptures and explains
the Bible to them. Several of them are
able to read.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Christians are represented as pray-
ing with fervency and propriety, as engag-
ing in singing hymns, if not with a strict
compliance with the rules of music, with a
deal of enjoyment and animation, with the
spirit, if not with the understanding. They
have what cannot be said generally of na-
tive church members in China, an affecting
and profound sense of their personal sin-
fulness and unworthiness. They have an
ardent desire for the conversion of their
own families, or neighbours, who are still
unconverted. This desire manifests itself
in their present public prayers, and in their
daily conversation and conduct.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Perhaps I have been too minute and too
lengthy respecting this religious move-
ment in Lou Ling, unprecedented so far
as China is concerned, but I could not con-
clude to leave out any of the facts stated.
I leave the subject here, requesting the
reader to remember that the work was
commenced and carried on till less than
one month ago, without the presence
of a foreign missionary, and that previous
to last spring not one in Lou Ling knew
any thing about the Bible or the Doctrines
of the Bible as explained by Protestant
missionaries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The future will tell more perfectly than
we now know the real nature and extent
of the work. It appears to be an extensive
and genuine turning from Idolatry to the
worship of the true God.—-OVERLAND CHI-

The Royal Outlook
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have quite recently been put in
possession of a curious paper from the
pen of one of His Majesty's chief scribes,
which we think the most of our read-
ers will be interested in reading. The
following is a free translation of it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The question whether President
Johnson, chief ruler of the U. States
of America is a man worthy of being
praised or is a man of evil deeds, and
has been falsely praised, does not yet
fully appear to the Siamese. The
king of Siam did not know his name
or his character before his inaugura-
tion as President. He only respected
the station to which he was promoted,
as the U. S. and Siam are in treaty re-
lations, being friendly to each other.
And it is according to international law
that the Am. Consul should protect
those Americans who come hither to
live and to trade in Siam, and to see
that they all live according to the stip-
ulations of the Treaty, guarding them-
selves against all acts that should be
avoided, and that would unnecessarily
produce collision."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"With regard to having any particu-
lar affection for the President of the
U. S. the king of Siam can only do it
as a kind of half way concern; and
such must be his regard toward the
Presidents of the U. S. who have pre-
ceded Mr. Johnson, because the king
can never know them intimately—-not
having known them at all before their
accession."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And as regards the election of the
Presidents from time to time, the king
of course has no concern in it. But
whenever he hears that a good man
has been elected, and that the people
are happy in him, the king becomes
also happy for the same reason, think-
ing that the man has been a good man
from former time. But on the other
hand, the king is never angered be-
cause a President does not prove to be
quite the man that pleases him, as he
has no concern in the election of the
Presidents. Hence the virtues and the
faults of any President do not parti-
cularly concern the king of Siam, to
speak or even to think of.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nevertheless because the newspa-
pers have published from time to time
news from the U. S. for the purpose of
interesting the Siamese—that when
they have read they may converse
together on the subject, and when they
find that the news is better than it was
thought it would be, they may re-
joiced in it, [the king has been
led to think a good deal about the
Presidents.]
The reports that were made of the
assassination of President Lincoln
were made according to what appeared
the facts in the case, and praises were
lavished on President Johnson in mul-
tiplied ways. But the circumstance
of his getting intoxicated with spirits
at the time of his inauguration, were
so public that the newspapers could
not conceal them. They were obliged
to report the facts as they were, and
then they labored to apologize for
them. What was said in the papers
of the affairs, the king understood, and
had at that time doubts in his mind
whether President Johnson was not a
bad man. The king feared that Prest.
Johnson might have a hasty spir-
it-—being impetuous in his desires of
the honors of the Presidency—-not
willing to wait four years when he
might have a chance of being regular-
ly elected to that station, and therefore
ventured to drive the affair to a quick
consummation; and that possibly he
might be implicated in the crime of
assassinating President Lincoln. It
appeared to the king, at the time, not
probable that the rebel leaders were
accessory to the assassination, because
they were already conquered, and it
was not Prest. Lincoln alone who stood
in the way of their rising again to pow-
er, but the government. Or that if
the rebels were accessory to the assas-
sination perhaps they were so because
they were convinced that if Prest. Lin-
coln remained, the Union cause would
become so strong against them as to
leave no hope of ever rallying again:
but that if Prest. Lincoln were gone the
government would of course devolve
on Vice Prest. Johnson who perhaps
would not be likely so to rule as to
preserve the strength and power of the
government, and might lead to a rup-
ture between him and Congress, and
thus open the way for the rebels to
recover their power. Hence foreace-
ing such probable results they may
have been accessory to the assassination.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now such were the cogitations of
the king at the beginning, and he was
not hence much disposed to credit
the praises published in the newspaper
concerning President Johnson. He
thinks it likely these his views of the
affair as published formerly were not
pleasing to the editors of the papers.
But now it appears that the papers
have changed their oppinion, and ex-
press the fear that President Johnson
is really a bad man, and assert that
he is becoming unpopular with the
people of the U. S. The king is
hence rather gratified than otherwise
to find that he was quite correct in
regard to his fears of the character
of President Johnson from the be-
ginning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now in all that has been said a-
bove the king has no political motive
whatever. The news of political mat-
ters and others in the U. S. he is not
much concerned with. He is only
concerned to have the editors of the
papers know that the affairs of the
U. S. as published here in Siam will
be read with interest by but a few
Siamese in the normal state of the
country, and will be passed over by
most of the readers of the newspapers
because that country is far away
and Siam has but little buisiness with
it. But the king has had the thoughts
as above expressed, in consideration
of the treaty of amity and friend-
ship which exists between the U. S.
and Siam, and not by any means be-
cause of any personal considerations,
and that for the reason that he has
had no personal knowledge of either
of the Presidents.{{< /news/text >}}

Sandwish Island No. 7.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In our last No. we gave the statis-
tics of the members of the Protestant
Churches on the Islands. We purpose
now to show the character of those
members. The book of Dr. Anderson,
from which we draw our information
is full of the most reliable testimony
to the genuineness of the work of grace
wrought in the hearts of tens of thou-
sands of those islanders, and the great-
ness and the blessedness of the change
it has produced in their lives. The
following address of a senior deacon
of the church of WAIMEA, a native of
the island of Hawaii, will, we think,
be interesting to some of our readers,
if not to all, as it shows in a striking
light what the people themselves
think of the work of the missionaries
and how highly they prize it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The address was written by the na-
tive deacon himself, and delivered on
the occasion of Dr. Anderson's visit
to the church in 1863. It will be
borne in mind that Dr. A. was the
Senior Secretary of the A. B. C. F. M.
Board which had sent all the Prot.
Missionaries to the Islands. Though
the time of the meeting was rainy, the
large church edifice was full of tidy,
intelligent, and deeply interested au-
ditors. The address was delivered in
the Hawaiian language, and translated
literally without any effort to preserve
the native idiom. It is as follows:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The church members of the high-
lands of WAIMEA, the old men, the
aged women, the strong men, the
youth and children, tender, through
me their salutation to you, the Secre-
tary, your companion, and daughter.
Great indeed is our joy in being per-
mitted to see you, to welcome you to
this land. You have been sent by the
learned Missionary Society of great
America, as its delegate to see the
works of the gospel heralds you have
sent us."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"We, the ancient men of Kame-
hameha's time, were once idolaters,
murderers, guilty of infanticide, polyg-
amy, and constantly quarrelling one
with another."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"On the death of Kamehameha, the
kingdom devolved on his son Liholi-
ho. He abolished idolatry broke the
tabus (superstitious rites); men and
women for the first time ate together,
and the temples and gods were burnt
to ashes."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Still we lived on in poverty and
darkness, and in secret worship of
idols, and were without the knowl-
edge of the living and true God. Men,
women and children were promis-
cuously devoted to the most sordid
pleasures, heathenish dances, and re-
velries, day and night. In the year
1820, the Missionaries, Mr. Bingham
and company, came to these Islands to
proclaim the blessed gospel to us, who
knew not God, nor had heard of the
death of Jesus, the Messiah, the Savi-
our of our world.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From you, the Missionary Society
you have sent, that loved us, and sent
the good Missionaries to our dark
land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The king and his premier allowed
the missionaries to dwell with us; to
introduce a new order of things; to
teach us first the twelve letters of the
alphabet; then spelling, then reading
and writing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"During the forty three years the
missionaries have resided on the Is-
lands, much seed has been sown, much
labor performed, and wonderful have
been the results. We were once all
dark, buried in darkness, sunk to the
lowest depths of ignorance; roaming
about the fields and woods, like wild
beasts; without clothing; our naked
bodies most shamefully exposed and
blackened by the sun; without books,
without Bibles, without Christianity;
plunging into the darkness of hell.
Now, we are clothed, like civilized
beings; we as Christianized; we are
gathered into churches; we are intel-
ligent; we are supplied with Bibles,
and hymn books; and are living for
God and for heaven! And this through
the labors of the missionaries you have
sent us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Our joy is inexpressible in seeing
you; and we beg you to carry back
to your associates, to the Missionary
Society, to all the American Churches
conneted with it, the warmest saluta-
tions of the Churches of Waimea and
Hanaukua."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There were two Hymns composed
by natives for the occasion, and sung
with great effect by a large choir of
the church members. One of them
by Lianna, Dr. A. took home with him
and submitted for the inspection of
Mr. Bingham and old returned mis-
sionary. He regarded it as a gem in
Hawaiian literature, and made a metri-
cal version of it. We give both the
original and the English.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}"After having addressed a score of
congregations," says Dr.A. "and more
than 12,000 of the people I cannot be
greatly mistaken in a general estimate
of their intelligence. • • • The con-
gregations at the stations varied from
five hundred to twelve hundred. The
meeting houses were generally filled
with people well clad, considering
their circumstances. One of my first
surprises at the Islands was to find
the people so generally and so well
dressed. Thirty years before, the
masses of the people scarcely felt the
need of clothes. The climate did not
require them, and the natives at first
looked upon our dress as merely or-
namental. It will illustrate this if I
relate an anecdote, which I received
from the best source. In one of the
first years of the mission a chief on
Hawaii was reproved by a missionary
for entering his house so nearly naked.
Profiting by the rebuke, and aiming
to give full satisfaction, next time he
walked in with the addition of a pair
of silk stockings and a hat. * * * *{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The natives have built more than
a hundred meeting-houses or churches
with but little foreign aid. * * * *{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the building of the older, larger,
more expensive churches, the govern-
ment, as such, had no agency. The
aggregate cost of the churches ex-
ceeded $150,000. Some of the largest
of them are built of coral or blocks of
lava. * * *Most have bells and the
"sound of the church going bell"
among the hills and valleys of those
Islands, seemed to me as suggestive, as
delightful as among the hills and val-
leys of my native land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In reply to Manly Hopkins's His-
tory of the Sandwich Islands publish-
ed in London in 1862 and intended
to disparage the labors of the mission-
aries, Mr. Damon the well known
Seaman's chaplin at Honolulu and
editor of the Friend's newspaper
says.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Mr. Hopkins has never visited the
Islands, and we have lived among the
Hawaiian people more than twenty
years. We have visited every inhab-
ited island of the group except Nii-
hau; we have visited every mission-
ary station on the Islands, and some
of them repeatedly; we are personally
acquainted with every missionary and
his family; we have spent many sab-
baths at the out stations; we have
traveled with and among Hawaiians
on sea and land; we have slept in
their houses; we are personally ac-
quainted with hundreds and thousands
of them; we have worshiped in their
churches; we have sat with them
around the 'table of the Lord.' Now
this is the honest conclusion to which
we have come as the result of our
observation, that, in proportion to the
population of the Islands, there are,
upon an average, as many christians
(members of the Prot. churches in
good standing) as there are among the
people of America or Europe; we
will not except New England, Scot-
land, or England or any other parti-
cularly favored portion of those
countries."{{< /news/text >}}

The present King of Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
PRA CHAUM KLAU.
CHAPTER XV.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}When a school boy has completed
his speech, and made his bow, he
jumps from the stage with glee, and
sits in a corner to enjoy the speeches
of his fellows I promised certain
chapters to the community and as I
put my pen to the last, my heart goes
pit-a-pat for joy, that my task is
done. I shall now read the speeches
that are to come, and watch the coun-
tenances of the public as they frown
and smile at the expense of the poor
speech maker.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I began with the commerce of the
country and here I shall end. The
king has patronized commerce. The
result is, that Siam has greater facili-
ties to take a stand among other na-
tions of the earth, in commerce, than
in any other department. In com-
merce it has great advantages even for
European capilalists, and for the na-
tive community, its facilities are un-
surpassed. The facilities for prepar-
ing rice for exportation, which must
ever remain the first staple product in
Siam, are very great. The only mis-
fortune is that the natives are not
prepared to second and promote im-
provements as they are introduced.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The steam-rice-mills, with one ex-
ception, are owned and controlled by
foreigners, while the natives yet cleave
to their handmills. The Bangkok
Dock Company have a magnificent
dock, but the natives yet cleave to
their mud docks, or have not patriot-
ism sufficient to patronize their own,
but choose to patronize foreign ports
instead of encouraging home facilities,
and making their own thrive and
prosper. A man ought to be willing
to die for his country, not to say he
ought to patronize home always, if
home needs patronizing. Siam has
arrived at the period of its history
when it needs noble sons, to adopt
its interests as their own, to live for it,
to think for it, to spend their energies
and money to serve it. What! shall
foreigners give their lives to serve
Siam, and sacrifice their all for it, and
shall it not have noble sons to come
forward and think it their greatest
honor to live to serve their genera-
tion! God forbid.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The great thing now to be secured
is to make Siam self reliant,—to learn
to protect its own, and to encourage
others to patronize Siam when it pre-
sents superior incouragements, and
certainly it has great facilities in
commerce. Do you ask to build ship?
There is not better timber in all the
east, than Siam affords, nor cheaper.
Come and build ships and welcome,
and save the trouble of transporting
the timber. Docks are there certainly.
That of the Bangkok Dock Com-
pany has not a superior. Generous,
liberal, deserved patronage would make
it one of Siam’s greatest sources of
improvement. Young Siam must come
forth manfully and stand by this noble
enterprise to a man. I am glad, one
that Siam loves especially to honor,
because he comes near the king, is
personally interested in its success.
The very idea of a generous outlay
of money for the good of his country,
must enlarge his ideas, and prepare
him to devise liberal things. I am
sorry to say, as yet it seems easier to
spend thousands on some gala day, to
fill the fancy for the hour and then
become food for worms, than to in-
vest in some substantial patriotic en-
terprise.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The regulations for commerce, al-
ready take the type of European ports.
A harbor master was one of the king's
first liberal salaried officers, and this
officer being a very efficient man, a
man after John Bull's own heart, that
never gives up, persevering under al-
most unsurmountable barriers, he has
port regulations, after the manner of
European harbors, signed and sanction-
ed by government. Every ship that
comes into port has the printed regul-
ations, and all the native vessels are
required by law, to have their clear-
ance papers from the harbor Master,
and to receive their masters and crews
in harbor through him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The desideratum now is a Semi-
nary for teaching the people purpo-
sing to give themselves to maritime busi-
ness, to become skillful seamen and
ship masters. The greatest shipowner
in Siam received his wealth from an
indefatigable father. He needs some
worthy object to employ his wealth,
which shall do good to his fellow men,
serve his country and the God who
has permitted him to become the
possessor of great wealth. Why could
not this very man found a seminary
to promote the interests of commerce,
and with a design to make his nation
great and good, give much energy to
this one end. He might invest a few
thousands in a library for a seaman's
home, and see to it, that that home
was an honorable one. He could do
much to give character to shipmasters,
by patronizing the very best for his
own ships, securing and discharging
in the Siamese port, thus giving sanc-
tion to wholesome laws. His wealth
may not seem a great sum for his own
wants, but his all would be little, if he
should purpose to serve liberally the
whole nation; while the stimulus
that such an object would secure,
would make his wealth productive and
be an investment that would bring
certain blessings, to the bestower.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A narrow policy is always an inse-
cure policy. He that would be secure-
ly great and go on increasing in great-
ness, must sacrifice self and serve his
race. If ones country demands thought
and effort and exertion, let the coun-
try have it. If the country has al-
ready attained to a high position, then
the heart should go out to other na-
tions which have not attained to pre-
eminence. The higher position a man
has, the more he should strive to be a
noble, generous, liberal minded man.
Let the highest nobleman stand by
the best interests of the king, and sup-
port the best interests of the kingdom.
Let him prepare himself to see the
end from the beginning, and with no-
ble aims, generous impulses, and far
seeing policy, stride fearlessly on,
hoping all good, and trusting the fu-
ture to the honesty and integrity of
his purpose, and his noble, generous
acts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Young Siam ought to have many

the hour of need, and give her ad-
vantages and impulses which would
rend the fetters that now render the
nation powerless, and give them the
power that always dwells with those
who purpose to do right and seek for
truth in every purpose that moves
them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A niggardly, selfish, narrow policy
kills any country. Live and let live,
is the watchword for progress. Let
the European community who have
drunk in a liberal policy with their
mother's milk, give Siam a noble ex-
ample in the policy which governs
them; and not allow themselves to
be characterized by a narrow, selfish

Gambling. Chapter II.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The hui lottery of Bangkok, which
we described last week, though by it-
self alone a tremendous curse to both
people and government, by no means
monopolizes the evils of gambling in
this city. It is not responsible for
more than one quarter of the aggre-
gate of the poverty and ruin done by
legalized and systematized games of
chance. There are seven or eight other
kinds of gambling which draw into
their several vortices far more from
the lower classes of the people than
the hue lotteries. Their names in the
Siamese tongue are poh, cood, p'ui
ipong duut sukaa ye. The first three
have by far the most power to swell
the revenue, and consequently the
most power for evil upon the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first is played with a small square
brass box accurately fitted into ano-
ther which shuts over it like the cov-
er of a calip[?]t excepting that it covers
the whole extent of the box. The die
is put into this box and shaken about
a few times, and then exposed to pub-
lic view. The second is played with
cowries or ots, and the third with
small cards. All the various kinds of
gambling carried on in Bangkok and
its suburbs are included in the same
farm with the hui lottery. It is be-
lieved that the farmer, or company as
it is, pays into the royal treasury for
the monopoly annually about 500,000
Ticals—-$300,000. This company has
no control over the gambling in the
several provinces of Siam. Each of
these is understood to have a gambling
farmer of its own. We have no means
of forming any accurate estimate of
the revenue derived from them, but
would judge that the aggregate of
them would at least quadruple the
sum obtained by the metropolitic gam-
bling farm. If so then we have the
round sum of $1,200,000 of royal
revenue sucked like a vampire out of
the heart of the body politic, every
year, and nothing given in lieu for it,
but the most corroding excitement year
in and year out, and with it general
blasting and mildew of the hopes of
the people, and nineteen twentieths of
all the slavery the quarrelling, the
thieving and robbing, suicides and
murder in the land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The kinds of gambling of which
we are now speaking, so far as this
city and suburbs are concerned, are
farmed out by the chief farmer to
sub-farmers located in the different
sections of the city, for specified sums,
to be paid annually in equal instal-
ments monthly. These sub-farmers
frequently sell their privileges to oth-
er parties, but still holding themselves
responsible for the payment of their
individual farms. Every sub-farmer
will of course do all he can to make
money out of his farm. And to this
end he establishes gambling stalls in
all the most eligible situations within
the limits of his farm. Consequently
you can scarcely go in any direction
five minutes on land or on water with-
out coming to a gambling shed or a
gambling floating house. You cannot
send your servant to market any
where without placing him under
temptations to stop in some gambling
shop by his way to try his luck at the
games, and that too with the money
which you have put into his hand for
purchasing food for your table. We
cannot number the times that we have
had our souls vexed by the long tar-
rying of our cooks at the market or
somewhere between it and us on ac-
count of their getting involved in some
of those [?] of the devil, the gamb-
ling shops. Having lost all the mo-
ney we gave them, they are compelled
to seek some friend from whom they
can borrow enough to supply its place,
and with it to make the purchases we
ordered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Language cannot begin to describe
the confusion and misery this gam-
bling produces in families. The fol-
lowing is a fair illustration of one
phase of it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But a few days since our hired
man whom we have been in the
habit of sending early in the morning
for our milk, where it is milked from
the cows, was most promptly and
clearly brought out in such practices,
and that on rather of a large scale.
Thinking him one of our most trust-
worthy servants, being the husband
of one of our church members, we
sent by him every month for four
successive times the sum of 4⅛ Ticals
to pay a bill of milk for one family.
The owner of the milk having been
hood winked by our servant, waited
full four months before he came to us
to enquire about the non-payment of
the monthly bills, saying that the ser-
vant had reported to him that he had
lost some of them in the river by the
capsizing of his little skiff; at another
time by loaning the sum to a friend
of his; and so forth. Hearing this
report we summoned the man to us to
give an account of himself in the pre-
sence of our milk-creditor. He could
do no other but confess that he had
lost each of the four sums of 4⅛ Ti-
cals by gambling, that when the first
was lost he tried the game with the
second, hoping to get it back again at
least doubled, and when that slipped
into the hands of the master gambler,
he was tempted to try his fortune
again with the third 4⅛, and thus
with the fourth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not many months since we sent by
our post boy a receipted Bill for
printing to an American merchant of
the city amounting to about twelve
Ticals. He sent the pay by the hand
of the post-boy, accompanied by a
letter certifying that he did so. The
post thought he must manage in some-
way to have the letter reach its
destination as it might be on other
very important business, and hence
sent the letter by the hand of another
person, and ran away from our ser-
vice. But his wife was living on our
premises and hence he could not run
far away from her. We heard of him
skulking around town, not daring to
show himself in daylight on our place.
We felt a compassion for him, parti-
cularly so, as he was a church mem-
ber and otherwise one of the most
faithful and efficient of our servants.
We sent word to him that we would
treat him kindly provided he would
confess his fault, solemnly promise re-
pentance, and pay damages to the
amount of one month's pay. He glad-
ly returned, and has been since remak-
ably faithful and useful to us in his
calling.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A wife of one our most frugal, in-
dustrious, and faithful servants be-
came bewitched with the prigambling
near her house. No importunity, nor
authority, nor punishment from her
husband could stop her from spend-
ing nearly all her time in that porch
of hell, generally losing, but winning
just often enough to keep up the hope
of coming out affluent at last. Thus
she waxed more and more desperate,
utterly neglecting her little children
pawning every thing almost on which
she could lay hands in her house; and
when her own goods and her husbands
failed, borrowing of her neighbors;
and thus involving him in debts
which must be paid even though the
wife and children and husband, have
all to be pawned as slaves in lieu of
them. The husband felt that he must
divorce her for this reason, and did
so. She took the babe for her share
of the children, and he the three older
children. She went to her family
connections among the Peguans and
married another man, and he took ano-
ther wife and thus they are still living.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now such cases are occurring con-
tinually among our own servants, and
they may doubtless be counted by
thousands weekly in this city. One
case similar in a wife on the very
verge of committing suicide, was under
God rescued by one of the missionary
ladies, by kind words and a judicious-
ly helping hand. She now seems to
have been entirely broken of the love
of gambling, and makes again a faith-
ful wife and provident mother.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are two seasons of three
holidays each every year when all the
people are allowed to gamble when and
where they please. These are at the
times of the Siamese New-year and
Songkran and the people plunge into
with the greatest zest. This freedom
seems to operate as a bait to all classes,
giving them an irresistable desire to
gamble at other times. Hence it
comes to be accounted by government
as a license that works together for
the increase of the royal revenue from
the gambling farms. Oh that the
government could see that it works
rottenness in the very roots and heart
of the kingdom!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At all other times, outside of those
two holiday seasons, the people are
required by the great power delegated
to the chief farmer to gamble in the
places appointed, that he may be en-
abled to pay promptly the monthly
instalments on the pledges he has
given to government.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}We have heard of no local news of
any special interest since our last issue.
As usual nearly all the avenues to the
affairs of the Europeans in the city
and country are shut up, or at least
significantly silent. It is well known
that our columns are continually open
for reports from the many consular
courts located here, and would gladly
publish them: but not one of them has
a word to say of its affairs. Can it
be possible that there is nothing ever
doing at any of the nine consulates
that would be interesting to the pub-
lic to see in print? Is it possible that
this is an evidence of their loving
darkness rather than light? We are
not willing, as yet, to adopt this sen-
timent; and are inclined to think their
silence attributable more to negli-
gence of what would interest and pro-
fit the public in their affairs than to
any other cause. But we beg to en-
quire, is such reticence usual at con-
sulates in any other Asiatic city, and
if not why should it be requisite in
this great metropolis? As the trans-
actions at the several Consulates are
taken for granted to be just and no-
ble, far above that of any court of
equity among the heathen about them,
they would doubtless exert a happy
influence upon the heathen courts if
published in the local papers both
Siamese and English, because the power
of example is far greater than that of
precept. And if published they
would prevent many false reports
circulated concerning the Consular
courts, which work practical injury
to both the heathen and christian
public. It seems to us, hence a duty
as mere philanthropists which the
several consuls owe to themselves, this
heathen government and people to
make public here the most important
transactions at their several courts.
We greatly desire to have this heathen
people and government receive fre-
quently such practical lessons in ju-
risprudence as the several European
and American Consuls in this city are
able to give them, and we would see
that they are faithfully translated into
the Siamese language and duly pub-
lished.{{< /news/text >}}

favored with regular reports from the
Commissioner of the Police. But
this volume has been able to procure

six months? That cannot be the fact.
Why then has he thus retired from
public view?{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The season of Siamese holidays have
nearly past. There was a vast boat
procession on the 24th inst. for escort-
ing a little relic of Buddh to a distant
temple. It passed through the Bang-
kok-yai canal, going inland. We
judge that there were at least five
thousand people engaged in it, all
seated in small open sampans and
skiffs. It was half a mile long, and
the boats passed from two to four
side by side, thickly studding the
canal. We observed that a very large
majority of the people were women
and girls, all arrayed in their very
best costume, and most of them wear-
ing gentlemen's hats of bamboo, grass,
and felt. The few men and boys
seemed to have it for their part in the
concern to make a great noise with
drums, gongs, horns, and shouting.
Some of them were dressed in the
most comical and ridiculous style, hats
topsy-turvy, coats and panungs of the
roughest and raggedest material, faces
painted black, red and white, with old
pots and kettles and other things in-
numerable and indescribable in their
sampans to attract attention.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The sacred relic was placed on a
high gilded throne in a Chinese jolly
boat, under a party-colored canopy,
with a band of Chinese gong-beaters
and horn players to make a jargon.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have seen nothing more heath-
enish for years. It would strike an
unaccustomed European that all that
ado was a mere farce, with the view
to ridicule Buddhism. But no—It
was to honor idolatry and make merit
for the eternal future. What a de-
lusion!{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}During a short visit to the seashore
of our State, some two years since,
with a party of friends, it was pro-
posed, one bright afternoon, that we
should go down the harbor on a fish-
ing excursion. We accordingly start-
ed, and after sailing about three miles,
a young lady of the company declined
going further, and requested us to
land her on one of the small islands in
the harbor, where she proposed to stay
until our return. My little boy, then
about four years old, preferred remain-
ing with her. Accordingly we left
them and proceeded some six miles
further. We remained out much
longer than we intended, and as night
approached, a thick fog set in from
the sea, entirely enshrouding us.
Without compass, and not knowing
the right direction to steer, we groped
our way along for some hours, until
we discovered the breaking surf on
one of the islands, but were at a loss
to know which one of them. I stood
up in the stern of the boat, where I
had been steering, and shouted with
all my strength. I listened a moment
and heard, through the thick fog, and
above the breaking of the surf, the
sweet voice of my boy, calling, "Come
this way, father-—steer straight for
me; I'm waiting for you!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We steered by that sound, and soon
my little boy leaped into my arms
with joy, saying: "I knew you would
hear me, father!" and nestled to sleep
on my bosom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The child and the maiden are both
sleeping now. They died in two short
weeks after the period I refer to, with
hardly any interval of time between
their deaths.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now, when tossed upon the rough
sea of life, without compass or guide,
enveloped in fog and surrounded by
rocks, I seem to hear the sound of
that cherub voice calling from the
bright shore, "Come this way, father!
steer straight for me!" When op-
pressed with sadness, I take my way
to our quiet cemetery, and still, as I
stand on one little mound, the same
musical voice echoes from thence,
"Come this way, father,-—I'm waiting
for you!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent2 >}}I remember a voice

{{< news/indent3 >}}Which once guided my way.

{{< news/indent2 >}}When, lost on the sea,

{{< news/indent3 >}}Fog enshrouded I lay.

{{< news/indent2 >}}'Twas the voice of a child,

{{< news/indent3 >}}As he stood on the shore—-

{{< news/indent2 >}}It sounded out clear

{{< news/indent3 >}}O'er the dark billows' roar;

{{< news/indent2 >}}"Come this way, my father!

{{< news/indent3 >}}Steer straight for me,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Here safe on the shore

{{< news/indent3 >}}I am waiting for thee!"

{{< news/indent2 >}}I remember the voice,

{{< news/indent3 >}}As it led our lone way,

{{< news/indent2 >}}"Midst rocks and through breakers,

{{< news/indent3 >}}And high-dashing spray;

{{< news/indent2 >}}How sweet to my heart

{{< news/indent3 >}}Did it sound from the shore,

{{< news/indent2 >}}As it echoed out clear

{{< news/indent3 >}}O'er the dark billows' roar,—-

{{< news/indent2 >}}"Come this way, my father!

{{< news/indent3 >}}Steer straight for me;

{{< news/indent2 >}}Here safe on the shore

{{< news/indent3 >}}I am waiting for thee."

{{< news/indent2 >}}I remember my joy

{{< news/indent3 >}}When I held to my breast

{{< news/indent2 >}}The form of that dear one,

{{< news/indent3 >}}And soothed it to rest;

{{< news/indent2 >}}For the tones of my child

{{< news/indent2 >}}"I called you, dear father,

{{< news/indent3 >}}I knew you would hear

{{< news/indent3 >}}Far o'er on the sea,

{{< news/indent2 >}}While, safe on the shore,

{{< news/indent3 >}}I was waiting for thee."

{{< news/indent2 >}}That voice is now hushed

{{< news/indent3 >}}Which then guided my way,

{{< news/indent2 >}}The form I then pressed

{{< news/indent3 >}}Is now mingled with clay;

{{< news/indent2 >}}But the tones of my child

{{< news/indent3 >}}Still sound in my ear,—-

{{< news/text >}}As the U. S. sloop of war “Shenandoah”
expected here very shortly, the follow-
ing particulars respecting her will be read
with interest. The extract is from the
Bombay TIMES of India :—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The United States sloop of war SHEN-
NDOAH, Capt. Goldsborough, arrived in
Bombay harbour on September 28th, her
at port of call having been Muscat, which
acc abe left on the 18th inst. Her command.
reports on the day before leaving Mus-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}cat, the uncle of the present Imaum landed
and took possession of the fort, and after-
wards opened fire upon the town The I-
maum appealed to Capt. Goldsborough for
assistance, but was informed that the lat-
ter had no power to interfere. When the
steamer started for Bombay the trouble was
not settled. Upon anchoring in the har-
bor a salute of twenty one guns was fired
from the saluting battery, which was re-
turned by the SHENANDOAH, followed by
a salute of five guns to Mr. Ketridge, the
United StatesConsul.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The SHENANDOAH is a namesake of the
vessel which occupied such a prominent
position during the American struggle, and
was built in Philadelphia in 1863. She
is a wooden vessel, but is iron plated amid-
ships as a protection for her engines. Her
crew consists of 29 officers and 200 men,
and she carries nine guns, including two
90-pounder pivot riffled guns. During the
American war she formed one of the block-
ading squadron, and was only once engag-
ed in active warfare, when in an attack
upon Fort Fisher, North Carolina, she was
severely injured.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The SHENANDOAH left the States in De-
cember last, and has visited Fayal, Malei-
ra, Rio Janeiro, Cape Town, Mauritius, Ma-
dagascar, and Muscat.—-TRANSCRIPT.{{< /news/text >}}

General Grant.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}General Grant has authorized a writer,
whose letter appears in another part of
this sheet, to make a statement of his views
on public affairs. It is to the following
effect: That, next to the President, he is
the head of the army of the United States:
not the leader of a political party; that he
does not consider the army a place for a
politician; that he will not permit himself
to be committed to any party, and that
the army shall not be made a political ma-
chine.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These expressions furnish a new and stri-
king illustration of that profound common
sense which is at once the greatest charm
of General Grant and his strongest hold
upon the affection and confidence of the
people. Whether he fights or speaks, he
strikes hard, and there is no excuse for or
misunderstanding. It is evident that the
General does not intend to be made the in-
strument of any party, nor will he be di-
verted from the strict performance of his
official duties by cajolery or threats.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Emperor when at Hain, very much
studied the question of armaments, he now
has serious thoughts of passing from the
ory to practice.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The problem to be solved is the follow-
ing:—to be able to place 1,200,000 on a
war footing at a very short notice,—the
Prussian military system,—seems of all
others that which offers the most advanta-
ges, there is one drawback and that is, that
it arms universal suffrage and indisposes
it.{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I think however, the general opinion is
for the adoption of the American volunteer
system, as the system of armed peace is a
most ruinous one for all European nations,
and in case of a war between Prussia and
France, there is no doubt but the French
system would be found wanting. Bismark
is well aware of this, and hence his arro-
gant and overbearing conduct toward us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This ambitious statesman now wants
nothing less than Dutch Limburg, he kind-
ly and generously proposes that France
should annex Belgium.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The sudden resignation of Monsieur
Drouyn de L'huys which took us by surprise,
is now no longer a subject of wonder, it
turns out that when the minister of Foreign
affairs was writing threatening letters to
Bismarck, summoning him to give France
some territorial compensation for the an-
nexation of Prussia, Napoleon III was se-
cretly writing polite and conciliatory letters
to the King of Prussia, telling him that he
wanted nothing, and was well pleased with
what had taken place in Germany.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Monsieur Drouyn de L'huye cut to the
quick by the conduct of the Emperor, threw
up his portfolio, it is a well known hitch
of Napoleon III to give his ministers but
the semblance of power.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Monsieur Lavalette, is substitute for
Monsieur de Moustier until he shall arrive
here from Constantinople, when he gets to
Paris he will find the line of policy he
will have to pursue, cut and direct the Im-
perial system of government which may
be very well when the sovereign is young,
vigorous and liberal; but a deplorable one
when he is old and ailing. Monsieur Rou-
her, who may be called Prime minister, is
all powerful and does with the Emperor
what he likes.—-PENANG ARGUS.{{< /news/text >}}

Odds and Ends.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}What great city is like an habitual
drunkard? Berlin, because it is always
on a spree. (Berlin is on the river Spree.){{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why is an author a queer animal?
Because his tale comes out of his head.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—Shall the great Housekeeper of
the world water his flowers, prune his
plants, fodder his cattle, and not feed
his children! Never think it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—Quietness before God is one of the
most difficult of all Christian graces—
to sit where he places us, to be what
he would have us to be; and this as
long as he pleases.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—The late Bishop Chase, of Illinois,
had a dislike to having Greek Roman
names imposed upon children, which he
displayed very pointedly on one occa-
sion when a child was brought to him
to be baptized. "Name this child," said
the Bishop. "Marcus Tullius Cicero,"
answered the father. "What!" "Mar-
cus Tullius Cicero." "Tut, tut! with
your heathen nonsense! Peter, I bap-
tize thee," &c., and the child was Pe-
ter thenceforth and forever.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—At a meeting of church officers,
on one occasion, a certain person not
remarkable for purity of life, sent in a
request for admission into their fold.
One of the committee—-a rather rough
man—-on hearing the name of the in-
dividual, exclaimed: "That man!
Well, if that man is to be admitted to
the church, he ought to soak over
night!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-The ending syllable "ough,"
which is such a terror to foreigners,
is shown up in its several pronuncia-
tions in the following lines:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}Wife, make me some dumplings of dough,

{{< news/indent2 >}}They are better than meal for my cough;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Pray let them be'boiled till hot through,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Now I must be off to my plough,

{{< news/indent2 >}}And the boys (when they've had enough,)

{{< news/indent1 >}}Must keep the flies off with a bough,

{{< news/indent2 >}}While the ole mare drinks at the trough.

{{< news/text >}}Why is Athens like a worn-out shoe?
