Gladstone and Disraeli.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}All who hear Mr. Gladstone must
perceive that there is a mixture of ani-
mosity and contempt in his treatment
of Mr. Disraeli which he never betrays
when replying to any other speaker.
He then becomes most animated, puts
forth all his strength and oratorical
science, and seems not only bent on
defeating an opponent, but on crush-
ing an enemy. In the shock of these
two antagonists we see the last re-
mains of the bitter political feeling of
the last generation, which has been
dying out since the repeal of the Corn
Laws in 1846, and the key to these
feelings must be sought in the history
of those times. Mr. Gladstone was the
chosen friend and disciple of Sir Ro-
bert Peel; Mr. Disraeli his bitter and
unscrupulous enemy. Had it not been
for Mr. Disraeli, the repeal of the Corn
Laws would probably have been ac-
quiesced in by the country gentlemen,
the Conservatives would never have
split, and the Protectionist party
would never have existed. It was Mr.
Disraeli who urged the Tory rank and
file to turn out their natural leaders,
and take himself in their place; who
shortened the life of Peel by his veno-
mous accusations, and caused Glad-
stone, Sidney Herbert, Newcastle,
Cardwell, and others, to wander as
outcasts, under the name of Peplites,
till Lord Aberdeen’s Government in
1853. The first time that Mr. Disraeli
gained the climax of his ambition in
high office was in 1852, as Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and then it was that
Mr. Gladstone met him in fair fight,
and overthrew him in the sight of
friends and foes. His budget was
mercilessly dissected—he had to beat
an ignominious retreat—and Mr.
Gladstone succeeded to his office, to
reap his greenest laurels where his op-
ponent had exhibited his greatest fail-
ure. All who heard the speech of
1852 must have thought of it while
Mr. Gladstone was speaking the other
night. It was not the mere Franchise
Bill that roused his energies. The
memories of a life were present to him,
and he was answering the man who
had driven him from the track of poli-
tical life he meant to pursue, and led
him to find friends he never dreamed
of. Mr. Disraeli was now occupying
the post as Conservative leader of the
House of Commons, which Mr. Glad-
stone had probably looked forward to
in moments of early ambition. By
clever jockeying he obtained the post
of leader fifteen years earlier than his
rival; and this was the man who ven-
tured to taunt him with his youthful
aspirations, which he himself had been
the principal agent in frustrating.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If the Ministry are beaten, and dis-
solve on the cry of reform or no reform,
the Tories will assuredly be beaten,
but a fierce spirit will be aroused, and
the lovers of wild popular energies
will clap their hands. The Tories will
not be able to direct the course of af-
fair as they do now, but will depend
for moderation on the mercies of their
opponents. Mr. Disraeli has raised
once more the old standard of Toryism,
which we thought had been laid up
for ever in some old baronial hall, or
buried in the grave of Lord Eldon. It
means that change as change is bad,
that reform of our institutions is un-
necessary, and that these have a self-
adapting power, if left to themselves,
to conform to the wants of ever advan-
cing time. This doctrine is held in
spite of the fact that change is the
great rule of nature; in spite of the
teachings of history confirming the
wise aphorism of Bacon, “morosa re-
rum retentio res turbulentas est, neque
ac novitas.” We thought it was the
Conservatives—-that is, the advocates
of moderate progress-—who were op-
posed to the Liberals in the House of
Commons, till Mr. Disraeli raised the
old battle-cry. We now know that
we have to deal with the old spirit
which opposed the abolition of the
punishment of death for stealing five
shillings from the pocket, with the
same violent antagonism as if it had
been an act to abolish monarchy. We
cannot believe that many will follow
such a cry, but we grieve to see among
the number General Peel, with head-
long excitement, offering himself as a
leader. General Peel, in whose sound
judgment and common sense his
brother, the great Sir Robert, placed
such confidence, that he is said to have
been the only man with whom he talk-
ed over some of his most important
measures. General Peel now places
himself side by side with his brother’s
enemy, in opposition to all reform, for
his speeches will bear no other sense;
thus turning his back on his own
opinions and acts seven years ago.
We discredit the rumours current,
that it is necessary for the “Tory”
party to “blood their hounds;” that
office has irresistible charms, if it be
only for three months, in order that a
few bishops and magistrates may be
made, and a few pensions and places
granted. Such sordid views can never
actuate a great party: but if the Tor-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ies act now as they blamed the Whigs
for acting in 1859 about their own
Reform Bill, they stand self-condem-
ned; but if they assist in settling a
troublesome obstacle in the way of
peaceable progress, their magnanimity
will be appreciated, and the, country
will not forget it. Mr. Gladstone sup-
ported them in 1859, and it was not
his fault that reform was not then car-
ried. Let them support him now in
return. If they do not, the words of
Carlyle, once applied to the great
Peel, will be true of Gladstone:—"The
largest verascity ever done in Parlia-
ment in our time, as we all know, was
of this man's doing; and I believe
England, in her dumb way, remembers
that too. The 'traitor Peel' can very
well afford to let innumerable ducal
costermongers, parliamentary adventur-
ers, and lineal representatives of the
Impenitent Thief, say all their say
about him, and do all their do. With
a virtual England at his back, and an
actual eternal sky above him, there is
not much in the total net amount of
that. When the master of the horse
rides abroad, many dogs in the village
bark; but he pursues his journey all
the same."—Fortnightly Review.{{< /news/text >}}

Wealth Well Used.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The last number of the Foreign Mis-
SIONARY contains among its acknowledge-
ments the gift of a New York gentle-
man, of $5,000. One might be tempted
to inquire whether, in view of the ex-
treme destitution of the city poor, that
sum might not be better devoted to their
necessities. On inquiry, however, it will
be found that this $5,000 is hardly a tithe
of what this same man dispenses in char-
ities, most of which are at home. Surely,
then, he may be permitted to send a lit-
tle abroad. This same man may be oc-
casionally seen in the Fifth avenue as he
gets into his carriage of an afternoon,
after a heavy day's work. He is rather
under medium size, of plain attire, with
locks somewhat blanched, and a sensible,
every-day countenance, such as you
might expect in a good business man.
He carries a heavy burden on his should-
ers, nothing less than that of an estate of
several millions, which he inherited from
his father, who was one of the merchant
princes of New York at the beginning of
the present century. All this he has ad-
ministered with the utmost care, for the
sole purpose of doing good. He avoids
the world, and dwells apart in his own
little circle; he allows no applicants to
see him, but seeks out worthy objects, or
listens to the appeals of well-known
channels of charity. Every day he at-
tends closely to business, with the aid of
his collector and agent, and then finds a
quiet amusement in his private library,
which is one of the finest in the world, or
in his picture gallery which is unequal-
led in America. All his income, after
paying his current expenses, is devoted
to doing good, and his influence is felt
in the cause of benevolence throughout
the world. This accounts for that $5,000.
Such are the leading points in the char-
acter of that humble Christian, known as
James Lenox.—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

Queen Victoria and the
Fenians.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A London correspondent of the "New
York Tribune" writes:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}An interesting anecdote of the Queen's
humanity and attachment to her army
has just come to my knowledge. You
may have noticed in the news from Ire-
land the trial of a Sergeant Derrangh for
Fenianism, of which he was found guilty
and sentenced to be shot. When the war-
rant was brought to the Queen for signa-
ture, her consent was urgently solicited
on the grounds of the necessity of mak-
ing an example, and at length obtained,
though she burst into tears in the act of
recording it. Within an hour afterward
she sent for the warrant again and torn
it to pieces—and God bless her for it!
The act will effect more toward extirpa-
ting Fenianism in the ranks—if it exist
there—than all the constables, spies,
lawyers, judges and hangmen within the
fair seas of Brittian could do.{{< /news/text >}}

How Pennsylvania Coal was
Discovered.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A writer in the “New York Observer”
asserts that Col. George Shoemaker, a
gentleman of Teutonic origin, was the
discoverer of Pennsylvania coal. He
lived on the Schuylkill, and owned ex-
tensive tracts. The writer goes on to say.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“It chanced one day that in construc-
ting a lime kiln he used some of the black
stones that were lying about the place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}‘Mine Got! mine Got! der ethones po
all on fire!’ exclaimed the astonished
Dutchman, when the rich glow of the
ignited anthracite met his gaze. The
neighbors, who, of course, were few and
far between, were, after much ado, as-
sembled to witness the marvel. This hap-
pened in 1812. Shortly after, mine host
loaded a Pennsylvania team with the
black stones and journeyed to Philadel-
phia, a distance of 93 miles. There un-
foreseen difficulties were presented. The
grates and stoves then in use were not
constructed to facilitate the combustion
of anthracite, and burn it would not !
After many ineffectual efforts to ignite
the product, it was thrown aside as worth-
less, and our discomfited German, who
had beguiled his toilsome way to the
metropolis with dreams of ingots, return-
ed to digest his disappointment in his
uncertain solitude." — Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A Match Factory.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A match factory in Western New York
is noted for the curious machinery used
in the manufacture. 720,000 feet of pine
of the best quality are used annually for
the matches, and 400,000 feet of bass-
wood for cases. The sulphur used an-
nually for the matches is 400 barrels, and
the phosphorus is 9,600 pounds. The
machines run night and day, and 300
hands are employed at the works. 600
pounds of paper per day are used to
make the light small boxes for holding
the matches, and four tons of paste-
board per week for the larger boxes.
Sixty-six pounds of flour per day are
used for paste, and the penny stamps re-
quired by government on the boxes a-
mount to the snug little sum of $1,440
per day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are four machines in use for
cutting, dipping and delivering the mat-
ches. The two-inch pine plank is sawed
up the length of the match, which is 2½
inches. These go into the machine for
cutting, where at every stroke 12 mat-
ches are cut, and by the succeeding stroke
pushed into slats arranged on a double
chain 250 feet long, which carries them
to the sulphur vat, and from thence to
the phosphorous vat and thus across the
room and back, returning them at a point
just in front of the cutting machine, and
where they are delivered in their natural
order, and are gathered up by a boy into
trays and sent to the packing room. Thus
1,000 gross or 144,000 small boxes of
matches are made per day. The ma-
chines for making the small, thin paper
boxes and their covers are quite as in-
geniously contrived as those that make
the matches. A long coil of paper, as
wide as the box is long, revolves on a
wheel, one end being in the machine. It
first passes through rollers, where the
printing is done, from thence to the
pasteboxes, where the sides and ends on-
ly are pasted; from thence to the folding
apparatus, where the ends are nicely
folded and the whole box is pasted to-
gether and drops into a basket. A sim-
ilar machine is at work at the covers, and
thus 144,000 boxes per day are manufac-
tured."-—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

The Roots of Slavery.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are many roots of slavery left
in the ground, though the main trunk has
been cut down, and these roots must not
be allowed to shoot forth new sprouts.
The roots themselves must be torn to
work of the greatest difficulty with us,
because slavery attached itself in our
country to a race. It extended, and still
extends, in many portions of the country;
the degradation inherent in slavery to
the color of the formerly enslaved people.
A free negro stood always nearer to the
slave, legally and socially, than to the
freeman of the dominant people. As to 
state sovereignty it is a provincial egotism,
which all history shows is pleasing to
most men of minor aspirations. The
American problem is, to unite the highest
degree of self-government, not only of
the states, but of a thousand institutions,
with the fullest nationality and the plain-
est and warmest patriotism—undivided
devotion to the whole country. The
national policy is the normal type of
modern government.—-Dr. Lieber.{{< /news/text >}}

The Hearty Christian.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A hearty Christian is one who can work
as well as eat. If there is a heavy load
to carry in Christ's cause, he takes to it
at once. If there is a wall to build, he
is the man to lift the big stones. If some
one has to go out into the storm and
endure pelting opposition, who so able
to bear it as his broad breast and brawny
arms? A man that loves Christ loves
work. A dyspeptic christian dreads
work. A lazy Christian shirks it. What
a hospital is many a church! Here lies
one poor man down with a paralysis of
faith. Here is another laid up by a
sprain which he got by a sudden fall into
temptation. Here is one whom the fever
of passion has turned out; he looks hardly
worth the medicine to cure him. And
for another he is under pastoral treat-
ment for the blindness of unbelief! and
for another, whose gaping wound reveals
the spot where Satan's fiery dart went in!
A revival commonly clears the church
hospital. But a long period of spiritual
declension cramps it to the doorway. O,
what need that he who went through
Galilee healing all manner of diseases,
should come into some of our hearts.—

The Mistake-—What
Keeps you Back.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Brother Nettleton," said a New Eng-
land pastor, whom that once eminent revi-
valist was visiting," "I wish you would
talk to some of our young converts a
little."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"What is the special difficulty?" asked
Mr. N.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"They are tardy in making a profes-
sion of their faith," was the reply.
"There is young Hobart, who trusts that
he experienced a saving change nearly a
year ago; yet he shrinks from confessing
Christ before men. He is come in this
evening for a little practice in singing;
I wish you would speak with him."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Give me an opportunity to see him
alone, then," said Mr. Nettleton. The
pastor did so.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Introducing the subject with his usual
tact, he soon drew from the young man
his reasons for declining to take upon
himself the vows of Christian discipleship.
"It seems, sir, like challenging the world
to look at me, a miserable sinner that I am,
as a representative of Christ-—like setting
myself up as something specially good—-
proclaiming my own righteousness in
short. I can not bear the thought of
even seeming to say to others: 'Stand by;
I am holier than ye,' when I realize so
painfully how imperfect I am."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I understand you, friend Hobart, and
believe you are sincere in this expression
of humility. But it seems to me that you
have made a mistake with regard to this
matter. It is not yourself, but Christ,
that you are asked to profess. Surely
you believe Him to be the 'chiefest a-
mong ten thousand,' the altogether lovely
—-a great God and a Saviour'?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Yes, sir, he is that to me; I love him,
and feel that I can never love him too
much."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Well—that is what you are to confess
to the world!-—that Jesus is infinitely good
and precious, while you are vile and sin-
ful—and has laid you under everlasting
obligations to love and serve Him, and
that, with the help of His promised
grace, you will try to fulfill those obliga-
tions. You are willing, I trust, that your
fellow-men should know this?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Yes, sir, I am; and if I had looked
at the subject in that light, I should not
have hesitated so long. But I was so
afraid of 'setting up for a saint,' as the
world says. I see now that it is Christ,
and not myself, I am to hold up; and
that to make a profession of religion is to
tell what a glorious Saviour He is, to
pardon and make a child of a sinner like
me. I do love Him, trust Him and mean
to serve him; and the world shall know it."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Are any of our readers making the
same mistake which Mr. Nettleton so
happily corrected in the above sketch?{{< /news/text >}}

Beginning the Day with God.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are many toiling ones whose time
is not at their own command, but there is
no one who cannot hold converse with God.
His ear can hear amid the clang and roar
of machinery, or the hum of hundreds of
voices. The heart can go up to him no
matter what the surroundings. Wherever
Abraham pitched his tent, there he raised
up an altar to the Lord. So, wherever the
Christian heart is, there is also an accepta-
ble altar from which the incense of prayer
and praise may ascend.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Yet there are few who may not, if they
will, find time and place for private com-
munion with God before entering on the
morning's duties.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gen. Havelock would rise at four, if the
hour for marching was at six, rather than
lose the precious privilege of communion
with his God, before setting out.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Luther, in his busiest seasons, felt that
praying time was never lost. When re-
markably pressed with labors he would
say, “I have so much to do that I cannot
get on without three hours a day praying.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir Matthew Hale also bears this testi-
mony: “If I omit praying and reading
God's word in the morning, nothing goes
well all day.” How many of us may find
here the cause of many of our failures, and
consequent discontent and unhappiness.{{< /news/text >}}

Why Rice is so dear
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Foreign business in this city is now
extremely dull. The prices of Rice,
the leading staple of the country still
remain wonderfully high considering
the great amount of the grain there
must be in the country, and the fine
prospects of a bountiful crop within
three months of the harvest. What
the grand cause of this state of the
rice market may be is a question hard
to solve. A large share of the influ-
ences which conspire to this result,
probably, take their rise in the fact
that both the native growers of the
grain and native ship owners who ex-
port it are yet young and compara-
tively inexperienced in the business
of commerce, and do not as readily
conform to a state when prices of the
great staple should be cheap as more
age and experience would lead them
to do. The former are like children
who have so long been fed with sweet
meats, and have had their digestive
functions thereby so depraved that
you cannot reconcile them to any
other than a sweet meat diet. The
rice growers have been so long indul-
ged with exorbitant prices for their
grain, that they are determined to
keep up the prices of it at the great
risk of coming out penny wise and
pound foolish. They are disgusted
with the idea of over selling rice again
as cheaply as they sold it 3 years ago,
however well they could afford to do
so. The same unbending adherence to
high prices for labor is seen among all
other classes of the natives. For exam-
ple our coolies, who had their wages
raised in the time of the great scarcity
and dearness of rice, will not now con-
sent to work for lower wages when
food is more plenty and cheap. It is
exceedingly difficult if not impossible
to incline them to conform to such a
change.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The native ship owners, having not
much short of a hundred square rigged
merchant vessels at command, and
being in circumstances in which they
can better afford to give high prices
for rice than foreigners can, and being
unwilling to have their tonnage lie
idle, are ever ready to indulge the rice
owners in their high demands. This
seems to us a plausible reason why
Europeans and Americans cannot pro-
cure the grain at lower figures. If the
natives had much fewer vessels, not
nearly enough to export all the mer-
chandise annually offered for exporta-
tion, foreigners could have some pow-
er to bring down the prices of rice.
But as the rice growers are now but
little dependent on the vessels of forei-
gners, the latter can hence have but
little control of the rice market. We
see not how they can do much in any
way to bring about a change in their
favor unless they can effect it through
the Steam Mills, which we learn are
now hulling nearly all the rice that is
exported. If they can keep that pow-
er and increase it they may do much
in controlling the prices of Rice. But
this power is liable to pass out of their
hands as that of the Bangkok Ship-
ping has done. Native speculators are
preparing themselves to take the pow-
er when it begins to shift hands, and
when they do so foreign speculators in
rice will have to retire or learn to do
their business with as little profit as
the natives do.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is, we may say, unfortunate for
foreign business men that they have
furnished the natives with so many
merchant vessels, some 30 or 40 with-
in a few years, putting into their hands
so much power to control the export-
ation of the great staple of the coun-
try. But who shall say that it is not
in the same proportion fortunate for
the growers of rice and for the people
of the country generally, that the na-
tive business men have thus adroitly
managed to get the control of Siam-
ese commerce into their own hands!
We are not of that class who think
white rice at ¼ of a tical (32 cents)
per basket, from month to month and
year to year, will operate as a calami-
ty to the people, no not even to the
poorer classes. We are of the opinion
that such a state of the market is
working great good to these classes,
making it necessary for them to be far
more provident and industrious than
formerly. Rice at only half that price,
as it used to be, did but foster idleness
and improvidence, and was hence in
its influence, in one sense, as much
a curse as a blessing. The high
prices of rice causes other articles of
food of almost all kinds to rise to a
proportionate high figure. And all
this we think is working real good.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some think that a great cause of
the present high prices of rice is that
there has been so much money brought
into the country by trade and so little
sent out, that the rice dealers have
buried their money in the earth and
hence feel emboldened to risk much
in holding back their rice for high
prices. We confess to little faith in
this explanation. Our long experience
with both Siamese and Chinese
lead us to think it quite unlike them
to hoard up money in that way. Those
who have made money these late years
have expended nearly all of it upon
their own persons, equipage, houses
boats, ships, and Buddhist temples.{{< /news/text >}}

Petchaburee No 6.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The building of the royal palace
and its accompaniments or satellites
on mount Nakawa Kiree was com-
menced, if we recollect rightly, in the
year 1859, and was a little more than
four years in coming to a stage in
which it would be said to be finished.
But the truth is, royal palaces whether
in the city or the country are much
like Buddhist temples in being scarce-
ly ever finished. There were at the
beginning of the work, as we have
been credibly informed, 1000 Lao-
sians called out of their neighboring
villages to do the king's work—-t'am
rachakan-—in the mount 6 months
out of 12. The first thousand were
allowed to be exchanged for a fresh
relay of a second thousand after a
service of two months, and those again
were exchanged for the first thousand
after they had completed the same
term of service; and thus they were
exchanged during the first 12 months.
There were then, it seems, only about
2000 able bodied men of all the Lao-
sians in that quarter, living in six or
eight villages within 15 miles of
the mount. These men were not
only obliged to work without pay,
but also to board themselves far away
from their homes, as also to provide
themselves with nearly all the tools
they needed for their work. Their
work was at first to open a road up
the mount by blasting a way through
the craggy lime stone rocks and thus
prepare it for future flagging with
brick. The blasting was chiefly done
by making large fires in close contact
with the rocks which they wished to
break to pieces. But sometimes they
were too large to be cracked in this
way, and then they would split them
with powder. Having thus cut a zig-
zig way for a road, they were set to
the work of building up the sides of
the cliffs with small stones cemented
together by a composition of lime
sand and molasses. They got their
stones from the rocks as above descri-
bed. We then saw them scattered all
about the mount gathering up stones
and carrying them in baskets swung
on poles resting on the shoulders of
two men. It appeared to us, as in-
deed it was, a very tedious work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The second year government called
out 500 of the Laosians every month,
and so arranged it that every able bo-
died man of the 2000 should do gov-
ernment work on the mount 3 months
of the year. In the third and fourth
years 300 of them were thus employ-
ed every month. According to this
calculation these 2000 Laos men were
taxed the first year with 365,000 days
work—-the 2nd year 182,500, the 3rd
year 109,500 days and the 4th year
the same, making in the aggregate
during those four years the sum total
of 764,500 days equal to 25,483
months or 2,123½ years. Now this ser-
vice, estimated according to the gov-
ernment valuation of the services of
each man, which is 6 ticals per month,
and by which they are allowed to com-
mute their taxes, would amount to the
startling sum of 152,898 ticals, equal
to $91,738. Is not this a crushing
taxation to levy on a class of subjects
whose honesty and good citizenship
has never been surpassed if indeed
equalled by any other class of people
in the kingdom? And yet though
they have groaned under this terrible
oppression, as did the children of Israel
in Egypt, they seem not to have
been diminished by it, but rather in-
creased. They are now a remarkably
hale race of men, and their women
and children appear far more ruddy
than the families of the Siamese who
are their lords. Let it be repeated
and well considered that these 2000
Laosians supported their families and
rendered unrequited service to the
government of the country in the
course of those four years to the a-
mount of 784,500 days which at the
government estimate was worth
$91,738. By this we may see how
much men, even the ignorant heathen
may do for themselves and save for
the public good by the simplest possi-
ble diet and the most rigged economy.
It should be said also to the praise of
those Laosian families that all their men
women and children clothe their per-
sons entirely excepting only their feet,
which their neighbors the Siamese
scarcely never do.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is due to the Siamese govern-
ment to say, that it allows those Lau-
sians to grow all the rice they can
find time for, on government land free
from taxation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It appears from credible data be-
fore us that the Siamese government
has expended on that palace mount
the sum of 3000 changs of silver,
which is 240,000 ticals, equal to
$144,000. Add to this the govern-
ment estimate of the unrequited ser-
vices of the Laotians as above set forth,
and we have the sum of $235,738.
Outside of this sum the king has ex-
pended for making roads, refitting and
garnishing idol caverns in the neigh-
boring mountains large sums of mo-
ney. He seems to have determined
that Petchaburee and its suburbs shall
be a city befitting a heathen king who
has had his mind much enlarged by
European knowledge and science, but
unconverted to christianity. On the
new market which he has caused to
be erected in the city he has expanded
not less, probably, than 2000 changs of
money equal to $96,000. It consists
of two lines of two storied brick buil-
dings, each about half a mile long on
either side of a wide street,—the site
of an old market—which was a mere
jumble of the most rickety sheds and
hovels. The dwellings connected with
them were but little better, and the
street between them was but a narrow
filthy lane. The new street is wide,
well elevated with brick-walled sewers
on either side. The market stalls in front
of the brick buildings are neat and tidy,
and the occupants are obliged to keep
them cleanly and the street well swept.
The rent which the occupants have to
pay government is $3.60 per month
for about 20 feet in length of the block
divided into 3 rooms on the lower
story with the use of 12 feet width
of frontage for exposing their goods
under an awning. It is understood
that they must occupy rooms in the
new buildings if they would continue
to have any part or lot in the business
of the market.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The city proper is on the east side
of the river, (the latter running north,)
and was in ancient time surrounded
by a massive brick wall. But very
little of that wall is now to be seen.
The ruins of it have been removed to
aid in the formation of new brick
buildings not only in the market but
also on the palace mount. Two bridg-
es cross the river, the one most south-
erly being old fashioned and rude, the
other made after European style and
very tasty. This is about 80 yards long
and 10 wide, and connects the most
northern end of the market with good
carriage roads on the west side of the
river leading to the palace mount and
other mounts at the west and N. W.
of the town.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is a stable of royal ponies
near the 6 country palaces of princes
and lords on the west side of the river
containing usually from 20 to 30
steeds of various grades; some of
them being small and but little spirited
and some large and full of mettle.
The establishment cannot properly be
called a livery stable, because the
horses are not kept there for hire, but
only for the use of the king and his
family and princes, nobles and lords.
Still it should be said to the praise of
His Majesty and his ministers in
charge, that no European or Ameri-
can is prohibited the privilege of em-
ploying those ponies if properly ap-
plied for, and with a moderate remu-
neration to the keepers for their troub-
le.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are several very pleasant
routes on which a party may have a
horse back-ride or a drive in a buggy
or palanquin on good roads of many
miles even in the wet season, but in
the dry season they may ride their
ponies in every direction and to any
extent all over the paddy fields. The
road to Ków Lóđang is one among
several others made for the king's es-
pecial accommodation and consequently
a good one of about two miles. It
runs nearly due north from the palace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}mount. Having passed one third of
the distance, you come to a precipi-
tons mount of rocks called Kôw P'ra-nom
qua the sacred mount, being not
less than 60 feet high with a base
of not more, probably, than 30 rods
in circumference. As usual for all
mountain peaks, it has been crowned
with a pagola, and its base furnished
with a few buildings for the accomo-
dation of Buddhist priests and their
followers who would worship Buddh
there. While idolaters have done
what they could to make it a’omin-
able, God its maker has covered it
with his own beautiful shrubbery, and
by their rich foliage, interspersed with
trailing flowers, He speaks to man and
both invites and commands him to
worship only the almighty and etern-
al Spirit who filleth all immensity and
inhabiteth all eternity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The road to Kow Looang passes by
hundreds of rich paddy fields on either
side. When you come to the foot of
the mount a very unique road with
brick steps up a tolerably steep ac-
clivity through a delightful arbor of
the lan toms will invite you strongly
to ascend it, and you will do well to
comply. It will lead you up a hund-
red rods or more to the great subterra-
nean idol galleries which the king
has caused to be swept and garnished
and replenished with idols at great
expense with the view of perpetuating
his name down many future ages as
being the most enlightened king which
Siam has ever had, and yet a stanch
Buddhist. In entering the cave
you descend by one of the natural
sky-light openings down a steep flight
of brick steps a distance of 90 feet
where you arrive, as it were, at the
ante-chamber, and here you are ush-
ered into the presence of giant gilded
images of Buddh, and what purports
to be a fac simile of all the wonder-
ful marks on the soles of his feet by
which his foot prints are ever certain-
ly identified. Thence you go down a
rather steep declivity 10 or 15 feet
through a narrow opening to the
great central circular hall which is
about 100 feet in diameter. It has a
natural sky-light directly over its cen-
tre appropriated wholly to itself, and
probably not less than 100 feet from
the floor. The opening at the top is
nearly a circle, and appears to be 10
feet in diameter. With this exception,
the arched roof of the hall is hung
with the most beautiful stalactites.
On the shrubbery growing around the
sky-light you may see monkeys gain-
bolling and ever and anon peering
down to see what you are doing in
that idolatrous pit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the left hand side of the central
hall as you come into it there is a
narrow avenue leading into another
apartment of that subterranean temple.
By the side of the dark passage on
your right hand as you enter it, lies in
a senseless state, like Buddh in Nip-
pan, an image of Buddh 20 feet in
length and otherwise suitably pro-
portioned. A narrow gate-way con-
ducts you into the 3d hall. This, too,
has its own natural sky-light. In this
apartment there is a little pagoda,
which the king built and honored
a few years since by depositing in it
with his own hands some little specks
of the supposed relics of Buddh’s
bones. They were probably picked
up in that hall, and identified as being
real relics by the little agitation they
are said to have manifested when
touched by lemon juice. Another test
said to be infallible, is, that a speck
of it when put into the eye will pro-
duce no irritation however long it may
remain. At the farther end of the
3d hall there is a long dark passage to
the old entrance which is said to be
haunted by ghosts and devils. One
of our Siamese girls on a certain time
when there with us, affirmed that she
then lost her pahome in a most mis-
terious way while gazing into that
dark passage. It was a human devil
no doubt that took it from her.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Almost every nook and crevice of
these three caverns is occupied by a
gilded image of Buddh of various
dimensions, from that of the recum-
bent monster above mentioned, to
those of four inches in length. There
are many hundreds of them. Most of
the larger ones of the size of man and
children in their teens are sitting, while
the smaller are standing. In this pious
work of garnishing and replenishing
these halls with idols, many princes,
nobles, and lords have vied with one
another in their contributions to it and
have attached their names to the idols
which they have severally made. The
gilding on most of them seems to be
quite rich.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The most truthful remark that can
be made of these things is, that they
are vile abominations, and abhorrent
in the sight of Jehovah the one living
and only true God. But the natural
scenery is rich and well worthy of
being studied by a christian student.
Amateurs in the natural sciences
will find in those caves and many
smaller ones in the same mount a
large and interesting field for inves-
tigation. Should we look into the
hundreds that are said to be in that
mount, we should, in all probability,
find every one a receptacle of images
of Buddh. It is a remarkable fact that
Buddhism always displays her piety
by consecrating to idolatry all the
caverns and peaks of rocky mountains.
If you will but for a moment take a
stroll of five minutes from these caves
to a commanding peak on the same
mount, you will see the ruins of an old
temple made of red free stone and
many mutilated images of Buddh and
imaginary celestial beings as large as
an adult Siamese, in all imaginable
positions and conditions of disgrace.
We once took the head of one of
them and brought it openly down the
hill and exhibited it to a company of
men who were employed in refitting
the great caverns. They took not
the least exception to our carrying
the head home with us, and seemed
to consider the affair as a pleasant
joke. O for the almighty Spirit's
quickening power to turn this deluded
people "from darkness to light and
from the power of satan unto God!"{{< /news/text >}}

The Police Assaulted
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Wednesday last at 1 p.m. two
policemen arrested a Chinaman with
contraband opium, and were taking
him to the police station; but when a
little below Wat Koh the prisoner
threw himself down and, holding on to
a post refused to go further, at the same
time calling loudly for assistance.
When about fifty Chinamen armed
with spears, pikes, three pronged forks,
sharpened bamboos, and a variety of
other weapons suddenly appeared and
attacked the two police men cutting
open the head of the nearest; and leav-
ing him for dead, drove the other to
the nearest bridge, where he was joined
by three other policemen, who drew
their swords and accepted the challenge,
although only 5 to 50. But the nar-
rowness of the street saved the police
from being overpowered by numbers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The policemen knew that to turn and
run was certain death, therefore there
was no choice but to stand their
ground and fight, parrying the thrusts
and attacking in return until the
Chinese turned and fled, leaving pikes
and poles on the ground; they howev-
er succeeded in taking the prisoner
with them. The whole affair lasted
only a few minutes, and when the
main portion of the police reached
the spot all was over. One poor
fellow narrowly escaped being pierced
through by catching hold of a spear
and pushing it on one side. It however
pierced his clothes and his hands suf-
fered from the sharp instrument.
This is the same gang of Chinamen
who attacked the police on two former
occasions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As long as the Government receives
money for the Opium farm, it is bound
to protect it, and this can only be prop-

protect the police from being assaulted
whenever John Chinaman can bring
ten to one against the Police.{{< /news/text >}}

Courrier de Paris
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
From our own Correspondent.
Paris 18th June 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}An opera composed from the "Ara-
bian nights" tales-—Zilda and Mon-
sieur de Flotou—-Story of a Dove
and a parrot—-The new opera by Mons.
Gounod—-Cendrillon at the Chatelet—-
260th anniversary of the birth of Cor-
neille—-The Chinese Ambassadors—-
Suicide—-The Parisian rats.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Summer has at last come upon us—-
with one bound we have passed from
bitter east winds and cold rain, to the
full blaze of a summer sun. The
streets of our capital are dry and dus-
ty and the Parisians are seeking refuge
in the country in order to breathe a
little fresh air.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our theatres are becoming daily
more and more deserted and neverthe-
less several of our literary authors
have deemed the moment a fitting one,
to present some new pieces to the pub-
lic.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus the opera Comique has late-
ly given the first performance of a new
opera, by Flotou entitled Zilda—the
plot of this play is taken from the "A-
rabian nights" and has nothing very
striking about it—-the music however
is bright and sparkling and the piece
has been very well received.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The same theatre also a few days
ago produced a new piece by Gounod
the author of the well known opera
Faust "La Colombe" as the play is
called, it is more properly speaking an
Operetta than an Opera, and is the
story of a wonderful "Dove" the pro-
perty of the owner of the piece. A
young girl with whom the hero is in
love is cruelly tormented by a Parrot
which belongs to one of her rivals.
By means of the gentle Dove, the fair
lady is delivered from her enemy, and
the play ends as most plays end by
happiness and marriage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The theatre of the Chatelet has at
last eclipsed that of the Porte St. Mar-
tin, by the production of a new piece
feerique entitled Cendrillon which
out-rivals in splendour the Biche au
Bois.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Alas we must own with shame, that
we live in a very degenerate age, our
Parisian public no longer cares for the
intellectual, and we are far from the
days when the first representation of a
new play was hissed or applauded ac-
cording as it displayed more or less
talent on the part of the author. For
a play now-a-days to have a successful
run in our Paris theatre, it must be
resplendent, not with talent, but with
magnificent tableaux, rich dresses, lights
etc. which strike the eye and mask the
puerile nature of the plot.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is true, that there still exists a
small number of persons who have a
love of the true literature of the stage
and have not yet learned to scoff at the
writings of Moliere, Racine and
Corneille.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These chosen few, a short time ago,
celebrated the 260th anniversary of
the birth of Corneille by the represen-
tation of the "Cid" at the Theatre Fran-
cais in which the great Italian trajedian
Rossi performed with great success.
After the play was ended the bust
of Corneille was solemnly crowned with
flowers amidst thunders of applause.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The financial world of Paris has
been lately much occupied with an af-
fair of forgery, on which a well known
banker Mons. Richard plays the princi-
pal role. It appears that the above
named gentleman had endorsed forged
bills of exchange, for the amount of
nearly four millions of francs. Find-
ing that the affair was discovered and
that it was impossible for him to es-
cape the hands of justice, M. Richard
went to a Maison des Bains where he
endeavored to commit suicide, 1st by
hanging himself with his cravat, 2nd
by opening his veins with a pen knife,
and third by drowning himself in the
bath. In each of these attempts he
was unsuccessful and whilst in the act
of endeavouring to drown himself, the
door of the bathroom was burst open
by the police and he was conveyed to
the prison of Mazras where he now
awaits his trial.{{< /news/text >}}

of their dresses and the brilliancy of

costumes were made.

wonder and admiration, and caused
them to extul the superiority of Ce-
lestial workmanship were all, simply
the produce of one of our great manu-
factories at Lyons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The truth is that when the Chinese
envoys arrived in Paris—they discov-
ered to their great dismay that their
costumes had been so saturated with
salt water during their long voy-
age as to be utterly ruined, where-
at they were plunged into despair.
However the landlord of the Grand
Hotel, came to their aid. By his advice
orders were immediately dispatched to
Lyons for a quantity of rich silk, and
after a few days our celestial friends
were enabled to make their appearance
in the street of our capital, clothed in
the above named robes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our Paris papers have for the last
few days been filled with accounts
of the devastations caused by the
rats—the vast demolitions which are
being carried on, force these animals
to change their quarters and those per-
sons who happen to be in the streets at
a late hour of the night, frequently
meet with whole troops of rats in full
march to seek a new home, where they
may have a little rest and quiet{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}It is very clear that all drunkards were

Why Hogs eat Ashes, Etc.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Mechi, of Tip-Tree Hall, Eng-
land, has discovered that pigs, when shut
up to fatten, are fond of cinders, and
improve in condition by eating a certain
portion of them every day. Some persons
are unable to account for this singular
propensity in swine. Poultry are very
fond of eggshells, lime, sand, etc., and it
is well-known these substances are neces-
sary in order to form the shell of eggs,
and to furnish materials for the bones of
fowls. Is it not reasonable to suppose
that swine eat ashes and cinders for the
purpose of supplying materials for their
bones, and this singular instinct for ani-
mals so low in the scale of intelligence, is
truly wonderful; for ashes contain the
ingredients which are necessary to form
bones, viz: clay, silica gelatinized, and
made soluble by fire. When hogs are at
large, they take in clay and silica with
their food, and eat bones and roots which
contain the necessary ingredients; but
when they are pent up, they endeavour to
supply the materials necessary for keep-
ing up their frames, by devouring ashes
and cinders. Let them have plenty of
them.—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Horses I learned to govern by the law

established between man and horse, there

The man wills whither; the horse, at the

thither. I became, very early, Hippoda-
mos, not by force but by kindness. All
lower beings—fiendish beings apart—un-
less spoiled by treachery, seek the society
of the higher; as man, by nature loves
God. Horses do all they know for man,
if man will only let them. All they need
is a slight hint to help their silly, willing
brains, and they dash with order at their
business of galloping a mile a minute, or
twenty miles an hour or of leaping a gal-
ling or pulling tonnage. They put so much
rock-less, break-neck frenzy in their at-
tempts to please and obey the royal per-

Onions and Poultry.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Scarcely too much can be said in praise
of onions for fowls. They seem to be a
preventive and remedy for various dis-
eases to which domestic fowls are liable.
Having frequently tested their excellen-
cies, we can speak understandingly. For
gapes and inflammation of the throat,
eyes,—-and head, onions are almost a
specific. We would therefore, recom-
mend giving fowls, and especially young
chickens, as many as they will eat, as of-
ten as twice a week.—-They should be
finely chopped. A small addition of
cornmeal is an improvement.—-Genessee

Testimony to Missions from

{{< news/text >}}It would be difficult to find a volume
which cuts more completely across the
silly popular platitude that missions to
the heathen are useless, and that the wise
should confine themselves to our own
heathen at home. It is strange that, if a
man goes merely to hunt, or to make
geographical discoveries, he is loudly ap-
pleaded by the very people who speak
slightingly of missionaries. To bring
home hundreds of tusks, and teeth, and
skins, or to show where a river rises, and
what is the altitude of a mountain range,
is thought a noble achievement ; but to
have crossed the plains where the eleph-
ants range, and to have ascended those
unknown heights in order to give the
greatest of blessings to the men who live
there, is thought Quixotic, and deroga-
tory to the wisdom of civilized man. The
real facts are just the other way.-—LON-

To Prevent the Loss of Aro-
ma in Roasting Coffee.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The berries of coffee once roasted,
lose every hour somewhat of their aroma,
in consequence of the influence of the
oxygen of the air, which, owing to the
porosity of the roasted berries, it can
easily penetrate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This pernicious change may best be
avoided by strewing over the berries,
when the roasting is completed, and while
the vessel in which it has been done is
still hot, some powdered white or brown
sugar (half an ounce to one pound of
coffee is sufficient). The sugar melts im-
mediately, and by well shaking or turning
the toaster quickly, it spreads over all
the berries, and gives each one a fine
glaze, impervious to the atmosphere.
They have then a shining appearance, as
though covered with a varnish, and they
in consequence lose their smell entirely,
which, however, returns in a high degree
as soon as they are ground.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After this operation, they are to be
shaken out rapidly from the toaster and
spread out on a cold plate of iron, so that
they may cool as soon as possible. If the
hot berries are allowed to remain heaped
together, they begin to sweat, and when
the quantity is large, the heating process,
by the influence of air, increases to such
a degree that at last they take fire spon-
taneously. The roasted and glazed ber-
ries should be kept in a dry place, be-
cause the covering of sugar attracts mois-
ture.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}For special cases, such as journeys and
marches, where it is impossible to be
burdened with the necessary machines
for roasting and grinding, coffee may be
carried in a powdered form, and its aro-
matic properties preserved by the follow-
ing process :—One pound of the roasted
berries are reduced to powder, and im-
mediately wetted with a sirup of sugar,
obtained by pouring on three ounces of
sugar two ounces of water, letting them
stand a few minutes. When the powder
is thoroughly wetted with the sirup, two
ounces of finely-powdered sugar are to
be added, mixed well with it, and the
whole is then to be spread out in the air
to dry. The sugar locks up the volatile
parts of the coffee, so that when it is dry
they cannot escape. If coffee is now to
be made, cold water is to be poured over
a certain quantity of the powder, and
made to boil. Ground coffee prepared in
this way, and which lay exposed to the
air for one month, yielded on being boil-
ed as good a beverage as one made of
freshly-roasted berries.—-LIEBIO.{{< /news/text >}}

Meeting at the Top.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A hundred years ago, and more, a nu-
merous body of Presbyterians who had
seceded from the Established Church of
Scotland, was split in two on a quarrel
about a clause in the oath required of the
freemen of certain Scottish boroughs,
which expressed "their hearty allowance
of the true religion at present professed
within the realm, and authorized by the
laws thereof." The party who held that
the oath might be conscientiously taken by
seceders were called "Burghers," and their
opponents "Anti-burghers." Johnny Mor-
ton, a keen Burgher, and Andrew Gebbie,
a decided Anti-burgher, both lived in the
same house, but at opposite ends, and it
was the bargain that each should keep his
own side of the house well thatched.
When the dispute about the principle of
their kirks, and especially the offensive
clause in the oath, grew hot, the two neigh-
bours ceased to speak to each other.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But one day they happened to be on the
roof at the same time, each repairing the
thatch in the slope of the roof on his own
side, and when they had worked up to the
top, there they were face to face. They
could not flee, so at last Andrew took off
his cap, and scratching his head, said,
"Johnnie, you and me, I think, has been
very foolish to dispute, as we has done,
concerning Christ's will about our kirks,
until we has clean forgot His will about
ourselves; and so we has fought sae bitter-
ly for what we ca' the truth, that it has
ended in spite. What ever's wrang, it's
perfectly certain that it never can be
right to be uncivil, unneighbourly, unkind,
in fac, tae hate ane anither. Na, na, that's
the deevil's work, and no God's. Noo, it
strikes me that may be it's wi' the kirk as
wi' this house; your working on ae side
and me on the ither, but if we only do
our work weel, we will meet at the tap at
last. Gie's your hand, auld neighbour!"
And so they shook han', and were the best
o' freens ever after.{{< /news/text >}}

The Mute Detective.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}"No dogs admitted, sir," said the port-

appeared at the entrance. "You must
leave him behind if you go in."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Very well," said the young man.
"Stay about here, Prince, till I come
back."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And he joined the crowd within; but
by and by the young man wished to re-
fer to his watch, when behold! the chain
had been snapped in two, and the valuable
time-piece was gone. He considered the
case a moment and then a sudden thought
flashed in his mind. So, stepping out,
he whispered the fact to the porter, and
gained permission to take his dog in for
a minute or two.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Look here, Prince," said he, "you
knowing dog, my watch is stolen;" and
he showed him the empty pocket and the
cut chain. "Do you understand, old
fellow? In there, sir, is the thief. You
find it my good doggie, and I'll get you
a famous treat. You understand, do
you?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prince wagged his head and tail, and
gave his master a wonderful knowing
look, and then he stole quietly into the
place again. Quietly this dumb detective
glided around among the people, smelling
at this one's chain, until at last he sets
his teeth into the coat tail of a genteel-
looking man, and could not be shaken
off. The young man quietly made known
the case to the bystanders who gathered
around him, and he had the thief's pocket
duly searched. Six other watches were
found upon him, which he had gathered
up in course of the morning, and which
the rightful owners were glad to get
their hands on again. Prince selected
out his master's property in a twinkling,
as that was all he cared for and he gave
it to him joyfully. It would have taken
a very keen police to do work so neatly
and quickly; and all agreed that he
merited as good a dinner as a dog could
have. A good beef bone and a bowl of
milk satisfied his wants, and then he was
just as ready to do the same favor again.{{< /news/text >}}

to support a wife." In one case in three,
perhaps, this may be so; but, as a general
thing, the true reply would be, "I am
not able to support the style in which I
think my wife ought to live." In this
again we see a false view of marriage—-a
looking to an appearance in the world,
instead of a union with a loving woman
for her own sake. There are very few
men of industrious habits, who cannot
maintain a wife, if they are willing to
live economically, and without reference
to the opinion of the world. The great
evil is, they are not content to begin life
humble, to retire together into an obscure
position, and together work their way in
the world-—he by industry in his calling,
and she by dispensing with prudence the
money that he earns. But they must
stand out and attract the attention of
others by the fine houses and fine clothes.{{< /news/text >}}

Musk.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Empress Josephine was very fond
of perfumes, and, above all, of musk. Her
dressing-room at Malmaison was filled
with it, in spite of Napoleon's frequent
remonstrances. Forty years have elapsed
since her death, and the present owner of
Malmaison has had the walls of that dress-
ing-room repeatedly washed and painted ;
but neither scrubbing, aquafortis, nor
paint has been sufficient to remove the
smell of the good Empress's musk, which
continues as strong as if the bottle which
contained it had been but yesterday re-
moved.{{< /news/text >}}

True Cheerfulness.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Along with humility, we should culti-
vate cheerfulness. Humility has no con-
nexion with pensive melancholy, or timo-
rous dejection. While the truly humble
guard against the distraction of all vio-
lent passions and inordinate cares, they
cherish a cheerful disposition of mind.
There cannot, indeed, be genuine cheerful-
ness without the approbation of our own
heart. While, however, we pay a sacred
regard to conscience, it must be enlighten-
ed and directed by reason and revelation.
And happy are the individuals who can
say: "Our rejoicing is this, the testimony
of our conscience, that, in simplicity and
godly sincerity, we have had our conversa-
tion in the world." An approving mind
will contribute greatly to cheerfulness,
and that equanimity which results from it,
from trust in God, and from the hope of a
blessed immortality, is equally remote
from sour dissatisfaction, desponding
melancholy, and frivolous hilarity. It
smooths our path and sweetens our cup,
rendering duty easy and affliction light.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}-—To cure Dyspepsia, take a new axe,
put a white hickory handle in it, bore a
hole in the top of the handle, fill the hole
with gum camphor, and seal it up—Then
take the axe and cut cord wood until the
heat of the handle dissolves the camphor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-The lady who did not think it res-

has lately heard from her two sons.
One of them is a barkeeper on a flat-boat,
and the other is steward in a brick yard.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-One of the best bits ever made, at
an impropriety in a lady's dress, was made
by Tallyrand. During the revolution,
when asked by a lady his opinion of her
dress, he replied, “it began too late and
ended too soon.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—As one single drop of black ink will
tinge and pollute a vessel of crystal water,
so one little act of faithlessness may ir-

purest friendship and confidence.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—The Marquis d'Harcourt walking
arm-in-arm with Voltaire, a person took
off his hat to the marquis, who returned
the salute. “Why did you bow to that
fellow,” says Voltaire, “he is one of the
greatest blackguards of the day.” “What
of that?” replied the marquis, “I would
not allow a blackguard to out-do me as a
gentleman.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-A rural genius has invented a plan
to prevent chickens from scratching
gardens. The plan is to secure a stick
to the heels of the fowl, so that as the
foot is raised the stick falls and strikes
the ground, throwing the chicken for-
ward. Repeated efforts to scratch will
cause the chickens to walk clear out of
the garden.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—John Randolph met a personal en-
emy in the street one day, who refused
to give him half the side walk, saying
that he never turned out for a rascal.
“I do!” said Randolph, stepping aside,
and politely raising his hat; “pass on,
sir—pass on, sir!”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—President Lincoln used to tell this
story of himself. He was riding one day
on the top of a stage-coach in Illinois,
when the driver asked him to “treat.”
“I never use liquor,” was Mr. Lincoln's
reply, “and I cannot induce others to do
so.” “Don't you chew neither?” said
the driver. “No sir; I never use tobac-
co in any form. “Well,” remarked the
disgusted John, “I hain't got much
opinion of these fellows with no small
vices; they usually make it up in big
ones.”{{< /news/text >}}

remark about the length of the speeches
made in Parliament, which is applicable
to the efforts of many of our public men:
“If some of the speeches of our states-
men do not teach down to posterity, it
will not be because they are not long
enough.”{{< /news/text >}}

grapes?” “I suppose, my dear, the hens
picked them off,” was her moderate reply.
“Hens—hens—some two legged hens, I

“My dead, did you ever see any other
kind?”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—Every morning we enter upon a new
day which carries a yet unknown future
in its bosom. Thoughts may be born to-day
which may never expire; hopes may be
excited which may never be extinguished;
and acts may be performed to-day, the
consequence of which cannot be realised
till that day when the “secrets of all
hearts shall be made known.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—The Savior has, indeed, said “nar-
row is the way that leadeth unto life.”
He has never told us, however, that it is
a thorny road. It is unbelief in and out
of the church, and not in God, that has
represented it as such a road. In denying
ourselves and taking up the cross as re-
quired, Christ promises us not sorrow and
sighing, but joy unspeakable and full of
glory; not weariness, but rest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}-—Sir Walter Scott once happening to
hear his daughter Anne say of something
that it was “vulgar,” gave the young
lady the following temperate rebuke:
“My love, you speak like a very young
lady. Do you know, after all, the mean-
ing of this word vulgar? Tis only com-
mon. Nothing that is common except
wickedness, can deserve to be spoken of
in a tone of contempt; and when you
have lived to my years, you will be dis-
posed to agree with me in thanking God
that nothing really worth having or car-
ing about in this world is uncommon.”{{< /news/text >}}
