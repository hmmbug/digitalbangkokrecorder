{{< news/text >}}The Message of President Johnson
seems to have had a very salutary ef-
fect throughout the country. It is
regarded as an able State paper, paci-
fic in tone, and calculated to contri-
bute materially to the restoration of
good feeling between the two sections
lately in conflict, and to allay much of
the apprehensions of foreign compli-
cation previously felt. Its effect upon
Congress is said to have been impor-
tant, and the Conservative Republi-
cans seem to have been in many cases
influenced thereby to adopt a more
conciliatory course towards the South.
South. It is currently reported that
the joint resolution prescribing the
test oath of having never aided the re-
bellion as a requisite for admission to
Congress will be greatly modified. Its
enforcement would have excluded
from that body nearly all the recently
elected members from the Southern
States. It seems possible now that
their credentials may be received dur-
ing the session.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Both Houses of Congress have re-
quested the President to furnish all
correspondence touching the French
occupation of Mexico, Maximilian's
decree ordering armed Republicans to
be shot without trial, and the estab-
lishment of Peonage. Another reso-
lution, strongly pointed against Mexi-
co, was introduced in the House and
laid over.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Charleston correspondent of
the 'Herald' asserts that General Grant,
in the course of conversation at the
dinner given by General Sickles, stated
that now was the favorable moment
to drive Maximilian from Mexico, and
that such an opportunity might not
occur again. General Grant has re-
turned to Washington, and reports
that the negroes are in comparative
idleness and refused to renew their
contracts. He believes that the pro-
fessions of loyalty expressed by the
Sothern masses are sincere.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A bill had been introduced into the
House of Representatives, providing
for the payment to Mrs. Lincoln of
the sum of 100,000 dollars, being the
salary of her husband for the four
years' term for which he was last
elected. The bill was referred to a
committee of one from each State.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Provisional Governor Perry, of South
Carolina, recently received the follow-
ing telegram from the President:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I do not think it necessary for
the members elect from South Caro-
lina to be present at the organization
of Congress. On the contrary, it will
be better policy to present their certi-
ficates of election after the two Houses
have been organized, which will then be
a simple question under the constitu-
tion of the members taking their seats.
Each House must judge for itself the
election returns and qualifications of
its own members. As to what the two
Houses will do in reference to the
oath required to be taken by members
is unknown to me, and I do not like
to predict. But, upon the whole, I
am of the opinion it would be better
for the question to come up after
Congress has been organised. I hope
that your legislature will adopt a code
in reference to free persons of colour
that will be acceptable to the country,
and at the same time do justice to the
white and coloured population..{{< /news/text >}}

Overland Trade Report
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}1st Feb. 1866{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The northern news of the fortnight
which has just elapsed is full of rumours
concerning rebel movements. The
Nienfei are said to be on the neigh-
bourhood of the Grand Canal, about
300 li, north of the Yangtze. They
are described as pushing steadily south-
wards and as having inflicted defeats on
the Imperial troops. Very late news
from Hankow, brought by a steamer
which left that place on the 21st, relates
to further rebel movements. A large
force was within 30 miles of the city,
and one of the chief imperialist generals
had gone over to the enemy. The
Taoutai had applied for help to all the
foreign consuls. The gunboat Algerine
lying at Kewkiang proceeded immedi-
ately to Hankow. The French gunboat
Fardif was already at Hankow. Re-
fugees were flocking into the foreign
settlement from all directions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From Chinkiang there are accounts
of a new canal on a large scale which
is under construction. It is on the
South Bank, just above the British
Concession, and is intended for the
shelter of native craft from the north
winds when the proclamation ordering
them to quit the north side shall be
enforced. About 2,000 men are kept
constantly at work, and though the
canal cannot be thoroughly finished un-
der two years it will, it is said, be
ready for partial use in a month's time.
The idea is to connect Nankin with
Chinkiang. At Nankin the authorities
have issued an edict taking off all duties
from silks woven there for five years,
and a great effect has been produced.
No fewer than 2,500 silk looms have
been established in the place in six
months. Six or seven hundred extra
looms are at work at Chinkiang and
the number of junks on the north side,
has increased marvellously. They lie
all along the river bank for more than
a mile, in tiers 18 to 23 deep.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Piratical operations have been very
active during the past fortnight. A
French brig the Jeanne et Joseph
which left Hongkong for Takao on the
16th instant, came to anchor in the
Ly-ee-moon passage off Tamtoo for
the night and was attacked by three
junks at about 8 o'clock in the evening.
About two hundred men boarded her
and overpowered resistance. Every-
thing of value was taken from her; but
the pirates, before they had quite
completed their work were interrupted
by the accidental appearance of a
Spanish war steamer, the Circe. They
made off, and the Circe lay alongside
the brig all night. Next day the Jeanne
et Joseph returned to Hongkong hav-
ing lost two of her men in the attack.
On the 21st another successful achieve-
ment of the pirates was announced
by the reappearance in the harbor of
the American schooner Alma. The
previous day she had sailed for Japan
and was attacked outside the Ly-ee-
moon. Her captain and crew escaped
in boats having the pirates at leisure
but after robbing the vessel of all she
contained, they turned her adrift, and
she was brought into Hongkong by the
crew of a passing vessel. Not content
with these two feats, the pirates at-
tempted a still bolder exploit. They
actually boarded a German barque, the
Albert Fures as she lay at anchor in
the harbor, near Stone Cutter island.
This was done during the night of the
23rd. There were a few chests of
opium on board, and the intention
probably was to kill the anchor watch,
—one man,—before he could give the
alarm and carry off the plunder without
the knowledge of the crew. The man
on watch, however, though severely
wounded, defended his life, and the
noise aroused his shipmates and also
excited the attention of the next vessel.
The pirates took themselves off there-
fore this time unsuccessful.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Macao is gradually loosing its old
character for orderly propriety. Kid-
napping Chinese for the coolie trade
is carried to a fearful extent. Boat
loads of men are being brought in from
the west coast almost daily. In the
town itself rowdyism is beginning, and
respectable Europeans go about armed.
The China boys employed in steamers
visiting the port are afraid to go on
shore for fear of being kidnapped.{{< /news/text >}}

five cents each, amounting in one year

each meal, counting up in the course
of the year to $54,75; keep a big dog,
which will consume in a year at least
$15 worth of provisions; and a cat $4
more—-altogether this amounts to the
snug sum of $110.25—-sufficient to buy
six barrels of flour, one hundred bush-
els of coal, and a barrel of sugar, one
sack of coffee and a good coat, a re-
spectable dress, besides a frock for the
baby, and a half a dozen pairs of shoes
—more or less. Just think of it.{{< /news/text >}}

February 22nd 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Never would we forget when we
write, or see, or think of the date above
given, that it points to the anniversary
of the birth of the immortal GEORGE
WASHINGTON one hundred and thirty
four years since—-a name that will
ever become more and more illustrious
while the principles of free government
shall continue to deepen, and streng-
then, and expand, until, as we, firmly
believe, they will, like Nebuchadnez-
zer’s mountain, "fill the whole earth."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The arrival of the Siamese Steamer
“Chow Phya” on the eve of the 17th
inst, brought for our small foreign
community here but a meagre European
Mail. Our latest dates from London
are to Dec. 26th, and from the U. S.
Am. to the 6th of Dec. We think
that we have in the late news both from
Europe and America peculiar reasons
for uniting with the sweet Psalmist of
Israel in the sentiment—-“The Lord
reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the
multitude of isles be glad thereof”
We see Him at the helm of all the
governments in Europe guiding them
to his own praise and glory, and con-
tinually assuring them that He will
cause all things to work together for
the good of His people. Most signally
did He interpose and arrest the rising
of a rebellion in Ireland, which, had
it been left to expend and strengthen
a few months more, would in all prob-
ability have done infinite damage to
England, to the U. S. Am., and to the
world. We rejoice to see, as we think
we do, among nearly all the nations of
Europe the principles of liberty and
freedom in human governments rapid-
ly gaining ground over oppression and
absolutism. Peculiarly glad are we
to notice the great expansion and power
and blessings of Republicanism in the
U. S. While we are pained at seeing
that many of the bitter and dangerous
roots of slavery are still living in the
hearts of men at the North and in the great
majority of the South we foresee a day
not far off, when they shall all be erad-
icated, and the coloured race univer-
sally acknowledged to be in the fullest
sense citizens of that great Republic.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have read the message of Pres-
ident Johnson with much satisfaction
and see good reason why the first tel-
egraphic reports of it to all parts of
the world represented it as being very
generally commended in the U. S. and
commanding the high regards of nearly
or quite all the European powers. It
is indeed “an able state paper”
being another grand proof that its
author is an extraordinary man and
that he can and does grace well the
Presidential chair. But there are a few
paragraphs in the message with which
we cannot coincide. The one in which
the President apologizes for not hav-
ing taken any steps to extend the elec-
tive franchise to some, at least, of the
more worthy freedmen of the South,
appears to us strangely weak. He seems
to us to have utterly failed to
prove that the constitution stood in
his way of taking any such steps. And
his reasoning to show that the south-
ern States will ultimately give the
freedmen the right of suffrage, is as
“chaff before the summer threshing
floors.” While the old spirit of slavery
is but smothered in the bosoms of at
least three-fourths of their old mas-
ters, as is but too plainly manifested, it
is vain to think that they will allow
the blacks to stand up with them as
their equals at the ballot box. And
such is the nature of this accursed
spirit that it descends from the fathers
to the children, and if the question be
left for the whites at the South to set-
tle for themselves, we may look in
vain for their sons or their son’s sons
to give suffrage to the coloured race.
Nothing short of another terrible
struggle like that through which Slav-
ery and Freedom have just passed in
the U. S. will, in our humble opinion,
ever do it if this glorious opportunity,
opened by the most signal interposi-
tion of the Almighty be neglected.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}President Johnson certainly had the
power and the right to elevate the
status of all the freedmen to at least
the grade of the poorest and most
illiterate white men, giving them the
best of guarantees that an ordinary
education and loyal behavior will
bring them all to the ballot box, and
allow them to vote for their own ru-
lers with privileges and honors equal
to their white neighbours. But since
President Johnson has lost that op-
portunity, Congress now assembled, we
are happy to hope and believe, will
embrace it, and promptly do the freed-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}men that justice which the U. S. gov-
ernment has solemnly promised them,
and which Holy Heaven will insist
upon.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It did our hearts good to read
the report of an Am. correspondent
to, the London Times of which we
give an extract below. The writer
seems to speak of the Radicals, much
in the sense of the old slang "Rabid
abolitionist." We glory in belonging
to the radical party. It was the radi-
cals that elected and re-elected the
illustrious Lincoln and placed by his
side Andrew Johnson, and that sus-
tains him in his most responsible po-
sition. The war for subduing
the great Rebellion, and for the glori-
ous work of destroying slavery was a
radical work, and was waged by
radical men. And the same radicals
are called of God now to eradicate
all the remaining bitter roots of sla-
very, and we have lively hope in God
that they will do it quickly and in it
well.{{< /news/text >}}

Philadelphia, Dec. 4th.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Federal Congress, which assem-
bled in Washington to-day at 12
o'clock noon, began a Session that will
no doubt be among the most impor-
tant in American history. The Pres-
ident having gone over to the Radic-
als on the question of admitting the
Southern members, the Republicans
commence their long winter's work
with apparent harmony, and have laid
down their plan of operations upon
the reconstruction question in the
following resolution:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Resolved by the Senate and House
of Representatives of the United States
in Congress assembled, that a joint
committee of 15 members shall be ap-
pointed, nine of whom shall be mem-
bers of the House and six of the
Senate, who shall inquire into the
condition of the States which formed
the so-called Confederate States of
America, and report whether they or
any of them are entitled to be repre-
sented in either House of Congress,
with leave to report at any time, by
Bill or otherwise; and until such re-
port shall have been made and finally
acted upon by Congress, no member
shall be received into either House
from any of the said so called Con-
federate States, and papers relating to
the representatives of the said States
shall be referred to the said committee
without debate."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This resolution was unanimously
adopted in a caucus of 124 Radical
and Conservative Republican members
of the House of Representatives, and
was concurred in by a large majority
of the senators. It has not yet been
finally acted upon by Congress, and,
although strenuous opposition is made
to it by the Democratic members, its
friends, having so large a majority, it
must ultimately pass. The President
may or not sign it, but the pro-
babilities are strong that in his pre-
sent temper he will sign it. The
resolution is a complete disposal of
the case of every Southern member.
It permits no debate and no alterna-
tive. No matter how strong the
claims of any Southerner, it removes
him at once from the halls of Congress
to a close committee room, where 15
men can vote him in or out of
Congress. Thaddeus Stevens, of
Pennsylvania, a Radical Republican,
is the mover of this resolution, and
will be chairman of the committee,
and the majority of the member ap-
pointed upon it will be as Radical as
he is. There is little chance of the
admission of any Southern members
for weeks to come.{{< /news/text >}}

Correspondence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}To the Editor of the Bangkok Recorder.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir,-—Your last issue contained two
articles the one signed Penelope Brown,
the other unsigned, which having com-
menced and laid aside as more full of
words than good matter, I was in-
duced to read through on hearing that
they contained an assertion most in-
jurious and insulting to this commun-
ity, which ought not to be let pass
without reply.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The two articles in question are so
similar in tone that I shall deal with
them in connection.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The one written immediately after
an excellently managed Ball at the
British Consulate, at which almost ev-
ery European and American of any
standing in this town was present,
complains of the evil of “promiscuous”
dancing. It does not argue against
the practice of dancing or give proofs
of its alleged immoral tendencies, but
assumes the wickedness and condemns
those who indulge in it, condemning
at the same time all those nations
dwelling in temperate climes, who find
the pleasant harmonious action of the
dance a relaxation from dull routine
constitutional walking and riding. If
Penelope Brown will resort to argu-
ment in support of her tirade I should
like her to shew that the races among
which dancing is not a general and
popular recreation are more moral, or
in any way better, or in most things
so good as those among which it is.
I must however protest against her
using ambiguous adjectives such as
"promiscuous" for while her use of
that word may only refer to gentlemen
dancing with ladies instead of by
themselves, it may be taken and in,
this case has been taken, to infer an
unsuitable association of persons such
as does not occur at any of the Balls
given by the ladies or gentlemen of
Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is very kind of Penelope to hope
that some other means may be devised
of bringing harmoniously, if not prom-
iscuously together this little commun-
ity. We can join as we did before in
a social meeting, with perhaps a cup
of tea and a speech by some orator
unknown to fame on liberty or any
other of those fine subjects which ev-
ery talker can get impassioned about.
But if we join in such things good-
humouredly for the sake of good fel-
lowship, we in return shall expect
Penelope to smile on our way of
amusing ourselves. Probably the mu-
sic which excites us to dance might
not be disagreeable to her; she must
have some music in her, - though moved
but little she surely is not akin to
those of whom Shakespeare wrote{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—'The man that hath no music in his soul,
And is not moved by concourse of sweet sounds
Is fit for treasons, plots, conspiracies'{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now for the other letter that
quotes a proverb that eight years ago
a sober European after dinner was a
curiosity. And adds that the statement
might now be applied with more truth
than poetry.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A resident since the beginning of
1857 I probably know more about
this place than our unknown accuser,
who must be a later immigrant, and
my testimony is, first, that I have never
heard of such a proverb and believe it
to be either the writer's own coining,
or the dictum of a peculiar set I do
not associate with. Secondly, with re-
spect to the charge I say it is an un-
just one. It is true that some of the
younger men in the place have been
at times wild and noisy, so young men
are every where, and it is undeniable
that in the old time there was a set of
rowdies here much given to intoxica-
tion, but they were not the communi-
ty, they were only a bad part of it,
which very quickly got weeded out.
They were the exception, not the rule,
and their presence did not justify such
an accusation against the community
as a body. So much for the first part
of the charge, which the writer, it is
presumed, got from others; for the sec-
ond part he is himself responsible. Let
him go night after night from dining
room to dining along the East Bank of
the river (not the west Bank where
he will find few but missionaries,
whose habits I am unacquainted) and
he will learn that drunkenness is now
very rare indeed among our residents;
and even the hotels, are quiet and re-
spectable. If he will only observe facts,
and try to curb his nasty unpoetical
imagination, he will, perhaps, one day
see that this is not such a bad com-
munity after all, though it occasionally
indulges in dinner parties and Balls,
but that it contains many very worthy
men and women outside that little
circle where he and Penelope have
been nourishing their unkindly feelings{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Mr. Editor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}During the Chinese holidays we
enjoyed a little respite at this end of
town, from noise, dust, and smoke:
but the rice mills have started up again,
and things have assumed their usual
activity. John Chinaman however was
again triumphant, which is another
evidence that, in a certain sense, he
rules Siam. We are certainly very much
dependent upon him here as a "hewer
of wood and drawer of water." Indeed
he is the great producer of the king-
dom. Feeling conscious of his im-
portance, he was not going to be
cheated out of his holiday sports, and
when he sets his mind upon play it
takes a pretty good force to change it.
Some of the rice mills had a kind of
hope that they would be able to keep
going during the holidays, and had
secured a quantity of paddy ahead, but
even then they found it impossible
to run without John's assistance. The
noise of exploding fire crackers, the
loads of pork, and sweet meats continu-
ally passing along, proved clearly that
he was determined to have his feast,
and fun, and let the rest of the world jog
on as best it could without him. Still, if
he would do nothing worse than play,
we could not complain. When he does
work he works well, and we must
give him time to play. True, he will
not hang on as tenaciously as a Euro-
pean, but still he makes an excellent
coolie. Whilst Paddy is so taken up
with Fenianisim in the Eastern ports
of the United States, John is gradually
working him out of business in the
great West. A late paper states that
there are at present some ten thousand
Chinamen at work on the new Pacific
Rail Road.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The following extract translated from
a government document prepared for our
Siamese paper and published in our last
issue on the 15th inst. indicates pretty
clearly which way the wind blows and
whence it cometh. It is manifestly in-
tended to cramp the freedom of our
press.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A Government Document.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Translated for the Recorder.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}In cases of litigation in the city or
out of the city where the lawyers and
judges adjudicate not according to
justice, and either of the parties feel
aggrieved he has the privilege of ap-
pealing to the court of the deputy
governor or governor of the province in
which he lives, or to the court of any
high officer in the province. And then,
if he think any such court has not
done him justice through carelessness
or neglect or through some misunder-
standing, the king in great mercy has
been pleased to provide another mode
of redress which is as follows.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whoever of the people or subjects of
the kingdom, without respect of per-
sons—all whoever they may be, that are
engaged in lawsuits, and feel themsel-
ves oppressed by lawyers and judges
in whatever court, let them make a
written complaint and present it to
the king when he comes out to his
seat called Sóót-t'ie-sa wán (on certain
days every waxing and waning moon
—-about 4 times a month) or he may
send the written complaint by the hand
of any relative, or by any lord or
noble or less honorable personage out
of the royal harem or within it, at any
time above indicated. The king will
then attend to all such complaints,
and cause the matter to be truthfully
investigated and justice done.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But to reject this course, and go
and publish the matter in the “papers,”
causing odium to fall upon the judges
and upon their antagonists is the same
as placarding such persons. There-
fore whoever hires his complaints to be
printed is a transgressor, and he
will only defeat his own cause. He is
like one who beats his own legs until
they are bruised and broken.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Newspapers are continually
murmuring complaints of wicked con-
duct at Máaklawng. There is proba-
bly much truth in them. The govern-
or of that Province has within his juris-
diction many bands of lawless men,
who oppress the people and disturb
greatly the peace of the community.
Very many cases of litigation have
come up from that quarter—some of
murder, and some of the violent seiz-
ure of young women and the conse-
quent crimes. Complaint of such
crimes having been made in due form,
the cases were long under adjudication,
first in the court of the P'rák'lang in
this city and then in the court of the
Lord Mayor. But when appeals were
made directly to the king, thorough
trials were instituted. Judgment ren-
dered, and punishment inflicted upon
the offenders in front of the throne
Sóót-t'ie-sa wán. There have been
many such cases.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Concerning the case reported in the
papers to have been adjudicated
through the influence of bribes, the
report is true. The old judge who
was bribed was connected with the
court of the P'rá-k'lang. His title
was P'rá P'ep'aksá. He came before
the king and testified that the man
and the girl truly loved each other
—-that the man did not take her for-
cibly from her parents, and that subse-
quently, the girl, changing her mind,
testified before the court that she had
never loved the man. This testimony
of the judge was found to be false,
and that he had indeed been influenced
by bribes in deciding the case as he
did. Judgment was accordingly rend-
ered in favor of the girl, and the man
who had forced her away from her
parents was imprisoned and the old
judge was degraded from his office.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now this is but an illustration of
the proper mode of procedure, in all
cases of complicated litigation where
justice is long in being executed and
the party aggrieved finds no redress.
It is to go directly up to the throne
with the complaints stated in writing
and substantiated by suitable witnesses.
It is customary for the king in such
cases, to press forward the necessary
trial until the transgressor be taken
and justice executed upon him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Concerning that case which the
Newspaper reports that the prisoner
had escaped through the influence of
bribes—that is also true. The base
man Koolâp, a son of an officer in
the court of the P’râk’lang, having
forced the daughter of a plebeian
went and sold her as a slave. The
case was a long time under litigation
at M’râklawng, and was swaying from
side to side when at length it was
brought to Bangkok for trial. And
here for a long time, having balanced
one way and the other, a written com-
plaint was carried up to the throne.
The king commanded that the case be
speedily investigated. There were
certain individuals who influenced the
P’râk’lang to write a letter to the king
with the view to prevail upon him to
look upon the charges as being in
many respects false, so that the trans-
gressor might escape the severity of
the law. There was so much of error
and wrong action in this act of the P’râ-
k’lang, that the king became quite
displeased with him for it, and order-
ed the man Koolâp, together with his
father and mother, to be publicly flog-
ged, and then had Kool’âp thrust into
prison. He was in prison but a short
time, however, when he made his es-
cape. A report of this was made to
the king, when a royal command was
given to have him captured forthwith;
which being done, he was again flogged
and again imprisoned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are persons called Mâw-p’rn
(doctors of quarrels) who make a
business of instigating quarrels and
cases of litigation. They are contin-
ually entering complaints against
others, having ranges of them in their
neighbourhood. They go and pick up
little matters, which seem not to be
truthful, or they take up the quar-
rels of others not at all their own.
There are many such persons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}M’râklawng is a province more sub-
ject to cases of litigation than any
other. The king believes this to be a
true character of the place. But those
persons who continually murmur com-
plaints of it in the Newspapers with
the view of having the king take no-
tice of them, and cause them to be
investigated, shall not accomplish their
wishes. Because there is another
way to do this, a way appointed by the
king, and they will not walk in it.
That way is first to make complaint
of offences to the court of the gov-
ernors of the Province in which they
have occurred. But should the case fail of
being satisfactorily tried in the lower
courts of the Province, it can then be
carried to the sub-deputy of the place,
and then to the deputy, and then to the
governor. Should after all this, the
case fail of getting a fair trial, appeal
can be made to the royal court in{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Bangkok, or to the court of the P’râ-
klang. And then should the matter fail
of a thorough investigation, a written
statement of it can be carried up to
the throne. The person desiring this
may do it personally, or he may do it
by proxy: but let the name of the
plaintiff be appended to the complaints
rendered. This is the proper way of
procedure in all such cases. But the
practice of placarding complaints, or
casting them about, or publishing them
in the Newspapers, sometimes naming
the so called offenders and the place
of their residence is improper, and will
not meet with the approbation of the
king.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Newspapers are prone to credit
the reports of parties that have been
legally vanquished. Such parties, see-
ing that they cannot get their own
way, go and report their views of the
case in the papers. Then if they shall
seem not to have enlisted the atten-
tion of the king, they will gather up
lots of foul matter and heap it upon
their opponent and upon the place of
his residence. Now the king under-
stands this matter full well.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}White men think white men like
themselves are really men, and that
black men are not men. And although
they can become so much pleased with
black men as to say they love them, it
is all the same as when they pass up and
down on the river, and seeing monkeys,
become pleased with them, and throw
out bananas and sugar cane to to them.
They do not love them as relatives
and brethren.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}[And then having no less than four
times discribed the way to the throne
and to certain justice, a regular royal
edict is brought forward by which all
doubt is to be dissipated and all re-
remaining weakness of law made
strong. It is as follows]{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is an edict of the king on
this subject. It is this. When com-
plaints against others are flung about,
or placarded, or published in the pa-
pers of the English Doctors, such
complaints shall not be accounted as
reliable, but shall be regarded as strong
evidences against those who have them
published. Because they who do this
give palpable evidence that they are
not able to withstand their opponents
face to face, but dissemble and charge
them falsely for the purpose of mak-
ing a great noise about it. Such re-
ports are not truthful. Even if they
be, it is an improper way of procedure.
The proper way is to make such com-
plaints to the regular courts of the
land, and then, when they have failed,
to carry them up directly to the throne.
This is a way open to all, none can
forbid it. The king in great compas-
sion for his subjects has opened this
door to his presence, so that whoso-
ever will may enter it. Should the
aggrieved person, from any cause, not
be able to present himself before the
king, he may send in his complaint
by some officer of government, or by
some relative—any one may present
it. Complaints within and without the
royal harem can all find access to the
king in this way. Now since such a
way has been opened to the throne,
and certain parties refuse to take it,
and go and publish their complaints
in the Newspapers, or fling them about
the streets, or place them on the gates
of the city and temples, these acts
shall be accounted as strong evidence
against their honesty. Let them not
think that they will ever obtain the
favorable regard of the king. They
shall weary themselves in vain. Let
none who read their complaints in the
Newspapers regard them as being true.
Let all read and understand this royal
soon late.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hear that His Majesty the king
has determined to take a pleasure trip
to P'etchaburee about the last of next
month. We earnestly wish the king
could see the necessity of improving
the inland rout to that Diamond city.
He always goes in his royal yacht
steamer across the gulf, and does not
experience one of the many trials of
patience and comfort which his sub-
jects do by the inland route at Ban-
lawng, and crossing the arm of the gulf
at Maaklawng. In the former the ca-
nal is so narrow and shallow and the
crowd of boats so great that not only
common traveling boats but also boats
laden with merchandise and in great
haste to get to Bangkok are often
hindered for days. And in crossing
the arm of the gulf they are always
obliged to wait for early morning
when the sea is calm ere they dare
pass over. Hence much precious time
is lost—often twelve hours on a trip.
Now this could be avoided if there
were but eight miles of canal out from
the Maaklawng river over to the Esan
creek, and the canal thence to Bangka-
boon widened and deepened. Thus
would that very uncomfortable and
sometimes dangerous gulf be aban-
doned to those only who would prefer
to have some farther experience of
the nauseous sea.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We would beg His Majesty to con-
sider well the expediency of such an
improvement, not only for expediting
the great amount of travel and busi-
ness transacted between Bangkok and
the Diamond City, but also for having
a pleasant, direct, and safe high-way to
His Majesty's beautiful mountain pal-
ace at Petchaburee.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The accident unfortunately occurred to
her on the night of the 13th, of Feb.,
She went to sleep on her bed at upper
story of her brick house. Her few
servants went to sleep, without any
one watching her. At about 11 P. M.
she, being wakened without any noise,
rose from her bed and walked for the
door to get down from her room; but
alas! she mistook the door and opened
a window and got out, thinking it was
the door, and fell to the ground from
a height of about 10 feet, and a large
vessel full of earth for planting shrubs
or herbs placed at her window, became
disturbed by striking of her legs against
it, and falling, with her, struck her
left leg and broke the bone. She had
great pain and suffering for two days
and nights, and expired on the 16th,
inst, at the age of 81 years. The
second King of first reign had several
sons and daughters, but now only his
son and four old daughters are yet
living.{{< /news/text >}}

(Delhi Gazette.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}A MARRIAGE has lately taken place
here which caused no little astonish-
ment. A European holding a respect-
able position in one of the districts
under, the Benares Commissionership,
throwing off the garb of prejudice and
putting on the coat of unmindfulness
of the world's opinion, led to the
hymenal altar at the Ligra' church a
native female, who was formerly a Ma-
homedan. The marriage was brought
about by the kind interposition of a
Missionary of the C. M. S. who one
evening having gone out for a drive to-
wards that portion of the station where
the European was a resident, saw a
female in European costume taking out
three children for a walk; his attention
was directed towards the pretty little
children, having taken her for the ayah
in charge. To satisfy his curiosity he
and his wife called at the house of a
widow lady, a centenarian, and who
has lived in that neighbourhood for
the last seventy or eighty years; she
informed him that the female he saw
was married behind the church or in
other words; was the mistress of the
European in question, and that she
was the mother of four of his children,
the eldest, a girl, being at some school.
The next step that this good Missionary
took in the matter was to call upon the
European, and declare to him the life of
sin he was leading, and finally ended
his harangue by desiring him to unite
himself to the female in holy wedlock;
the European asked for a day's respite
to consider the momentous question
and the next waited upon the Mission-
ary and informed him that he had de-
cided in the affirmative. At this
stage of the affair some of the relatives
of the intended bridegroom interfered,
in trying to hinder the solemnization of
the marriage: to be short, all their ar-
guments having failed with their kins-
man, who was inexorable in his deter-
mination, they tried another dodge by
inducing the woman's Mahomedan hus-
band to set up an objection, but he was
also pacified by the offer of the douceur
to the extent a hundred rupees. Then
there came another hindrance, the
female was a Mahomedan this barrier
was also removed by an avowal on
her part to forsake the crescent and to
become a soldier of the Cross, and af-
ter due instruction she was baptized.
As I have before mentioned this affair
has caused no little astonishment as the
bridegroom is respectably connected;
one brother being a Deputy Commis-
sioner and another a Deputy Collector.
This marriage may be recorded as the
first one in which a European has taken
advantage of the provisions of the Con-
verts' Re-marriage Act. Shortly after
the solemnization of this marriage, an-
other European being in a similar pre-
dicament, except that he has two chil-
dren instead of four, also availed
himself of the same Act, and got
married to his mistress.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}[How could the European above
spoken of have done better than to
become united in "holy wedlock" to
"the mother of his own children" ?
If he felt sure that the children were
his own offspring and that the woman
was truly their own mother, and could
testify before God that he had no other
mistress, how could he have taken any
other course than that advised by the
"kind interposition of the Missionary
of the C. M. S."—and hope to have
an approving conscience toward his
mistress, his children, his neighbours,
or his God. Had he refused compliance
with the counsel given him, would
it not in all probability have been done
mainly for the purpose of being at
liberty to abandon the mother of
his children whenever, circumstances
might be such as to cross his pride of
caste too much to have her with him
as his mistress, and to cast off his
children upon the cold care of strang-
ers whenever it might too plainly
diminish his respectability to have it
openly appear that he was their father?
What could be more certainly a ter-
rible wrong upon ones own offspring
and their mother than such conduct?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}For all Europeans in a similar predi-
cament the path of duty and wisdom
would seem to have been clearly
opened up by the example of the
European in question. But there are
multitudes of the European race in
this Eastern world whose relations to
their mistresses are far more compli-
cated and sad. What shall they do?]{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The Paris illustrated newspapers
have given portraits of Lord Palmer-
ston, which are more or less good
likenesses, for photography had long
since made his face familiar on the
Continent. The biographical notices
attached to the engravings are frequent-
ly highly amusing. One writer ob-
serves:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The man who so often guided the
destinies of nations was a gentleman
in every sense of the word. He was
a sportsman, and a beau cavalier, always
making love, and getting into scrapes.
At all periods of life he was a most in-
veterate dancer, and would leave off
dispatch writing at any time for a
waltz. He introduced into England
la valse a deux temps. He could
talk and joke about everything, from
the rise and fall of empires to a cotil-
lion. He was gay even in a London
fog. He had little of the sadness and
gloom of the Englishmen who make
life one long story of care and work,
producing meanwhile numerous fam-
ilies which they know not what to do
with. He was fond of boxing and
hunting; in fact, an Englishman, but
not a gloomy Englishman.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}RESCUE OF THE ENGLISH GIRL ANEE
CROUCHES FROM A MAHOMEDAN
HARBM.— It is not long since we
noticed in these columns with regret,
the sale of an English girl by her pa-
rents to a licentious but aged Mahome-
dan. Since then, we learn from the
Bangalore Herald that this poor
girl has been rescued from a life worse
than death, by the gallantry of an
English soldier. As the tale savours
much of the romantic and will, pro-
bably, be read with pleasure by most,
if not all, our readers, we here reprint
what our contemporary says on the
subject.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would seem that a Sergeant of H.
M's 10th was roused into indignation,
as we all were when he heard the
shameful story; but unlike us who
could only fret and do nothing. The
Sergeant set his wits to work, deter-
mined to rescue his fair young coun-
trywoman. Being a married man him-
self, he could not exactly run away
with her, but what he could not do,
some other man might do. So rea-
soning on this hypothesis, the Ser-
geant got the girl down to his house
on the plea of spending the day with
his wife.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And as the day was being
spent, there happened the most na-
tural thing in the world to come in
on a visit, a Sergeant of H. M. 76th,
as handsome a young fellow as ever
wore a soldier's garb. Of course what
took place from this casual and ex-
traordinary meeting was to have been ex-
pected; the fair-haired girl fell in love
with the handsome young man, and
the handsome young man fell in love
with the beautiful girl. And as the
young Sergeant was no laggard in love
or dastard in war, he there and then
proposed and was accepted. A car-
riage was found near the Barracks;
into it they got, drove to church, got
hold of the Padre, who somehow or
other was not far distant, were married,
and off they now are with their Re-
giment to Bellary.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"She is wou[?] we are gone, over
bank, bush and scaur;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They'll have fleet steeds that fol-
low, quoth Young Lochinvar."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now such is our story, and will not
every Englishman exult over it ? We
vote an address of thanks to the gal-
lant Sergeant of the 10th. And as to
the disappointed mother (shall we call
her by that blessed name?) and the
still more disappointed Bahadur, they
are served right, and over their baffled
hopes we joyfully raise a hearty Eng-
lish cheer! Hurrah! Hurrah!"—Ran-
goon Gazette.{{< /news/text >}}
