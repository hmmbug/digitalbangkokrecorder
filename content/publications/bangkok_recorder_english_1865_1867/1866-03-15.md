{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the reign of P'rā-bāt Sóm-detch
P'rā-pôôt t'i-lôt-la-Nap'alie there
were three royal sons and one royal
daughter who were titled Sómdetch
P'rā-chòw-lòk-t'o'-chòwfa. The eld-
est was a son born in the year of the
rat, 8th of the decade—-civil era 1178,
christian era 1816. His name was
Chòwfa Ah P'awn. The second was
a son born in the year of the rabbit,
1st of the decade, civil era 1181,
christian era 1819. His name was
Chòwfa-Mahá-Mala. The third was
a daughter born in the year of the
great dragon, 2nd of the decade, civil
era 1182, christian era 1821. She
died on the day of her birth. The
fourth was born in the year of the
horse, 4th of the decade, civil era
1184, christian era 1822. His name
was Chòwfa-Péw.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These three Chòwfa princes, the
king P'rābāt-Sóm-detch P'rā-pôôt'i-
lôt-la náp'alie determined to honor
with the most complete dignity of the
Sókan. But before they attained to
the suitable age for receiving the Só-
kan the king deceased in the year of
the monkey 2nd of the decade, civil
era 1186, christian era 1824.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}P'rā-bāt-Sóm-detch-P'rā-NāngKlòw
succeeded to the throne.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the reign of P'rā-bāt-Sóm-detch
P'rā-Pôôt'i-lot-la náp'a-lie there were
two Sókan festivals in the palace of the
second king;-—to wit-—one for P'rāong
Chòw Pông Isăwárête, in the 4th
month of the year of the monkey, 4th
of the decade, civil era 1174, chris-
tian era 1813-—and one for P'rā-ong
Chòw-Noi Nărúmon in the 4th
month of the year of the dog, civil
era 1176, christian era 1815. On
these festival occasions there was a
display of the mount Krilat, but on a
smaller scale than that in the palace
of the first king. The ceremonies
were very similar to the Sókans for
Chòwfas. This the king granted be-
cause the two P'rāong Chôws were the
children of a mother who was the
daughter of the king of Ton-Bu-ree.
But inasmuch as the mother was not
a Chòwfa the children were not pro-
moted to that honor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This finishes all there is to be said
of the festivals of the Sókan in the
reign of P'rābāt Sóm-detch P'a-Pôôt'i
lôt-la-náp'alei.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the reign of the P'rābāt Sómdet
P'rā Nāng Klòw Chòw-yu-hua, in
the year of the dog—-8th decade
civil era 1188, and in the year of the
rat 10th of the decade civil era 1190
christian era 1826 and 1827 and 1828,
the Rajah of Weang Chan rebelled.
The country was consequently involv-
ed in war, and was not in a normal con-
dition, and the remains of Sómdetch
P'râ Amârin-t'â-ra-màtǎya remained
unburned on the throne of Dǒǒsit-mâ-
há Prasat full two years. After the fu-
neral obsequies were over, the throne
Dǒǒsit Mâhâ Prasat needed to be
repaired, which was done in the year of
the rat—-10th of the decade. At that
time Sómdetch P'râ-Chòw Nâng yat'ô
Chòwfa Ah-P'âwn arrived at the age
for receiving the Sókan. Prâbât
Sómdetch P'râ Nâng Klôw the king
spoke and said the country is still involv-
ed in war. P'râ Mâhâ Prasat must be
rebuilt, consequently there will be no place
where the Sókan ceremonies can be
held. We will, therefore, have only
an abridgment of the Sókan. Hence
preparations were made for the Sókan
at the throne Sóötei Sâwán-—the new
Prasít. But there was no mount Kri-
lat made. The processions were si-
milar to the full royal Sókan proces-
sions. On the 4th day morning there
was a procession for all the insignia
of royalty. In the afternoon there
was another procession, and this finish-
ed the festival ceremonies. This
was the kind of abridgment of the
Sókan that obtained in that reign.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the Sókan festival for Sóm-
det P'râ-chòw-Nawng-ya-t'ô Chòwfa
Mâhâ-Mala and P'râ Chòw-Nawng-ya-
t'ô Chòw Péw in the year of the
rabbit—-3rd of the decade, civil era
1193—-and the year of the small drag-
gon 6th of the decade civil era 1186
took place, there was a royal command
to have the ceremonies of the same
grade as those that were had for Sóm-
det P'râ-chôw Nawng-ya-t'ô Chòwfa
AhP'âwn and no more: consequently
the processions were the same, with
only this difference that these were
held at the throne Dǒǒsit'â Mâhâ
p'rasít.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now these three occasions of con-
ferring the honors of the Sókan gave
rise to much whispering and grumb-
ling among the people, saying that
there was no proper authority to en-
force the old custom of the Sókan,
and that therefore it was passed over
in regard to those two persons so
slightly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the palace of the 2nd king of
that reign there were three different
occasions of the Sókan festival with
royal processions for the young prin-
ces—-but they were only for P'râong
chôw—-and not for a Chòwfa. The
2nd king had a royal son by a mother
who was a princess—and bore
the name of P'râong Chòw Dara-wâdee
and was the daughter of the 2nd king
of the previous reign viz—-the reign of
Prabât Sómdet P'râ P'óöt ti yawt fa
Chǒǒlaloke. This royal son had he
been ranked according to the written
laws of the land should have been
constituted a Chòwfa. But the king
P'râbât Sómdetch P'râ Nâng-klôw did
not favor the prince with that promo-
tion. He only gave him the name
P'râong Chôw Itsâ-rap'ong. Before
this prince arrived at the age suitable
for receiving the Sókan, the 2nd
king died. When subsequently he
received the honors of the Sókan, it
was done in the place of the 1st king,
but not with the usual royal proces-
sions of a full Sókan. He was only
allowed the honors usually given to
P'râong Chòws; consequently there was
much whispering and grumbling among
the people, saying that this slackness
of following royal custom obtained
because there was no suitable author-
ity for enforcing the proper custom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}P'râbât Sóm[det]ch P'râ Nâng-Klôw
the king was pleased to adopt a
daughter of one of his sons. She was
only a Mâwm Chòw a daughter of
P'râong Chôw Lâkânanǒǒkoon who
had previously died, She was only
7 months old when the king adopted
her. He favored her greatly, even
more than any of his own children,
and gave her the name Sómânât Wât'â-
na-wâdee engraved on a gold plate
—-and granted her all the favors that
are usually granted to those who are
to become Chôwfas.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The festival ceremonies of her pro-
motion from a Mâwm Chòw to a
P'râong Chòw were very similar to
those for the promotion of the P'râong
Chôw-ying which constituted that
princess Chôwfa Kôön-t'on-t'ip'âwadee
in the reign of P'râbât Sóm[det] P'râ-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}pôôti-yawtsa Chôôla-lôke. When
P'râong-Chôw Sômânâât Wâtanawâdee
increased in years and stature until
she attained to the suitable age for
receiving the honors of Sôkan in the
year of the horse 8th of the decade,
civil era 1208, christian era 1856, the
king then gave a command to have pre-
parations made for her Sókan with
royal processions and other ceremo-
nies nearly equal to those that were
customary for a Chòwfa, with only
this difference that there was no Kri-
lât mountain. In the place of one
there was a royal stage made at the
P'râ-Mâhâ-prâsât for the bathing, and
a tabernacle for changing the dress of
the princes. With this exception the
ceremonies were the same as those
for a Chôwfa. There were royal
processions on six successive days.
But on the 7th day there was none
made for escorting the hair to the
river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now these Sôkan honors conferred
upon that princess, not to speak only
of the people but also of all the
princes male and female, the royal,
children of the king P'râbât-Sômdetch
P'râ-Nang-Klòw—all these murmur-
ed because P'râ-ong-Chòw Sômânat
Watanawadee was honored more than
any one of the children of the king.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The account of the festivals of the
Sôkans in the reign of P'râbât-Sóm-
detch-P'râ-Nang-Klòw is here ended.
The reign of P'râbât-Sômdeich-P'râ-
Nâng-Klôw ceased in the year of the
hog, 3rd of the decade, civil era 1213
—-christian era 1851. At that time
all the royal counsellors consisting of
princes nobles and lords were unanim-
ous in inviting to the throne Sômdeich
P'râ-Chôw nawng-ya-t'ô Chôwfa
Mongkut, who was accordingly enthron-
ed in the palace of the Supreme king.
Sômdetch P'râ-Chów-Nawng-ya-t'ô
Chówfa Isâwârûte-Chôôt'amânee was
at the same time invited to the throne
of the 2nd king with the usual honors
given to the 2nd king from olden
time. This was done because this
prince enjoyed high honors, and was
known and esteemed by the people
far and near as having received the
highest honors of the Sôkan accord-
ing to three examples previously
given.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After this the royal counsellors male
and female were unanimously in the
opinion that P'râong Chòw-Sômânâât-
Wât'ânââdee was a suitable personage to
become the Queen Consort of the Sup-
reme king as she enjoyed the high honors
of the Sôkan like a Chòwfa conferred
upon her in the reign of P'râbât-Sôm-
det-P'râ-Nâng-Klôw, and had a name
and honors universally known. Hence
the princes nobles and lords presented
her to His Majesty the king as his
Consort to whom was given the name
SômdetCh P'râ-Nâng-t'ô. She was
thus promoted to the highest rank in
the royal harem. She became preg-
nant and continued her gestation un-
til the 7th month, when falling sick,
she gave premature birth to a son
who was titled Sômdeich P'râ-chow-
lôôk-t'ô Chòwfa-ch'ai and was named
Chôw-Sômânâât after his royal mo-
ther. But he lived only three hours
because of his having been born so
prematurely.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sômdetch P'râ-Nâng-t'ô the Queen
Consort continued to decline fifty
days, when she expired on Sunday
morning in the year of the rat, 4th
of the decade, civil era 1214, christ-
ian era Oct. 10th 1852.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After this the royal council of
princes male and female, together with
all the nobles and lords were unanim-
ous in presenting to His Majesty the
Supreme king—the princess P'râong-
Chòw-Râm-P'ôi-P'râmâra-P'irom from
daughter of P'râ-Chòw-lôôg who
was the elder brother of the father of
the late Queen Consort, to become
Queen Consort in the place of her
cousin deceased. This princess was
from that time called Sômdetch P'râ-
Nâng-t'ô P'râong-Chòw-Râm-P'ôi-
P'râmâra-P'irom. She gave birth to
a son who was named Sômdeich-P'râ-
Chòw-lôôk-ya-t'ô Chòwfa-chôôla-long
-korn in the middle of the year of the
cow-—5th of the decade, civil era 1215,
christian era September 1853.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After this the Queen gave birth to a
daughter who was named Sômdeich
P'râ-Chòw-lôôk-t'ô Chòwfa-Chânt'â-

9th of the decade, civil era 1217,

{{< news/text >}}After this the Queen gave birth to
a son who was named Sóm-detch-lòòk

Cholera Medicine.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A new York paper gives the follow-
ing, as a recipe for the cure of the
Cholera. It is said to have proved
successful in very many instances,
during the late plague, at Constan-
tinople:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mix in a small bottle equal parts of
the tincture of opium (laudanum;)
tincture of rhubarb; tincture of capsi-
cum (red pepper;) tincture of cam-
phor; essence of pepermint—treble
strength. Add two drachms of spirits
of aromatic ammonia. Then shake
all the ingredients together, cork the
bottle, and have it ready for instant
use. It will keep for years.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dose—10 drops, 20 drops, or a
teaspoonful, mixed with a little sugar
and water; to be taken every fifteen
minutes, 30 minutes or an hour, ac-
cording to the severity of the attack
and the age of the sufferer.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This compound is pronounced by
medical men one of the most judicious
ever prepared for popular use, but at
the same time it must be borne in
mind that it is a medicine which
should be used delicately, although
no one can be harmed by it if they
follow the above directions. A few
doses generally relieves the patient.
Children require only half the quantity
used for grown people."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
How to Prevent Cholera.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among the measures best calculated
to arrest the spread of the epidemic,
the most energetic and effectual are
those intended to bring about a puri-
fication of the air, and the production
of ozone or electricized oxygen.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Three things have been observed,
viz:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That populous cities or quarters in
those cities, which are badly ventilat-
ed, or where the inhabitants are dense-
ly concentrated and packed together,
offer a sure and easy prey to the
Cholera:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That the Cholera disappears usually
after a storm.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The inference to be drawn from
these facts is that the pure and health-
ful air which we breathe in the coun-
try, is due to the presence of the gas
which some call ozone, and others,
electrified oxygen. In cities, the at-
mosphere absorbed and vitiated by
thousands of breaths, cannot, and does
not contain ozone, especially in the
narrow streets, which are always the
most densely peopled. During a storm,
the electric fluid which disengages,
spreads abroad through the whole at-
mosphere; ozone is produced; the air
is purified; the causes of unhealthful-
ness disappear, and with them their
innvitable consequence, the Cholera.
The production of ozone, then, is the
thing to be chiefly thought of in places
threatened with the Cholera, and the
means effecting this are at once cheap
and simple.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The apparatus is well known: a
battery of four or five elements decom-
poses acidulated water, with an ad-
dition of one tenth of its bulk in sul-
phuric acid. The hydrogen of the
water goes to the negative pole, and
when thus obtained, the gas is thor-
oughly ozonized. It is only necessary
then, to distribute quantities of it
through the air, with a battery in
every house and in every street, if
needs be. We shall then see the
dreaded pestilence checked and neu-
tralized.—-Boston Med. Journal.{{< /news/text >}}

ABROGATION OF EXTRADITON TREATY.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following are the precise words
in which the Moniteur announces the
abrogation of the extradition treaty
between France and England already
reported by telegraph.—"As is well
known, extradition matters between
France and England are regulated by
the convention of the 13th of Febru-
ary, 1843, which stipulates the reci-
procal surrender of criminals taking
refuge in one country from the other,
and accused of assassination, murder,
forgery, or fraudulent bankruptcy.
An experience of more than twenty
years having demonstrated the ineffi-
ciency of this treaty, the Emperor's
Government has resolved to terminate
it. His Majesty's ambassador in Lon-
don accordingly made known on the
4th of December to the Queen's
Government that the Emperor's Gov-
ernment, in virtue of the faculty stip-
ulated in Article 4 of the Convention
of the 13th of February, 1843, would
consider the treaty as being no longer
in operation at the expiration of the
six months following this declara-
tion,"{{< /news/text >}}

European mail have much less in praise
of President Johnson's plan of recon-
struction than formerly. They dis-
close a vast amount and variety of
evidence proving but too conclusively
that a great majority of the leading
men at the South are far from being
willingly submissive to the amended
constitution which constitutes all the
negroes their fellow citizens, and as
such equally entitled with themselves
to "life, liberty and the pursuits of hap-
piness." It were no wonder that they
should have still flowing in their veins
somewhat of the taint of slavery, by
which they have so long loved to lord
it over the black men and make them-
selves nabobs by their unrequited la-
bor. And it would be a miracle of moral
transformation if after even many years
of experience with the negroes as their
neighbors and fellow citizens, however
orderly the latter might behave,
that they should then find them-
selves in every respect willing that
the despised race should enjoy equal
chances with themselves in the race
of manhood. But the President and
his sympathizers at the North, in his
plan of hastening the Southern States
back into power in Congress, have
been taken, it would seem, quite aback
by the late startling developments a-
mong men in power at the South.
Though the long proposed amendment
of the Constitution to kill slavery
legally throughout all the U. S.
by ratification of three fourths of all
the States of the Union, became an es-
tablished law on the 18th of Dec.
yet the States which were first to re-
bel for the sake of the perpetuation
of slavery to the end of time, are now
evincing boldly the same spirit by
their winking at the continued oppres-
sion of the freedmen in their midst,
and by the new laws they have framed
and are framing for the purpose of
preventing their elevation in the com-
mon and divine scale of humanity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The President, in view of such dis-
closures, with a true magnanimity
akin to that of the illustrious Lin-
coln, appears to have modified very
considerably his views of the expe-
diency of his plan of reconstruction,
and to be willing to submit it quietly
to the discision of Congress whether
it shall be continued or abandoned.
He evinces, if we mistake not, the best
republicanism by a ruling desire to
obey the sovereign people who have
placed him at the helm of state one
brief watch of her glorious career. He
has most honestly thought that the
people were pleased to have him pur-
sue the course he has. And now
since their Majesties have sent their
representatives to Congress to do their
bidding, the President is going to hear
and obey their voice, and steer the
ship of state according to their dicta-
tion, without any undue exercise of
the veto power. Such, at least, is
our opinion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The present Congress is composed
of the most loyal, stable, and wise men
the whole people could select, and the
question of reconstruction, as well as
the one of negro suffrage which is the
great one for discussion by that body,
we may, under God, safely entrust to
their decision.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}One of these justices whipped his
own negro not long since. A plan-
ter this last week knocked a negro
with a paddle with which blow he lay
senseless for two days and when the
Yankee who had bought the planta-
tion went out to employ the hands
he could not get at them, but
learned afterward that the reason was
that he had threatened to shoot them
if they told the fact to this Yankee,
who brings the story. At the office
of the Bureau in Mobile, I learned that
thirty-eight black men had been killed
in that district, of six counties, within
three months. And who ever heard
of any single man being hung for these
murders?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the last sabbath of November, the
same record shows the following report
of crime as against black persons in and
near Mobile. Dr. Hall struck "Delia"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}several times with a whip, and then
complained of her for larceny, to a-
void complaint against himself; and
the court sent her to thirty days of
hard labor. James O’Neal cut open
the head of Jo. Howard whith an ax,
in the presence of the crew and passed
on board. James Sweney tried to cut
the throat of John Hazle, who was a-
sleep, and failing of that, cut him o-
ver the forehead and stabbed him in
the eye. Mc Danies with a shot gun,
shot at Henry Bolings, on his way to
church because, when cursed for going
through an alley, he replied, "This is a
wrong highway." George W. Davis tried to
kill Starr with stones and brickbats,
and left his head in a jelly. Henry
Downs beat the boys P. Gould, N.
Gould, and Jessy Ripley, on their
way to church. Sibly, Stark, and
Watkins shot and killed Alfred Bufford
and another negro, and wounded Puff-
er, because they would not submit to
be tied up, when there was no civil
process in the case.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In Choctaw County, Ala, not long
since, a company of black people were
waiting at the landing to go down the
river. They saw Bil Odam coming; all
ran into the woods but a woman and
her children, who though sex and in-
nocence would protect them.-—“Where
are you going? Down the river, din’t
you, to the-—Yankees!” “Yes sir.”
“I’ll show you the way though hell.”
He drew his bowie-knife, cut her throat,
that of the girl, nine years old, that of
the boy seven, then threw the dead
bodies into the river, and the live ba-
by after them. On the Tombigbee a
woman and two children were nailed
into a hen coop and thrown into the
river. At Claiborn, on the river, be-
low the city, six or seven negroes
were killed at different times. Three
negroes were sleeping in a corn crib,
Planter Dudley came up in early mor-
ning, called them out, shot two with a
double-barelled gun, and another man
shot at the third, who escaped, and
before the superintendent of freed-
men testified that he saw Dudley kill
them; and yet, when turned over to
the civil court, he was cleared, and has
now run away, and the military are
trying to re-arrest him. Four miles
from Claiborn a father, a mother, a
daughter of seventeen, a boy, and a ba-
by, which was the child of the mur-
derer, were all killed by farmer, Sal-
lie, as he was taking them back home
after they had tried to get to the Yan-
kees. Three or four of the ex-slaves
who came to the Bureau to complain
were his own children. Four compa-
nies of coloured troops were at Bladen
Springs—-abused by white citizens,
who promised to do better if troops
were removed. Troops recalled but
Lieut. Slick left behind sick, with a
black guard. Meeting of citizens held;
word sent to the Lieutenant to leave
in five days; he did so. The same
meeting also resolved to notify all
white and black persons who had be-
friended the colored troops to leave
in five days; five white families did
leave, and many blacks, and two old
black men were shot. Do you wish

Correspondence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
To the Editor of the Bangkok
Recorder.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir.—-We lukewarm foreigners can
hardly appreciate the degree of feel-
ing and earnestness which like lumin
ous golden threads run through the
pages of one of your late Editorials,
linking itself with a material far richer
than even gold or silver, hiring human
sympathies with an enslaved and op-
pressed people, in whose cause hamper-
ed, as we know you are, you still
bravely struggle on. It is left to those
who during their long residence have
quired a correct knowledge of the
Siamese, to mark the elevating influ-
ences that so rapidly follow in the
wake of the "Siamese Recorder." And
it is not our intention, to tell you all
that in the stillness of the world with-
out, and our souls within we have
thought and felt on this subject. It
is enough for us to say that we are of
the least of those who believe that the
"Recorder" has the right stuff in it
for success. A paper so evidently
genuine, honest, and courageous in its
tone, evincing outwardly the sign of
a generous, frank, and kindly guiding
spirit within, can hardly fail to be
successful in the end. And moreover
we are of opinion that the obstacles
that may be thrown in its way, ei-
ther from within or without, will be
converted into fresh material for more
and more striking success. There is
scarcely an old 'head' amongst us
who is not conscious that these res-
trictions and crampings are in reality
a good and not a bad fortune to the
Siamese "Recorder," if it but pos-
sesses itself in patience. Success is not
attainable "per saltum" a hop-step-
and a jump, but by singleness of
purpose and arduous, energetic, ever
increasing, and never flinching perseve-
rance. It is the brave resolution to
do what is right and true and good,
in spite of obstacles and restriction,
that lays the substrata of all real
greatness. Is there a true knight
amongst us who does not on his very
knees thank God for the restrictions,
obstacles and difficulties, that gave
fresh vigor to his pulses, new inspi-
rations to his thoughts, deeper and
more vital stimulus to his exertions and
led him on from step to step, till he
reached the haven of his hopes? Conse-
quently we are assured that all who
are interested in the social progress
of this country, will agree that a
'Paper' which works in a double ca-
pacity as does the "Recorder" for the
rich as well as for the poor, for the
oppressed as well as for the peoples,
for the king as well as for the peoples
even though it may be the means of
revealing an infinity of unwholesome
practices and every species of abuse,
under a systematic rule of squeezing,
robberies, and slave makings the most
unsightly and loathsome to contem-
plate, should not only meet with grateful
acknowledgement, but encouragement,
and support from the Siamese govern-
ment, if it is a "goverment" at all in
any sense of the word, and not be forbid-
den to the people as it now appears to be.
Indeed there must be something ra-
dically wrong and pitiable in the state
of things that reveals an infectious
fear, and goes a shivering about, prohibit-
ing access to that which common sense
owns to be one of the most universal
and popular of means adopted for in-
fusing that wide reaching sympathy,
which, by bringing the ruler into closer
contact with the sorrows, joys and
suffering of the people, calls forth the
magnanimity and greatness of the one,
and the strength and confidence of
the other.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So great a work requires propor-
tionate agents and means, great men,
great thoughts, and great acts; and
alas! how are these to be had, but
by a liberal policy, and freedom of
speech through the press? The ruler
of any people ought to identify his
interests with that of his subjects.
And how is he to understand the va-
rious phases of the social well doing
of his subjects without such contrib-
utary information, that a free press
has the means of eliciting and which
enables all the most despised and in-
jured to seek his protection; and if he
condescend but to touch the spring, it
will raise at once the lid, and lay a world
of untold and unheard of oppression
at his feet. Surely from what we
know of the present king we have
a right to believe that he would be
the last to forbid such access to him-
self; for one day, on the grounds front-
ing the palace, we saw him gather to-
gether with his own hands, and read
over the complaints and petitions of
a host of poor half naked wretches.
Mentally we have had our hats off
ever since, at the thought or memory
of this fact: but alas! he little knows
all the exceptional cases of cruelty
which must necessarily result from a
system where so much power is lodged
in one class of men, and the other per-
mitted only a nominal protection from
the law: nor does he know that even
when the royal command is issued for
redress to some hapless wretch, his ma-
gistrates and Koon San and other
corrupt administrators trample them
under foot, and instead of redressing
the wrongs of the unhappy plaintiff,
they rob him in the shape of "bribes"
of his world's goods, and send him
back to a wretched and now poverty
stricken home the poorer for having
had faith in the honor of a "court
of equity" under the flag of the
white elephant; and thus losing faith
in goodness and truth, he the aggressed
becomes the aggressor and commences
to practice on others that which had
first been perpetrated on himself.
Justice is indeed a "bye word" in this
land. The most prominent feature on
which the policy of the rulers and admin-
istrators revolves itself, may be con-
densed into these emphatic words! "Un-
to him that hath is given, and from him
that hath not is taken even that which
he had."—An enigma to be solved
only when these fat, slothful, effemi-
nate, and corrupt Koon San and others
are brought to know the "magic" of
a sovereigns displeasure.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Every one knows, and knows well,
that a Siamese court of judicature is
a sphere in which any bold unscru-
pulous bad man is pretty sure of real-
ising a fortune in a year or two, and
that the mal-administration of justice
in any land does more than any thing
else to demoralize the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What shall we then say of the fu-
ture of a people already steeped to
the very lips in injustice, cruelty and
oppression. Every kindly heart waits
and wonders that justice should slum-
ber in its way, from such a king as
we believe the king of Siam to be, to
such provocations as these,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The king whose true policy is be-
lieved to be "gradual advance," must
deal with these facts and not with
sentiments and traditional customs.
Surely he knows that it is wiser to
open up and bring to light these abu-
ses and corruptions, and thereby weed
the growing evil out of his country,
than to wait till they grow too strong
for him, and that to forbid to his
subjects free access to him as their
head through a channel so legitimate
as the press, is a wrong morally, a
mistake politically, and that it will
lead to misfortune and abuse practi-
cally: besides it will nullify his great
name abroad, his influence at home,
and in the end snap to the roots the
loving faith with which his own sub-
jects regard him at present.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let him but pursue his wonted
course with his mind clearly alive to
the advantages of a "free press" and
ever on the alert to punish and put
down every instance of injustice and
oppression that is thus brought under
his notice, and never let him in the
present irritation (that the knowledge of
such "wrong" must cause him) lose
sight of the true and only lasting
greatness that must ever be associated
with liberality, justice, mercy, truth,
and in particular with the name of one
so wise, sagacious, and just as he him-
self undoubtedly is.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
To the Editor of the "Bangkok
Recorder"
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir,—A few days ago I was very
much grieved to hear from a friend
that the "currently reported" article
in your issue of the 1st inst. with
reference to mutilated photographs re-
ferred to me, and what is worse, that
many believed it true.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I therefore consider it a duty I owe
Mr. Thomson (who has left his nega-
tives in my care) to refute your
statement as far as it concerns me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I admit that one day I amused my
children and self by collecting some
damaged or condemned photographs
out of the waste paper basket and
grouped them together in the most
comical manner imaginable, and that
when done I thoughtlessly allowed a
friend to see them, they were then
destroyed. I did nothing maliciously
nor did I think for a moment that
what I had done would be miscon-
strued or magnified into the proportion
it has been, and my friend not per-
ceiving what mischief might accrue
from it, if it came to the ears of cer-
tain individuals who are not over par-
ticular as to the truth of their state-
ments, mentioned what he had seen to
some of his friends, who again retailed
it with sundry additions until "a
mountain was made out of a mole hill,"
and it reached your paper. Some wags
took up the report and "for a lark"
told some of their sensitive friends
they had been caricatured; and one
gentleman very naturally asked me
if it was true; I told him it was not.
But to satisfy any who may be in
doubt, allow me here to state, that I
have never for any dishonorable or
malicious motive mutilated or other-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}wise made use of any person's photo-
graph. I have never used a negative
for that purpose neither have I sent
or even given away a caricatured
photograph of any description except
my own which I sent to a friend. I
may also state that I was the first
person to tell the parties whose pho-
tographs I had used of what I had
done. They laughed heartily about it,
and did not think an apology neces-
sary. But one or two evil disposed
persons have considered it their espe-
cial duty to fan the flame thus ignit-
ed and add fuel to the fire for my es-
pecial benefit. I am sorry their talents
and energy have not been put to a
better and more useful purpose.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is scarcely an individual,
saint or sinner in this city but what I
have heard some "currently reported"
scandal about, therefore "he who is
without fault let him cast the first
stone." I hope should the next "cur-
rently reported" article refer to me,
your correspondent will sign his name
to it.{{< /news/text >}}

Ladies and their Long Tails.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Crinoline at length is going, thank
goodness! but long, trailing dresses
are coming in, thank badness! In mat-
ters of costume, lovely woman rarely
ceases to make herself a nuisance and
the length of her skirt now is al-
most as annoying, as a while ago, its
width was. Robes & queues they call
these dragggling dresses; but it is not
at Kew merely that people are tor-
mented by them. Every where you
walk, your footsteps are impeded by
the ladies, who, in Pope's prose,
"drag their slow length along" the
pathway just in front of you. "Will
anybody tread upon the tail of my
petticoat!" This seems to be the gen-
eral invitation they now give. Sad
enemies to progress they are in their
long dresses and a Reform bill should
be passed to make them hold their
tails up. Ladies should be taught to
to mind their p's and queues; and
every policeman should be armed
with a big pair of garden shears or
tailor's scissors wherewith to cut away
the skirts which he sees trailing on
the pavement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Young ladies, as a rule, we will allow,
are little ducks; but by wearing such
tails they make geese of themselves.
Clearly something must be done to
shorten their appendages, if it only be
on account of the public. We often
see a child tripped up by a long dress,
and falling on what Jaques calls it
"innocent nose" thereby. If the
trains be worn much longer, there is
no telling what mis-haps and master-
haps may be occasioned by them.
Well nigh as many accidents will be
met with by these troids as by those
upon our railways, and we really hardly
know which of the two may prove
more dangerous. For ourselves, hav-
ing the welfare of our little ones at
heart, we always try to tread upon
many dresses as we can, and to do
them all the damage that hobnailed
boots can perpetrate. If every father
of a family would sternly do the same,
the fashion of long dresses would have
a short existence.—Punch{{< /news/text >}}

that Russia has notified to Prussia,

Had Russia made this intimation a

ill-feeling and useless outlay, and en-
abled Prussia to retreat with better
grace from an untenable position. But
it is well she should interpose at last,
especially as there is reason to believe
that she has really done so effectually.

the English newspapers are to be

the confirmation of this statement be-

COTTON IN INDIA.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}THERE is a rumour of good news
from America—the best for India we
have heard since the blockade. The
able London Correspondent of the
Bombay Gazette states that it has
been proposed in Congress to levy a
duty of 10 cents or 5d., a pound on
the export of American cotton. It is
true that this has not been proposed
or, so far as yet appears, approved of
by Mr McCulloch, the cautious Secre-
tary to the Treasury. But the fact
that it should be made at all gives us
hope that there may be a duty of at
least 8d. a pound. For Mr. McCul-
loch has left the whole question of
new or more taxation to a Commission
whose report is soon expected. Five-
pence a pound would yield twenty
millions sterling, or two-thirds of the
interest on the Debt, when the export
rises to two millions of bales. It would
force the Southern States to bear the
chief share of the burden they have
caused. And as, by devoting forty
millions a year steadily for the Debt,
Mr. McCulloch hopes to extinguish it
in twenty years, and the only other ex-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}port staple of the South is sugar, no-
thing is more probable than that he
will adopt a proposal so fruitful in it,
results, so popular in the loyal States
and abstractly so just as a temporary
measure. It seems more and more
certain that for two years more India
will draw her forty millions a year
for cotton, and for twenty or thirty
after that be allowed by an American

London Letter.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
London, January 10.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The two great sources of anxiety
at present, in England may be said to
be the Rinderpest and the state of the
money market. The former still con-
tinues to spread with a degree of ra-
pidity which has filled the nation with
alarm. Last week the number of vic-
tims amounted to 7500, an increase of
1500 over the return of the previous
week. Every attempt to discover the
nature or the cure of the disease has
been unavailing, and modern science
with all its vaunted progress, stands
aghast at this new visitation, which
baffles all our skill. It is now proposed
at once to interdict the movement of
cattle throughout the country in the
hope of stopping the progress of the
contagion, but so many cases have
been found of cattle attacked by the
murrain when in a state of complete
isolation, that there are serious doubts
of the successful issue of an experi-
ment which cannot fail to inflict great
distress on the country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The money market is in the most
ticklish state. The Bank has raised
its rates to 8 per cent., but it is doubt-
ful whether this will be sufficient to
check the demand for accomodation.
In addition to the large loans required
for the continental kingdoms, and the
large speculations into which the
greed of gain has plunged the nations,
there has been a vast trade with Ame-
rica since the termination of the war.
Tempted by the high price of every
article, owing chiefly to an inflated
currency, people have been sending
over goods, for which there has been
no equivalent return to specie and
produce. A large debt is due from
America to England, and the ship-
pers are constrained to resort to the
capitalists for loans. In addition to the
usual discussion in the city article of
the Times, there is an elaborate leader
on the subject, which wears an omin-
ous aspect. To-day they are talking
of a panic, and if it once breaks out,
there is no knowing when it will stop.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the Continent, there are signs of
the waning of Count Bismark's power,
and of the determination of Aurtris
and Russia to resist his attempts to
make Schleswig and Holstein Prussian,
and there is a certainty that the Prus-
sian Parliament, when it meets, will
exhibit the most virulent hostility to
him.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
FRANCE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This year the prospect is cheering,
as far as the authority which is en-
throned in Paris is concerned. Ever
since the New Year's Day of 1859
and its significant utterances to the
Austrian Minister the Continental
Powers have been prepared to arm at a
word from the Tuileries. Austria,
Prussia, Italy, the Papacy have listen-
ed with emotions of hope or fear. This
year there has been nothing but speech
of happy augury for peace, addressed
to the Papal Nuncio as the represent-
ative of foreign diplomacy. The Em-
peror speaks of strengthening the bonds
which unite nations and kings, and
hopes for a long day of peace and
prosperity for the world. There have
been periods when these might be
thought words of course, but the situa-
tion of affairs is such that we may really
hope they represent the convictions of
the Emperor and the French nation.
As to the latter, every year gives fresh
evidence that there's no popular desire
for war. France, like England, has
attained to all the honour which a na-
tion can fairly desire. As England,
with an immense empire and a com-
merce which encircles the globe, loves
peace because the most successful and
triumphant war could give her nothing,
so France, victorious over the most
formidable armies of the Continent, and
with her intellectual and artistic suprem-
acy even more assured than her
political power, does not care to enter
on new campaigns which can add no
glory to the conquerors of the Malak-
hoff and Solferino. The contented
ambition of the two leading European
nations is an important guarantee for
the peace of the world. We may say,
also, that if France is satisfied, the
Sovereign who rules France has reason
to be satisfied also. All the latest
achievements, both foreign and dom-
estic, of the country are his own, and
if great deeds can establish a throne
his ought to be secure. Hence the
world has learnt without surprise that
the Emperor will withdraw from the
two enterprises which still detain a
portion of the French army in foreign
lands. The long occupation of Rome
will be brought to an end during the
present year, and the future govern-
ment of what remains of the Papal
States will be left to the arbitrate-
ments of its own people.—-Friend of
India.{{< /news/text >}}

First Thoughts.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In worldly matters 'think twice,'
but in duty, it has been well said, 'first
thoughts are best;' they are more fresh,
more pure, have more of God in them.
There is nothing like the first glance
that we get at duty, before there has
been any special pleading of our affec-
tions or inclinations. Duty is seldom
uncertain at first. It is only after we
have involved ourselves in the mazes
and sophistries of wishing that things
were otherwise than they are, that it
seems indistinct. Considering a duty
is often explaining it away. Delibera-
tion is often only dishonesty. God's
guidance is plain where we are true.{{< /news/text >}}

Eating Dirt.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Nation has an intelligent and
keen sighted correspondent traveling
through the South who reports the fol-
lowing remarks from an old planter he
found near Fayetsville, N. C. Proba-
bly it indicates pretty fairly the senti-
ment of very many Southerners:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“There’s a good many trying to
make out that they’ve always been
sound Union men, when the fact is we
were all rebels together. I am in favor
of acknowledging we’re whipped and
asking forgiveness, and then if the
United States won’t take us back, why
its not our fault. We’ve got to eat dirt
anyhow, as Vance says, but blamed if
I think much of a man that pretends
he likes it. I never could keep up
with the politicians, though.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}THE FRENCH COMMERCIAL MARINE
IN CHINA.-—According to the terms of
a convention recently concluded be-
tween the Chinese Government and
M. Berthemy, the French Plenipoten-
tiary in China, the voyages of French
trading vessels between China, Japan,
and Cochin-China will hereafter be
considered in respect of the payment
of tonnage dues as simple coasting
voyages. Consequently all vessels
bearing the French flag will be allow-
ed to trade between the ports of those
countries without being called upon
to pay tonnage dues oftener than once
in four months, whatever may have
been the number of voyages they may
have made. This measure is also ap-
plicable to French vessels trading be-
tween one Chinese port and another
without touching at any foreign port,
and also to junks and other vessels
employed by French merchants in
coasting operations which hitherto
have been exempt from all tonnage
dues under the 22d article of the
treaty of Tientsin.—-Moniteur.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}MR. SAMUEL SMITH.—Who has vi-
sited India in his Circular issued at
the beginning of the year seems to us
to come to very fair conclusions on
the subject of cotton supply. In 1865
all the world sent to England 2,755,
000 bales of which 1,267,000, or about
a half, were from India, 462,000 from
America, 340,000 from Brazil, 334,
000 from Egypt, and the rest from
the West Indies, China, and the Levant.
By doubling the American supply
for 1866, reducing the East Indian to
1,235,000 and the Egyptian to 234,
000, increasing Brazil to 450,000 and
striking out China, he expects 3,000,
000 bales in the current year, and the
quality of the whole will be superior.
Perhaps the supply expected from
America is too large, considering the
disorganization of capital and labour
in the South, and the demands of the
North. But this amount will be suf-
ficient to supply the mills of England
and Europe, while keeping up the
price of the manufactured goods for
at least all this year.{{< /news/text >}}
