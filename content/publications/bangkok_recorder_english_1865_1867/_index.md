The 1865-67 English language editions of the Bangkok Recorder are very different from the earlier 1844-45 printings:

* **Content and Focus:** The 1844-45 edition had a more academic and general knowledge focus, with articles on science, philology, and fables, but it contained very little information about Siam itself. The 1865-67 English edition is a true news journal, with a heavy emphasis on local life and current events. It includes editorials commenting on recent events and detailed chronicles of local happenings.

* **Tone and Editorial Freedom:** The earlier edition is extremely cautious and reserved, avoiding local political subjects due to the Siamese government's policy of isolation and a general distrust of foreigners. The later English edition adopts a bold and independent tone, with opinions expressed freely and even criticizing high-ranking officials and foreign diplomats. This newfound freedom was a direct result of the political transformation under King Mongkut. However, the strong opinions expressed ultimately led to Bradley being sentenced for defamation against French Consul Aubaret and fined $100 in the American Consular Court.

* **Purpose:** The original publication's conveyed "useful information" to the Siamese people, while the later English edition was a full-fledged news periodical covering politics, literature, science, and commerce. This shift in purpose also changed its format from a monthly publication to a bi-weekly (and later weekly) journal.

**Reader's Notes**

* The text is reproduced as faithfully as possible including archaic spellings, a few typos and some unusual typesetting. 
* Text lines are reproduced as per the original newspaper with line breaks, hyphenation etc maintained.
* A commonly used archaic expression relates to dates:
  * "inst" refers to the current month, e.g. _on the 15th inst._ means 15th of this month. 
  * "ult" refers to last month, e.g. _on the 15th ult._ means 15th of last month.
* A small number of words are illegible in the source material and are instead represented with [...] in the online version.
