Dr. Kitto;
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
OR
THE REMARKABLE WORKHOUSE BOY.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is very sad to think of the many re-
spectable families who are brought to ruin
by intemperance, and the number of in-
nocent victims who suffer every kind of
misery from the effects of that vice. I am
about to relate a most affecting history of
the life of a great man, who died only four
years ago; and whose home in childhood
was desolated by the bad habits of his
mother and father, of the subject of my
narrative, were reduced to poverty through
the love of strong drink.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mrs. Cecilia Picken was a very respec-
table intelligent woman, living in 1796, at
the pleasant village of Brixton, near Ply-
mouth. Her husband was a man in a good
trade, as a bootmaker. They had one little
girl named Mary; three sons by Mrs. Pic-
ken's former husband were all grown-up
and settled at a distance from their mother
and stepfather. One stormy night, when
Picken had been on some matter of business
to Plymouth, he was prevailed on by foolish
friends, to partake freely of strong drink
—and being generally a very moderate
man, perhaps he drank without being fully
aware of the effects of the liquor. He
mounted his horse to ride home to Brixton,
but alas! when about halfway on his road,
probably overcome with either dizziness or
sleep, he fell heavily from his horse, and
died instantly. If any thing could add to
the widow's grief at this sad termination
of her husband's life, it was that she ex-
pected another infant in a few weeks. The
poor little babe, fatherless before its birth,
came to add to the mother's cares. It was
a girl, and they named her Elizabeth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The widow was not a woman to sit down
and nurse her sorrow—she felt it a duty to
her two helpless little girls, to struggle
with her grief, she was industrious and
much respected by her neighbours, by
whom she was generally called "THE MIS-
TRESS." By dint of great exertions she
managed to bring up her daughters well—
but as they grew towards womanhood, in
the hope of improving her circumstances,
the widow removed to Plymouth. In the
same street where she took up her abode,
two young men, brothers, came to reside.
The elder, William, was an engineer; the
younger, John, a stone mason—and both
were intelligent young men in good cir-
cumstances. These two brothers formed
an attachment for the two sisters, Mary and
Elizabeth, and it would have been well if
a few more years had passed over the heads
of these young people before they had
thought of marrying. But trade was good,
and all seemed fair-weather prospects. The
sisters were both very pleasing, but very
different. Mary was tall, high-spirited,
with a rather imperious manner. Eliza-
beth though plainer than her sister, was
more agreeable, from her greater gentle-
ness. In 1803, the marriage of John with
the younger sister took place, the bride
was scarcely eighteen, and the bridegroom
only twenty. There was only one dark
cloud hovering over their otherwise clear
prospect—both the brothers joined freely
in the use of strong drink. Being clever
young men their company was prized, and
when William, who married Mary, began,
as well as his brother, to neglect his home
of an evening, it was the commencement
of bad days. On December 4th, 1804, a
child was born to John and Elizabeth—in
whom they gave the father's Christian
name—a delicate child, destined in after
years to many trials, and to many triumphs.
His sorrows in his father's house, began
soon—for by the time that John the son
was four years old, John the father had
injured his circumstances and his good
name by intemperance. At this period,
the grandmother, Mrs. Picken, pitying the
little delicate boy, took him to her home,
as her special charge—and for a few years
he had a happy childhood. Unable and
seemingly unwilling to join in the rough
play of other children of his age, the boy
was a delighte-l listener to his grandmoth-
er's budget of stories, and early began to
read for himself all the entertaining books
that could be bought or borrowed for him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There was one disadvantage arising from
John being brought up in his grandmoth-
er's home—his parents being relieved of
their responsibilities, evidently thought
more of their younger children, and John,
when he occasionally came to their home,
seemed more like a visitor, than a child of
the household. At that time, the boy did
not feel, perhaps, did not observe this.
Happy in the tender love and care of his
good grandmother, his affectionate heart
most gratefully returned her love. But the
course of intemperance is like a fire, it
consumes all before it; and the home of
the once happy couple was the scene of
want and strife, and to add to the misery,
Mrs. Picken had sold all her little property
to assist her family, and was now in her
old age attacked with illness that made it
needful she should reside with her daughter
Elizabeth; so that when John was ten
years old, he became with his sick grand-
mother, dependent on his parents. The
father was now merely a journeyman
mason, and often out of employment. He
did not try to keep his little thoughtful boy
at school, and indeed, John had very little
schooling, having only attended for a few
months at a time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The mother was so reduced, that she had
to go out charing to earn a trifle for her
family, and the father sometime took John
to help him in his trade, and when Saturday
night came, would send home the poor
boy without a farthing, while he spent his
wages in the alehouse. One day a house
in Batter street, Plymouth, was being re-
paired—and John then in his thirteenth
year, and small of his age, was carrying up
a load of slates to the roof, he had just
reached the topmost round, and was step-
ping off the ladder on to the roof, when his
foot slipped, and he fell five and thirty
feet on to the stone pavement of the back-
yard of the house. The poor boy was lifted
up insensible, bleeding from his mouth
and nostrils, BUT NOT FROM HIS EARS.
He lay for a fortnight in a stupor, and then
consciousness returned. The first thing he
noticed, was the total silence of the room,
and he thought that all were keeping so
still, out of a kind concern for his weak-
ness, but yet he wondered why no one
spoke to him; at last he was strong enough
to say, "Why do you not speak?" To his
amazement, a reply was written on a
slate, and handed to him, the words were,
"YOU ARE DEAF." Yes! this was the
meaning of all the dumb-show he had ob-
served! Never more was he to hear a sound!
The full force of his great grief was not
felt all at once by the poor boy; for four
months that he was conlined to bed, the
silence conduced to his recovery; and in
four months after that, eight months in
all, his health was partially restored, but
he was afflicted for life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He now found the advantage of being
able to read, and he improved himself in
writing, so much so, that he tried to earn
a trifle by writing labels neatly. The kind-
ness of neighbours supplied him with books
but not of a very useful sort; and his efforts,
many and ingenious as they were, all failed
in enabling him to get even a scanty liveli-
hood. To add to his sorrow, his dear,
kind grandmother, the only earthly friend
who really loved him, was obliged to re-
move to Brixton. Helpless herself, she
could not help him, except by her prayers,
and they were constant. Yes! readers,
and though she did not live to see it, they
were answered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So poor deaf John was now dependent
entirely on his parents; and they evidently
feeling impatient of the burden, made
application to the parish, and the guardians
agreed to receive him. November 15th,
1819, he was placed among the boys in
the workhouse. A cruel device was em-
ployed to get the unsuspecting youth there.
He was taken to the workhouse in ignorance
that there was any intention of leaving
him there, and when the doors were closed
upon him, "his anguish was indescribable."
How hardening is the effect of intemper-
ance—here was this boy's father, a skilful
mechanic, not more than thirty-six years
old, and yet he put his eldest son, a good stu-
dious youth, who had received the injury
that afflicted him, by doing work for his
father beyond his age and strength—he put
him in the workhouse, apparently glad to
get rid of him—and even the mother made
no resistance. Bowed down by sorrows,
she seemed spirit-broken. There is seldom
a night so dark that no ray of light appears,
and God put it into the heart of the gover-
nor of the workhouse to be kind to poor
John, and the clerk to the Board of Guar-
dians, Mr. Burnard, soon discovered that
this was a wonderful workhouse boy, and
a friendship was commenced that lasted
for life.{{< /news/text >}}

United States.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Despatches from all parts of the coun-
try represent the people as generally
endorsing the President's veto and speech,
and numerous delegations have visited
the President to offer him their support.
The Senate has adopted the resolution
of the Reconstruction Committee, exclu-
ding the Southern representatives until
Congress declares the rebellious states to
be entitled to representation, by 29 a-
gainst 18 votes. The Military Committee
of the House of Representatives have re-
ported a resolution to disband the South-
ern militia, to prevent their reorganiza-
tion. At a Fenian meeting held in Wash-
ington on the 28th Feb., intimations were
given of a plan to seize British Columbia,
and establish a harbour for privateers on
the Pacific coast. The British Minister
is understood to have forwarded a com-
munication to the State Department on
the subject, which formed a topic for dis-
cussion at a Cabinet meeting. A pro-
clamation will probably be issued by the
Government against any violation of the
neutrality laws. The public debt was, on
the 1st March, $2,820,000,000 being an
increase of three and a-half millions since
the 1st February. Gold, on the evening
of the 3rd March, 131. Exchange on
London, 145. Cotton steady; middling
upland, 44c.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lloyd Garrison has delivered a public
discourse violently denouncing President
Johnson, and charging him with intend-
ing, if he dared, to make a COUP D'ETAT,
either by forcing the rebels into Con-
gress at the point of the bayonet, or by
driving the Congress out of the Capitol.
The President, he said ought to be tried
by both houses, and dismissed from of-
fice. The Republican caucus have ap-
pointed a committee to inaugurate deter-
mined political measures against Presi-
dent Johnson's policy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is reported that Fenian representa-
tives are in Washington pressing their
claims upon the United States Govern-
ment for the recognition of Ireland as a
belligerent power. They claim that the
nullification of all constitutional law by
the establishment of martial law in Ire-
land entitles the Irish forces to the rights
of belligerents. Sir Frederick Bruce is
said to have protested against any such
application being entertained. The sus-
pension of the Habeas Corpus Act in
Ireland caused intense sensation in Fenian
circles. Meetings were called through-
out the country to determine their course
of action. Upon receipt of the intelli-
gence, Mahoney immediately issued a
circular from the military department,
urging the people to be prepared for im-
mediate action, and look out for secret
orders.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Southern advices disclose nothing of
importance of a political character. The
planters were making preparations for
the spring planting, and were generally
hopeful of being able to contract for
labor enough to secure average crops.
The agents of the Freedmen’s Bureau
are said to be very unpopular with the
people, who have frequent disputes with
them, all of which, however, are generally
adjusted by the military authorities to the
satisfaction of both parties. No cases of
violence are reported.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The constitutional amendment exclud-
ing negroes from the basis of represent-
ation in all States where they are not
allowed to vote, was considered in the
Senate. Three substitutes, conferring
the right of suffrage upon negroes, were
offered, but rejected. A vote was final-
ly taken on the original amendment, and
the result was 25 yeas to 22 nays. The
amendment, failing to receive the required
two-thirds vote, was declared defeated.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Recruiting for the Mexican Republic is
reported to be progressing at New Or-
leans. According to intelligence from
Vera Cruz, it was asserted that Maxi-
milian had authorized the issue of 20
million of dollars in legal tender currency.
It is reported, via San Francisco, that
the imperial commander at Sonora had
seized freight trains belonging to Ameri-
can citizens, and prohibited further tran-
sportation through Sonora by Americans.
Advices received in New York from
Panama state that the Spanish commo-
dore, Nunez, had proposed an armistice
to Chili, stipulating, however, for the
return of the captured vessel the Gova-
donga and the Spanish prisoners, and
the appointment of peace commissioners.
These propositions were refused by Chili;
and Nunez then proposed that the Chilian
Minister for Foreign Affairs should go on
board the Spanish flagship, in order to
make some arrangement. In reply to
this the Chilian government informed
Nunez that any proposition he had had
to make would be received at the Chilian
capital.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The President describes the Freedmen’s
Bureau Bill as unconstitutional and unne-
cessary, and as proposing to establish by
Congressional authority military jurisdic-
tion over all parts of the United States
containing refugee freedmen. The measure,
he says, would lead to arbitrary acts by
government officials, would abolish trial
by jury, which is guaranteed by the Con-
stitution, and would make the Freedmen’s
Bureau, established as an extraordinary
military measure, a permanent institution
with enlarged powers. It is, moreover, in-
consistent with a time of peace. The Con-
stitution never contemplated Congres-
sional legislation for the support of indi-
gent persons of any race. Legislation im-
plying that negroes are not self-sustaining
would tend to injure their character and
prosperity. The President animadverts
upon the fact, that the 11 States mainly af-
fected by the bill are shut off from repre-
sentation by Congress, and says that the
principle is firmly fixed in the minds of
the American people that there shall be no
taxation without representation. Congress
can decide the qualifications of its mem-
bers, but every State should be allowed re-
presentation in the persons of loyal repre-
sentatives. He fully adheres to his recon-
struction policy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}General Grant has directed all comman-
ders of military to send to headquarters
copies of newspapers expressing disloyalty
and hostility to the government. The sup-
pression of papers will be made from head-
quarters.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A densely-thronged meeting was held
on February 22nd at the Cooper Institute,
New York, where all classes of politics
were represented. An address and reso-
lutions were adopted urging the admission
of loyal Southern representatives to Con-
gress, approving the veto, endorsing Mr.
Johnson’s policy, and recommending the
calling of another meeting whenever the
exigency demanded it, to promote har-
mony in the public councils of the country.
Mr. Seward made a speech, in which he
said that the country was in no peril, no
matter whether the Congressional or the
Presidential policy prevailed. This con-
fidence arose from the conviction that
there never was, and never can be, any
successful process for the restoration of
union and harmony among the States, ex-
cept that with which the President show-
ed himself satisfied. Loyal men from the
Southern States would, sooner or later,
during this or some other Congressional
term, be received into the National Legis-
lature. The restoration would then be
complete. Territorial government would
require greater imperial powers than Napo-
leon possesses. Maximilian's task, though
he engages two emperors and two imperial
organizations, with their forces, was not
thought the most wise or hopeful political
enterprise of the day. The Congressional
policy was impracticable and vicious.-—Mr.
Seward telegraphed from Washington as
follows:—-“It is all right. The Union is
restored. The country is safe. The Pre-
sident's speech is triumphant, and the
country will be happy.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Times’ New York correspondent
thinks the President will be upbraided [?] by the
nation. He “has not yet heard, on any
subject, so strong, decided, and unanimous
an expression of the public sentiment as
upon his act.”:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is most fully and warmly approved;
all classes express their satisfaction that
there is a man at the head of public affairs
who has determination and self-reliance
enough to throw himself against a power-
ful and overbearing party; they are ap-
prehensive of the consequences of con-
tinued disunion in the country, and they
fear that the evils and disasters of the war
will be repeated in another form if the
policy of Mr. Sumner and his followers is
to prevail.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The astonishment and anger of the Radi-
cals, he adds, are extreme, and some of
them are making threats of impeachment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}George Frances Train, of eminent no-
toriety in England as well as America, has
gone in for Fenianism.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the house of Representatives, on
the 12th ult., the anniversary of Mr.
Lincoln’s birthday, Mr. George Ban-
croft, the historian delivered a eulogi-
um upon the life and character of A-
braham Lincoln, on which occasion
President Johnson, the members of
the cabinet and of Congress, the Di-
plomatic Corps, and the army and the
navy officials were present. In his
address Mr. Bancroft censured the
course adopted by England during the
Rebellion, and declared that the Mex-
ican republic must rise again. It
seems to have been a foolish speech.
He succeeded, the Washington corres-
pondent of the Times says, “in making
the whole affair as undignified and dis-
creditable as any man in the country
could have done, tried he ever so hard.
To the astonishment of every respecta-
ble man in the House, Mr. Bancroft
occupied more than two hours in an
elaborate attack upon the chief Powers
of Europe, concentrating the whole
torrent of his bitterness and spleen up-
on England. The surprise of the
whole Diplomatic body at the energy
and vehemence of Mr. Bancroft’s de-
nunciations of England—for he almost
screamed out the venomous passage in a
high and broken voice, and with
wild gestures and distorted counte-
nance—was extreme, and it was fully
shared by many of the spectators.
The bulk of the audience clapped
their hands loudly with applause; but
the Senators, almost to a man, sat si-
lent.” Mr. Bancroft’s speech has, we
are told, given great offence to the
Diplomatic Circle at Washington.{{< /news/text >}}

Jamaica.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dates are to the 24th Feb. The Royal
Commission had been sitting from day to
day and receiving evidence—the testi-
mony of the whites and negroes being very
contradictory. All the political prisoners
tried by the special commission have been
found guilty and sentenced to imprison-
ment, varying from three weeks to twelve
months, the latter sentence being passed
on Mr. Levien, editor of the COUNTRY
UNION. A charge of murder had been
preferred against Provost Marshal Ram-
say; but it is expected that the Act of
Indemnity will shield him from any pen-
alty. The Royal Commission hoped to
have concluded by the 10th March, and
to leave Jamaica on the 24th. Mr. Eyre
continued to receive addresses of sym-
pathy and approval.{{< /news/text >}}

Or, COOKING WITHOUT FIRE
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In New Zealand there are numerous
boiling springs. Travelers and mis-
sionaries frequently look at these springs
whilst their native guides superintend
the boiling of the food for their wel-
come repast. Villages of the natives
are to be found near these volcanic
springs. They are rather dangerous
localities for a home, but the natives
prefer them as they thereby require no
fires, and all their cooking being done
in the hot springs, the women's back

over, from the warmth of the ground
they are able to raise crops several
weeks earlier than their neighbours.
Sad accidents, however, sometimes
arise from children and strangers fall-
ing into these boiling caldrons.{{< /news/text >}}

A Resume.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our last European mail, by the
steamer Chou Phya, and the sailing
vessel Edward Marquard, bringing us
European papers down to the 26th of
March, American papers to the 6th of
Feb. and telegrams from London to
the 15th alto.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The political elements of the Wes-
tern world are far from being "hush-
ed to peace." The portentous cloud
that had been hanging over Ireland
many months, seems to have been
somewhat broken but not dissipated.
It remains to be seen whether the
suspension of the "Habeas Corpus
Act" will impart adequate power
to quench, not to say "all the
fiery darts" of the rebels, but all that
are the most dangerous to the peace
of the common wealth. We fervent-
ly hope and expect that we shall soon
hear such good news, but must confess
that we are not without many fears
that the incipient rebellion will yet
terribly shake our mother country and
convulse the world.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prussia and Austria are still exceed-
ingly watchful of each other, lest the
bone of contention between them,
having much meat on it, shall be
monopolized by one or the other na-
tion. "Prussia insists upon having
and annexing to her dominions the
Duchy of Schleswig and Lauenburg.
Austria declines being thus overborne."
The two powers have been standing
in the attitude of menace toward each
other many months. Prussia flattering
herself that Austria would by long
pressure yield the point from a con-
sciousness of her own comparative
weakness, seems at last to have been
"takenaback" by the determination of
her rival to face steadily and unflin-
ching the lion with all the eyes and
strength of her empire. Though
Bismark the Prussian prime leader
seems undaunted in playing his game
for the premiership of all the German
States, the king of Prussia, it would
seem, has become alarmed and has
come to a significant halt. He even
seems to have made up his mind, that
a war with Austria must be avoided.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}France is quiet at home and gene-
rally abroad. She manifestly feels much
perplexed with the Mexican question,
and wishes that she had never placed
so much confidence in the mere hu-
man prophecies of the permanent dis-
rupture of the U. S. which but too
successfully tempted her to go strange-
ly out of her way to force the esta-
blishment of a Monarchy on a weak
Republic, when that Republic could
not call in her neighbor the U. States
to aid her in resistance. While France
is too proud to feel happy in the
thought of withdrawing her troops
from the aid of Maximillian as insisted
upon by the U. S. it is now almost uni-
versally believed that she has determin-
ed to do it rather than to run the risk
of the consequences of resistance of
so righteous a demand.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The political atmosphere in the
U. S. is of an equally character. The
rebellion in the South though conquer-
ed, seems to be but smothered up in
the hearts of the majority of the pres-
ent leaders. Mighty efforts are being
made by them to regain their former
power in Congress. Nearly all the
North who sympathized with them in
their rebellion, are now using their
influence to get them restored, even
with the embers burning in their bo-
soms against the yankees and against
the freedom of the African race, of
whose unrequited services the U. S.
Government has deprived them. These
men form a powerful political party in
array against the Republican party.
The latter have set their faces like a
flint to have the Southern States shut
out from representation in Congress un-
til they give better evidence than they
now do of being truly loyal, and are
determined that the Freedmen shall
have strict justice dispensed to them
according to their inherent right to it
and the pledges the Government of the
U. S. have made them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are greatly pained to learn that
on questions of this character Congress
and the President had come to a dead-
lock. Still we hope and trust the
President in vetoing the "Freedman's
Bureau Bill" has acted in all faithful-
ness to the Constitution, and that he
sincerely intends to abide by it accor-
ding to the best of his judgement, aid-
ed by its best expositors, which,
if done, will in good time, we doubt
not, result in a solid and lasting peace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a great pity the President
lost his characteristic patience and com-
mand of dignified and temperate lan-
guage in much of his speech on the
22nd of Feb. To charge such men as
THE HON. CHARLES SUMNER of being
"equally opposed to the fundamental
principles of the United States' gov-
ernment, and as much laboring to
pervert or destroy them as were those
who fought against the government"
in the great Rebellion, was to say the
least of it an outrageous thrust, and
will in our opinion do the author of it
far more damage than the men or the
party at which it was hurled. Such out
bursts of denunciation "are evil and
only evil" even among political stump
speakers in the middle walks of life,
but the evil is exceedingly intensified
and made vastly more wide spreading
when coming from the lips of one so
highly exalted as the President of the
U. S. Am. The best hearts of the na-
tion have been pierced by those dag-
gers, and are bleeding to this day.
Still we hope they are wounds that
may be healed and that the author of
them, in noble penitence, will not be
slow to do what he can to heal them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are glad to notice that Messrs.
Stearns and Sumner bore the thrust
with remarkable forbearance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following extracts from the N.
Y. Independent will give our readers
some idea how the Radical Republi-
cans feel in regard to the present cri-
sis of political affairs in the U. S. We
confess that we sympathize deeply
with those radicals, believing that
they do indeed lay the axe at the
root of the accursed tree, slavery,
though we could wish they had more
of the patience and gentleness of Christ
in their noble efforts to extirpate eve-
ry remaining root of African oppres-
sion. We firmly believe they are
working in the line of Jehovah's pur-
poses to give the oppressed race all
the fullness of liberty the white man
has, and that God will uphold them
and their cause with the right hand of
his righteousness.{{< /news/text >}}

The Present Crisis.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The blush which the President
brought to the cheek of the Nation on
Washington's Birthday has had time
to fade into cooler blood. Men have
permitted their sudden indignation to
wane into settled regret. It is hardly
possible to realize the sacredness of
national honor until it is confronted
with the calamity of a national dis-
grace. Our enemies familiarized
this nation with the pang of grief. Our
Chief Magistrate has twice pierced
it with the sting of shame. God
shield the Republic!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not proven is the charge that the
President was in liquor. On the con-
trary, his friends esteemed him in his
right mind. But perhaps the superi-
ority of the office enables a president to
be as vulgar when sober as a vice-presi-
dent when drunk. With unheated blood,
then, the Executive of the United
States publicly brands the National
Legislators as Traitors. Borrowing
language from the French Revolution,
he calls the Joint Committee of the Fif-
teen "An Irresponsible Directory."
Pointing to the Capital where Congress
sits, he exclaims, "Almost another
REBELLION is inaugurated!" The
acts of one of the three great co-ordin-
ate departments of the Government
he describes as the "Progress of Fac-
tion, Rebellion, and TREASON."
With ominous emphasis he warns a-
gainst "Cliques, Cabals, Conspira-
cies, and Machinations." Descend-
ing to the pit of billingsgate, he
named two American statesmen, one
a leader of the Senate and the other
of the House, whom he calls as "much
the enemies of the Government as
were Jefferson Davis, Slidell, and
Toombs." The Clerk of the United
States Senate, the official medium of
communication between that body and
the Executive Mansion, he styles
a "dead duck." These gentlemen, and
others acting with them in Congress,
he stigmatizes as "opposed to the funda-
mental principles of this government,
and laboring to DESTROY it." Not
content with this extraordinary lan-
guage, he adds the astounding decla-
ration, "I make use of a very strong
expression when I say that I have no
doubt the intention was to incite AS-
SASSINATION." Then, as if in
view of the expected accomplishment
of his own murder, he prescribes the
manner of sacrifice, directing that an
altar be reared, his body laid there upon,
and his blood poured out!{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}And all this foulness to come out of
the mouth, not of Andrew Johnson,
but of the President of the United
States! All this miracle of scandal to
go flying round the world to sadden
all nations with the shame of the great-
est!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A few hours after this speech by the
President, his Secretary of State spoke
its counterpart at Cooper Institute,
New York. "When Mr. Seward rose
last night," said the next day's Eve-
ning Post, "he did not know how
greatly the President had just offen-
ded." But Mr. Seward did know
how greatly the President had just
offended." A morning journal, an or-
gan of the Government, says:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Three or four dispatches were sent
to Mr. Seward stating that the speech
of Mr. Johnson was a frightful one,
a speech that he could not endorse,
and begging him not to speak at Coop-
er Institute." {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of these warnings was sent by a
U. S. senator, and and the other by a
Cabinet minister! But Mr. Seward was
not afraid of a thing frightful. He
made his speech that night; he peru-
sed the President's next morning; he
gave thanks for that immortal objur-
gation; and he forwarded the following
congratulation by telegraph to Wash-
ington.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
NEW YORK, Feb. 23, 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is all right and safe. The Un-
ion is restored and the country safe.
The President's speech is TRIUM-
PHANT, and the country will be hap-
py.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Signed) W. H. Seward.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus Mr. Seward shares the guilt
of his master, re-enacts and intensifies
the Executive insult to Congress, and
announces to an astounded nation that
the President's Cabinet Minister for
Foreign Affairs is happy to regard the
Senate's Chairman of Foreign Rela-
tions as a Traitor, Conspirator, and
Assassin!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the President has planted a
thorn in the pillow of his ablest advo-
cate. The Evening Post—whose re-
vered editor lent to the scroll of the
Cooper Institute meeting its most eui-
nent name—administered to the Pres-
ident the faithful rebuke of a friend in
the following righteous words:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"For the shocking and unseemly im-
putation Mr. Johnson chose to bring
against Messrs. Stevens, Sumner, and
others opposed to his policy, that 'their
intention was to incite assassination,' 
we trust that he will make haste to
APOLOGIZE, not merely to them,
but to the country, which he has most
grievously INSULTED." {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now, of what stuff and grain was the
President's meeting? It was the
meeting of Copperheads. Among
the invited guests was not a single Re-
publican. Previous to the President's
harangue, the chief speaker was the
Hon. S. S. Cox! The resolutions con-
tained the following reminiscence of
Rufus Choate and the glittering gene-
ralities:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}} "Resolved, That the grand old dec-
laration that "all men are created equal"
was never intended by its authors, nor
understood by the people for whom
it was made, as placing the African
race in this country on a civil, social,
or a political level with the Cauca-
sian. • • • While we are willing to
accord to those exotic and unassimi-
lable fellow-creatures all the privile-
ges necessary to their personal well-
being we will never consent to imperil
the sacred inheritance derived from
our Revolutionary fathers by entrust-
it partly to the guardianship of those
who know not its value and who care
not for its preservation." {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So the Declaration of Independence
was not intended for "All Men." On
the contrary, some who are rashly
thought to be included in it are Exotic
and Unassimilable Creatures: a theory
which we do not understand except as
illustrated by the President's Exotic
and Unassimilable Speech. At this
meeting Clay Smith said: "I would
separate the black man from the white,
and put the black in one country, and
the white in another." The Hon. A.
J. Rogers, from New Jersey, added:
 "When one of the objects of the war was
to shake off the shackles of the slaves,
and rob the people of the South of
millions of dollars of property, I pro-
tested against it." [Applause]. The
Hon R. T. Merrick exclaimed, "Rally
all you that love your country, and aid
your chief magistrate in crushing be-
neath his heel that disguised enemy
of the Union, Thaddeus Stevens, and
his nest of poisonous serpents that
crawl and hiss around the pillars of
the republic." The Hon. Myer Strouse
shouted, "Clear out the miserable
stable!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such was the talk, such the assem-
bly, such the accessories, and such the
President who stood as centre-piece !
Paint not the historic scene, lest a fu-
ture generation mistake it for the pic-
ture of Gov. Seymour addressing his
"friends."{{< /news/text >}}

For the Bangkok Recorder.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The Change.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is abundant reason to believe
that Siam to-day is quite different
from Siam thirty, twenty, fifteen, or
even ten years ago. The Siamese
themselves may not readily perceive
it, as most of their customs are still
held to with wonderful tenacity. In-
deed they are a people of customs.
Perhaps no other nation holds so
tenaciously to custom as this one.
That it is the Tumncum Thai is
sufficient reason for doing anything
how absurd soever it may be, or how
easily soever it might be abandoned.
They are like the story told of the
country man, who went to mill re-
peatedly with a small quantity of
grain in one end of the bag, and a
stone in the other, and then threw
it over the back of a horse. The miller
told him it would be much better to
throw away the stone, and divide the
grain into two parts, but his only re-
ply was that it was the way his father
did. All great changes however have
not been sudden but gradual, and
notwithstanding their tenacity for
custom, there is an almost impercepti-
ble change going on here. In this
respect the Siamese are perhaps an
improvement upon their Celestial
brethren. Whilst the Chinese are in
many respects superior to the Siam-
ese, and have much more stamina of
character, still in their own estimation
they know all that is worth knowing
already, and are slow to receive any
instruction from their "red haired"
brethren, the Europeans. The Siam-
ese on the contrary are more willing
to adopt any thing European which
pleases them but are at the same time
slow to acknowledge their indebted-
ness. But how loth soever they may
be to acknowledge it, there is no
doubt that they are much indebted
to their intercourse with the subjects
of western powers for the improve-
ments we find amongst them to-day.
Previous to the present reign that in-
tercourse was limited. Missionaries,
it is true, had been here for years, and
here also as in most other places,
were the pioneers who prepared the
way for a more general intercourse.
A few others also had ventured here
for the purpose of trade, but as yet
comparatively unprotected by any
treaty. The exclusive policy, however,
of the former kings was abandoned,
when a Prince was brought to the
throne who was much more highly
instructed than any of his predecessors,
and consequently was imbued with
more liberal views. The country was
consequently thrown open to commerce
by treaties with the principal western
powers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But whilst the government and the
principal government officers are be-
lieved to be friendly to foreign inter-
course, there is still, undoubtedly, a
strong party opposed to it, and would
rejoice to see every foreigner out of
the country to-day. It may be asked,
therefore, in what way foreign inter-
course has specially benefitted the
Siamese? The laboring classes have
been much benefitted by it. It has
opened up to them a new and varied
source of employment, which hitherto
did not exist, and they are thus ena-
bled to secure a much better liveli-
hood than before. The services of
quite a number are required by the
European community, for which they
receive much better wages than the
same class of persons could command
any where else. The way thus open-
ing to them, of new places of labor
has a tendency to create in them a
stimulus for labor. They need very
much such stimulus. They are na-
turally lazy and dilatory. Their real
wants are comparatively few, and
if they have rice for the day, a little
kap, and a salung for gambling, they
are perfectly happy so far as this
world is concerned. Most of them,
too, being slaves, have no desire
to labor lest the fruits of their labors,
fall into the hands of their masters.
Many of them, however, avail them-
selves of any new opening in order to
get a little change to meet passing
wants, and many have actually bought
their freedom. Such persons are,
therefore better fed and clothed than
formerly. A few years ago a jacket
was a very rare thing among any class
of the natives, but now any cooly can
support a good one if he desires it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The better classes also enjoy the
advantage of being able to do a little
pigeon on their own account. In
this they sometimes get the worst of
it, but they again in turn are often-
times the successful ones. So upon
the whole they are like Paddy and
the log when rolling down the hill to-
gether, each party is on "top half the
time." They have also learned much
of European customs. Some have
also obtained some knowledge of
European architecture, and are build-
ing houses in a kind of Siamo Euro-
pean style, and furnishing them with
European furniture. They have also
been benefitted by a knowledge of the
power of steam, and its uses as a pro-
peller, and also of different kinds of
machinery. As a result of this know-
ledge they have about thirty steamers,
one of which is the much extolled "Im-
pregnable." Many of these steamers, it
is true are mere pleasure boats, or
play things, but they show that the
Siamese have not been idle in this
matter. There is reason however to
fear that they will outstrip their in-
structors in their own estimation. Not
long since a European wished to
charter a steamer from a Siamese no-
bleman, for the purpose of towing
and lightering, but the nobleman re-
fused to charter. It was thrown out
as an inducement, that she needed new
boilers and he would thus get her re-
paired. He replied that he was ex-
pecting boilers from her, but if they
did not come the Siamese could make
them. When pupils thus excel their
teachers, there is no further need of
the latter. But in some of these
things we cannot blame them if they
proceed with caution, they have
been taught some severe lessons. They
sometimes dread as a "burnt child
dreads the fire."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Their mercantile marine is also an
evidence that they have been advan-
cing in the art of ship building. But
a few years ago the river at a certain
season of the year was lumbered up
with unsightly Junks, whose huge
cables were stretched in every direc-
tion and obstructing every thing pass-
ing by. Now a Junk of the largest
size is rarely seen, and in their stead
we find riding at anchor in the river
a number of fine vessels, of excellent
models, bearing the Siamese colours.
Some say that in this respect they
have gone too far, and have more ves-
sels to-day than are useful or profit-
able to them, but this of course time
only will prove.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to the real pecuniary advantages
accruing to the government from the
treaties we of course can only approx-
imate, as we have not the necessary
statistics. But take the single matter
of rice, since the removal the prohibi-
tion. Suppose that each of the mills
in the last four months has cleaned
90,000 piculs. This amount at four
ticals export duty per coyan, will
bring quite a little sum into the ro-
yal treasury. Paddy too has com-
manded the highest prices and it has
been impossible to get it down. For
this the merchants are perhaps them-
selves to blame. They manifested
too great anxiety to have the prohibi-
tion removed, and the consequence
was they had a lot of ships on their
hands, before there was really any
thing to put in them, and paddy could
not avoid remaining high. The sale
of so much paddy, too, and at such
prices must have sent afloat among
the rice growing regions, a great
amount of money, much of which will
return into the hands of the princes
and nobles. This also creates an in-
ducement to cultivate the fields and
waste lands throughout the kingdom
which will of course result beneficial-
ly to all around.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Consuls.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}SIR :—The article you published in
your issue of the 26th. ult. relating to
Consuls, has been most timely and to
the purpose so far as it goes. There
is another aspect of the subject which
in the present state of things ought to
be brought out. The Siamese Gov-
ernment has I think, been treated
with great disrespect little short of, if
not with, open insult by the French
Consul. As this Consul is expected
to return to his post ere long, the
question now is, what is the duty of
the Siamese Government in the pre-
mises? The Siamese officials seem to
hesitate what to do, fearing the result.
This is wrong. The following ex-
tract from Whenton's International
Law answers the above question very
clearly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Consuls are not public ministers.
Whatever protection they may be en-
titled to in the discharge of their offi-
cial duties, and whatever special pri-
vileges may be conferred upon them
by the local laws and usages, or by
international compact, they are not
entitled by the general laws of nations,
to the peculiar immunities of ambas-
sadors. No state is bound to permit
the residence of foreign consuls unless
it has stipulated by convention to re-
ceive them. They are to be approv-
ed and admitted by the local sovereign,
and if guilty of illegal or improper
conduct are liable to have the exequa-
tur, which is granted them, withdrawn,
and may be punished by the laws of
the State where they reside, or sent
back to their own country, at the dis-
cretion of the government which they
have offended."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let the Siamese government act
without the least fear or hesitation,
and if the officials are honest in their
convictions, carry out at once the re-
medy which the Law of Nations pro-
vides. All enlightened nations will
approve and commend an act based
on the above extract, and as France
acknowledges the authority of Inter-
national Law she cannot take excep-
tions to it. The object of law is to
protect the weak and correct wrong.
The fact that France is great and
strong, and Siam is small and weak,
does not justify the French Consul in
affronting or encroaching on the Siam-
ese, nor does it excuse the Siamese
because they are comparatively weak,
from resisting and applying legal re-
medies to correct "illegal or impro-
per conduct." {{< news/indent4 >}} Lux.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The President has revoked the ex-
equator of Dr. Rogers as Chilian con-
sul at New-York{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The treaty relations of Siam with
Europe and America is constantly
bringing the Siamese government into
new and perplexing difficulties. These
difficulties are likely to increase rath-
er than diminish, and it becomes the
duty of the Sovereign and Ministers
to provide themselves with every pos-
sible facility to enlighten and qualify
themselves, to meet every emergency
and adjust it speedily and properly.
The great want of the Siamese gov-
ernment at the present moment is a
translation of the Law of Nations.
Fortunately there are persons in
Bangkok qualified for the task whose
services can be procured. The work
of Phillmore can probably be trans-
lated for one thousand dollars per vol-
ume, and that of Wheaton in one vol-
ume, for two thousand five hundred
or three thousand dollars. Either of
these works well translated would be
worth to the sovereign and ministers
of Siam a hundred times it cost, and
they cannot make a more judicious
expenditure than to hire one or both
of these works to be translated.{{< /news/text >}}

Siamese Consuls.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It appears that the Siamese govern-
ment has appointed Consuls to re-
side in London, Paris, Vienne, Lisbon,
Rangoon, Penang, Singapore, Hong-
kong and other places, but has no
Consular Law to define their duties,
regulate their proceedings, designate
their authority and power, nor any
thing whatever to guide, restrict, pun-
ish or do any thing with or
through them in a legal way. Their
consular affairs are all haphazard and
chaotic. This state of things ill com-
ports with the reputed statesmanship
of His Majesty and the Prime Minis-
ter. Conducting state affairs in this
manner is like a person attempting to
establish himself as a merchant
without capital, rules, or regulations.
The Siamese government may go on
for a time with apparent success with-
out the necessary laws; but days of
disaster will come, and if they have
no law to fall back upon, the dishonor
which must follow will be very great.
Possibly there may be some excuse
for the past, but the Siamese govern-
ment cannot be excusable for neglec-
ting to provide the necessary laws
without delay.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}To the Editor of the "Bangkok Recorder."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir,-—Your correspondent who signs
himself "one of the victims" of a late
dinner party, appears annoyed at the
arrangements made for so many guests,
but he did not (because he could not)
point out any thing which was badly
arranged. From his very grammat-
ically written letter I imagine the
conceited fellow expected to be plac-
ed at the head of the table, or at least
among the Consuls. In my opinion his
proper place would have been behind
one of the chairs. As it was, the poor
"victim" of a good dinner, ought to
think himself highly honored that he
was allowed a chair anywhere at a ta-
ble where there were LADIES and
GENTLEMEN.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Perhaps "Victim" had prepared a
speech for the occasion, and had not
an opportunity of delivering it. I am
truly sorry if such was the case, as
from the style of his letter I am sure
it would have been very interesting,
and would no doubt have put the com-
pany into that "good mood" HE ALONE
found wanting. Some say your cor-
respondent was not there at all, but
was one of those who framed a refu-
sal to the EXPECTED invitation, but who,
not having received any, was saved the
trouble of declining. I am going
to ask a friend to dine with me to-
morrow, should the side dishes not
be properly seasoned I shall expect to
see it mentioned in your next week's
issue. {{< news/indent4 >}} Your's respectfully,{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Mr. EDITOR.-—In a small corner of
your model paper, oblige me with space
to put the following question, which
many beside myself would like an-
swered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Has a British subject a right to a
written copy of any legal proceedings
taken by or against himself in H. B.
M’s. Consulate on payment of an au-
thorized fee for the same?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Hearing that several persons have
been refused such, and reading another
case of the kind in your last issue,
and laboring under the impression
that we are entitled to such if requir-
ed, and there being no constituted law-
yer in this place to set one right in
the matter, I resort to this method to
gain the information.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}While in a scribbling humor I will
take the opportunity of contradicting
an erroneous statement made in your
last concerning the British Government
organs, the Habeas Corpus Act, and
Prest. Lincoln.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I beg to state that the said “Organs”
played no such tune, and with the ex-
ception of one or two of our pen-
ny trumpeters, the music though on
different keys, was played on your
own Instruments, in your own Oches-
tras, and with but slight variations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The “Times” and that best of all
weekly’s, the “Examiner,” said “that
such a mandate was not exactly the
thing they should have expected from
a Representative Republican Gov-
ernment.” like that of America, but
that it showed that Prest. Lincoln
thought matters more serious than did
Mr. Seward, who, if you remember,
Mr. Editor, was to have the rebellion
of the South put down in 90 days.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The suspension of the Habeas Cor-
pus Act in Ireland, is for a very differ-
ent purpose than that intended by
Prest. Lincoln, and a very short time
will show us the kind of animal it
will cause to be placed in the hands
of our genuine loyal Irish police. It
will empower them to take charge and
keep in safe custody those many
Irish black-guards, and cosmopolitan
rowdys, now prowling about Ireland
in the uniform of American soldiers,
and claiming to be American subjects.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Woe betide poor Patrick Casey—-
late of Tipperary (and still later)
Capt. Casey of the U. S. Army—-na-
turalized American, when proved Re-
negade and conspirator, his doom will
be sure and speedy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The suspension of the Habeas Cor-
pus Act in Ireland, to use an Ameri-
canism, will be “a caution to snakes”
Excuse me Mr. Ed. I feel myself warm-
ing upon the subject, but I cannot
help (whenever occasion offers) giv-
ing expression to the extreme con-
tempt I feel towards those white-wash-
ed fellows, who are now endeavoring
to delude, rob, and bring into trouble
the poor and ignorant among our loy-
al Irish brethren.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I mean nothing offensive to any
true American. I admire them and
many of their institutions, and with
Macauly can say “that I look with
pride on that young and vigorous
people, within whose veins flow the
same blood as ours, whose minds are
nurtured by the same literature as ours,
and on whom is entailed the rich in-
heritance of our religion, our freedom
and our glory." {{< news/indent4 >}} I am,{{< /news/text >}}

Answer to "A. Briton."
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}We return thanks to our respected
friend "A. Briton" for his prompt reply
to our statement touching the suspen-
sion of the Habeas Corpus Act by
Prest. Lincoln and the British Govern-
ment. When we first read it in Ms.
we thought it quite possible our
impressions concerning that matter
had been incorrect by having, some
how or other, been jumbled together
with the Alabama & Shenandoah de-
monstrations against the U. S. But
on further thought and re-search we
think that our impressions were in all
probability quite correct. We find
in the New York Evening Post of
March 6th 1866, an extract corrobora-
tive of our views taken from one of the
British "organs," and one of great pow-
er, whose notes were heard during all
the period of the late Great Rebel-
lion with great pleasure throughout
all the British dominions "on which
the sun never sets" and even in Bang-
kok. We have not time now to rum-
mage old files of English "organs,"
and think it unnecessary since the
London Times sounded so loudly,
clearly and continuously, and since its
notes were in such harmony with
those American "organs" who de-
nounced Prest. Lincoln's procedure of
suspending the Habeas Corpus Act.
The London Times in speaking of the
"Dis-United States" of America and
prophecying of the certain downfall
of the "Great American Republic"
used the following unmistakable and
strong language against Lincoln's act.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"At home no man's life, or liberty, or
"property is secure; for how can life
"or liberty be secure in a country
"where the habeas corpus act is sus-
"pended indefinitely, where citizens
"have no redress against unlawful im-
"prisonment, and no available means
"of obtaining a public trial; and how
"can property be secure when money
"is no longer a thing of intrinsic value,
"and when confiscation and taxation
"are becoming words of similar mean-
"ing? This is the happy Union which
"the Americans are now making for
"themselves, and to which they expect
"that, when it is completed, all man-
"kind will flock. They have but to
"add to it, as they are now doing, the
"abnegation of all the comforts of
"civilized life, they will soon have to
"negotiate a Fugitive Slave law with
"their neighbors to keep their own
"subjects within their pale."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We should be glad to have it pro-
ven that the suspension of the "Ha-
beas Corpus Act" in Ireland "is for a
very different purpose than that in-
tended by Prest. Lincoln," that there
has been no rebellion brewing among
British subjects in Ireland, that all
the terrible bluster made there has
been made only by "those many Irish
blackguards and Cosmopolitan rowdies
claiming to be American subjects."
But our impression is that England
herself has had great fears that Ire-
land would be soon all ablaze in re-
bellion if she did not speedily adopt
the extreme measure she has. We
admit that there is some difference
between the two cases-—the one hoping
by a suspension to arrest a rebellion
in awful progress-—the other to destroy
a rebellion in embryo. Being thus
contrasted, we beg to ask which go-
vernment would seem to be the least
open to criticism? We find fault with
neither. With all our hearts we praise
England for her prompt measure to
destroy the Irish rebellion in embryo.
For all the world knows without the
shadow of a doubt what the progeny
would be should it come to the birth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hope some English jurist will
answer "A. Briton's" important ques-
tion. Being Americans we feel our-
selves just now incompetent. We can
only say that if it had been put to us
in regard to the American consulate, we
should answered it in the affirmative.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Mr. Editor.—-I have just received
a Photographic likeness of His Majes-
ty the king of Siam said to have been
executed by a nephew of the king. As
a work of art the picture will compare
favorably with those taken by other
artists, and is the best likeness of His
Majesty I have yet seen. This is said,
not in disparagement of the very excel-
lent pictures recently taken here by Eu-
ropoon artists, but in commendation
of the skill of the young Siamese Pho-
tographer. And by the way, the Siam-
ese I think are entitled to more credit
in artistic skill than they recieve. I have
recently seen some paintings of a Siam-
ese, representing the fruits of his
country, which in form, colours and
finish discover much taste and genius.
And when these amateur artists re-
ceive the encouragement and culture
they deserve, Siam is to furnish to the
world something more than masters of
marine and monastic architecture, and
in addition to the fleet of merchant ships
and Steamers which now occupy the
river and the line of Consular buildings,
dwelling houses, steam mills and
merchant establishments, which adorn
its banks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We may see in the no distant future
of Siam halls of learning, temples ded-
icated to the culture of science and the
fine arts and the general prevalence of
literature and refinement found in the
most enlightened countries of the
western world. The people are capable
of it, the government is looking for it,
and many intelligent minds in the
land are inquiring after the history and
habits of other countries, and longing
for a nearer affiliation with the more
civilized nations of the earth. Even
now, Siam is not a whit behind many
so called enlightened nations in some
of the noblest traits of a nation's great-
ness and surest marks of national pro-
gress. I allude to the toleration of free
speech, a free press, and the free enjoy-
ment of religious worship whether Bud-
hist, or Mohomedan, Papist or Pro-
testant, every man is allowed to wor-
ship according to his own conscience,
and is protected in his religious serv-
ices. How long since the subjects of
France or England were allowed such
complete toleration!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Here every religion is allowed to
have her own temples, print her own sa-
cred books, publish her own creed, and
give her doctrines a fair chance to
stand or fall according to the decisions
of truth, after an impartial hearing by
the public. I know not where to look
for clearer proof of national enlighten-
ment or a surer pledge of a nation's
progress, than this one principle of
religious toleration. Truth asks only
for an open field and fair play. Ignorance
and error ask also for the prop of the
civil arm. Let Siam perpetuate her prin-
ciples of toleration, encourage the arts,
and education, and with the blessing
of Heaven, she may soon stand by
the side of the most enlightened nations
of the world. {{< news/indent4 >}} D.{{< /news/text >}}

Prussia.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is surmised in Prussia that Parli-
ment has met for the last time during
the present reign. There is consid-
erable excitement. The Bourse is ag-
itated. The funds have fallen. The
Berlin populace exhibit signs of temper.
It is not expected however, that the
storm will burst. Still, the coup-d'-
etat may be followed by unlooked-for
results. Prussia's difficulty is Austri-
a's opportunity. The Emperor's ad-
visers are assuming a bolder tone, and
if it be true that they have dispatched
fresh troops to Holstein, the minion
of the Prussian Court may see cause
to repent at leisure what he did in
haste. That the two leading German
Powers will come to blows is not very
probable, since it would suit the
present position of neither. But, in
the event of any breakdown in Bis-
mark's foreign policy, the domestic
embarrassment which he has on his
hands will be greatly increased. He
has staked every thing on one throw.
Should it turn up against him, his
prospects will be unenviable indeed.
Perhaps there is no statesman in Eu-
rope whose future is more precarious, or
to whom, should he trip in his auda-
cious career, the words of our great
dramatic bard would be more applic-
able—-{{< /news/text >}}

THE CONSUL AT BANGKOK.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}(March 6th.) Mr. WYLD (Bodmin)
asked the Under Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs whether Mr. Knox,
Her Majesty's Consul at Bangkok,
had returned to his post; why he
quitted it; and if any one was left in
charge at the consulate during the
absence of Mr. Knox.—Mr. LAYARD
said that Mr. Knox, Her Majesty's
Consul at Bangkok, had returned to
his post, which he had quitted in con-
sequence of very important affairs
connected with British interests. The
Government entirely approved his
proceedings. In his absence he had
left an officer of great ability and ex-
perience, perfectly competent to ma-
nage affairs, in charge of the consulate.

{{< news/text >}}PICTURE OF THE SIAMESE AMBASSA-
DORS AT FONTAINEBLEAU.-—At the last
annual exhibition of paintings in Pa-
ris one of the most remarkable pic-
tures was that by Gerome—-just elect-
ed, by the way, a member of the
French Academy of Fine Arts—re-
presenting the reception of the Am-
bassadoors of the King of Siam by the
Emperor and Empress. As regards
the Embassy, the painter achieved a
great success, in spite of the awkward
attitudes and positions of the principle
figures, who are on all fours, in a pro-
cession which reaches nearly all across
the canvas. M. Gerome has caught
the expressions of the countenances so
happily, and has rendered the dresses
so brilliantly, that the group is highly
interesting: the face and figure of the
boy, son of one of the Ambasadoors,
are admirable. The Siamese were de-
lighted with the picture, and insisted
on having a copy made and sent to
Bangkok for the King. The artist
has just completed a reduced copy for
this purpose, and is said to have been
very successful in plagiarising himself.
It was a pity not to have done the
thing imperially, and made the repro-
duction of the full size, for no amount
of art can give the same bold effect in
a diminished space, and boldness more
than highly artistic finish would be of
importance in the present case. We
have no doubt that the representation
of the curious and glittering ceremony
will cause at least as much sensation
at Bangkok as it did in Paris, but we
trust that the painter will escape the
White Elephant. {{< news/indent2 >}} L. & C. Express.{{< /news/text >}}

made a petition soliciting interference

has had such pernicious effects on

abomination it creates. Professor
Bushell has been entertaining the in-

exhibitions, such as, illustrations of

of spirit-rapping. It is said that he
proved particularly successful in Elec-

were wonderful. He drew forth shouts

{{< news/text >}}THE QUESTION NOT YET DECIDED!—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"It is very nearly a hundred years

remarks at the close, 'I long to hear

What is the opinion of Lord Auchin-
leck, or Lord Hailes, or Lord Mon-
boddo.'"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This question will not be satisfac-
torily decided until the negro has
secured to him all those civil, social
and religious rights which white men
claim for themselves. The sooner
nations and individuals yield that point,
the sooner the negro question will be
decided. The negro is a man, and as
such his rights must be conceded, or
there will be agitation. It cannot be
helped. The South denied the negro
his rights, and so came the war. All
