BANGKOK MAY 16th.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We have been favored with a note from<br/>
His Excellency Chow Phya Sri Surij Wong,<br/>
stating that M. Aubaret H. I. M. Consul at<br/>
this place had addressed a note to him,<br/>
inquiring if the Siamese Government sent<br/>
us on the Treaty lately concluded between<br/>
France and Siam, and which appeared in<br/>
the last issue of the Recorder. He also<br/>
requests that we will inform him for the<br/>
gratification of M. Aubaret, by what means<br/>
we obtained the Treaty. This of course<br/>
we can not do. The Siamese Government<br/>
did not send us the Treaty but had they<br/>
done so, they had a perfect right to do it,<br/>
and neither M. Aubaret, nor any one else<br/>
had any business to ask them why they<br/>
did it. We would like to see this people<br/>
manifest for once at least, a little more of<br/>
that essential element rather vulgarly de-<br/>
nominated "back bone." Their prompt<br/>
answer to M. Aubaret should have been<br/>
that they did not furnish the Treaty but<br/>
had it been published at their request they<br/>
had a perfect right to do so, without any<br/>
breach of etiquette. After all the teaching<br/>
they have had, this people have failed to<br/>
learn the important lesson, that the "bark<br/>
is often worse than the bite." True the<br/>
Treaty has not yet been ratified by France,<br/>
but there is not the slightest doubt but she<br/>
will speedily ratify it. She will readily<br/>
ratify any treaty that will give her control<br/>
of a kingdom at so little expense. It is<br/>
therefore presuming too much for M. Au-<br/>
baret to suppose that the community here<br/>
are to remain in ignorance whilst the Treaty<br/>
is going to France and returning.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We publish also in this issue another<br/>
treaty concluded between the French Con-<br/>
sul and Hluang Bawriboon Soon-ra Kawn,<br/>
the Spirit Farmer. This appeared in the<br/>
Siamese of our last issue, and was trans-<br/>
lated and sot up for the English, but by<br/>
some means it was overlooked until too late<br/>
to insert it, and it consquenlty failed to<br/>
appear. Taken from the Siamese of our<br/>
last it has since appeared in another place,<br/>
and we only now insert it because we think<br/>
it should be preserved as a diplomatic<br/>
curiosity. We don't wonder that the authors<br/>
of such a concern should desire to throw a<br/>
vail over it to keep it from the public. So<br/>
far as can be ascertained it had already<br/>
gone into effect, as far as it was possible<br/>
for such a thing to take effect, and was be-<br/>
ing copied and sent around to the different<br/>
spirit dealers. There is no doubt but the<br/>
authors of this treaty thought that it could<br/>
be a private affair between France and Siam,<br/>
without effecting other treaty powers.<br/>
Mr. Hluang Dawriboon must have been only<br/>
a passive instrument, as those very much<br/>
higher in authority had a "finger in the<br/>
pie." It of course amounts to nothing, but<br/>
did it amount to any thing the same ben-<br/>
efits would also accrue to the other treaty<br/>
powers.

AMERICAN GENERALS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 73)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
W. S. Rosecrans bid fair at one time to<br/>
be a star of the first magnitude in the<br/>
galaxy of American generals. Before the<br/>
rebellion broke out he had resigned his<br/>
commission in the army, and retired to<br/>
scientific pursuits. But like many others<br/>
when the Old Flag was fired at, he rushed<br/>
to the rescue. He was placed under Mc-<br/>
Clellan in Western Virginia and when the<br/>
latter was called to Washington, Rosecrans<br/>
was left in command. He did up his work<br/>
there admirably, and after a short time<br/>
was sent west to Grant's command. While<br/>
under Grant he gained two signal victories,<br/>
one at luka, and another at Corinth. For<br/>
these he was raised to the rank of Major<br/>
General of volunteers. When it was de-<br/>
cided to remove Gen. Buell from the com-<br/>
mand of the army of the Cumberland, Rose-<br/>
crans was promoted to that command. Af-<br/>
ter taking command he spent some time in<br/>
preparations, and then met the rebel army<br/>
under Bragg, at Murfreesboro Tennessee,<br/>
and after five days hard fighting he com-<br/>
pletely routed the rebels. During those<br/>
days of fighting he displayed great ability,<br/>
and great bravery. He rode into the heat<br/>
of the battle and showed a masterly ability,<br/>
in massing his troops just where they were<br/>
needed. He has few superiors any where<br/>
as a mathematician. His march from Mur-<br/>
freesboro to Chattanooga was a perfect<br/>
triumph. He also forced an evacuation<br/>
of that place with very little fighting. He<br/>
advanced his army beyond Chattanooga to<br/>
Chicamauga creek. Gen. Lee having a lit-<br/>
tle leasure in Virginia dispatched two divis-<br/>
ions of his army to join Bragg and crush<br/>
Rosecrans. They attacked Rosecrans at<br/>
Chicamauga and well nigh succeeded in<br/>
their designs. The skill and bravery exhib-<br/>
ited by him at Murfreesboro appeared on<br/>
this occasion to forsake him, and he left<br/>
the field without knowing whether the bat-<br/>
tle was gained or lost. Had it not been for<br/>
Gen. Thomas the army would have been<br/>
destroyed. When that department was in<br/>
cluded in Grant's command, Rosecrans was<br/>
removed and placed in command in Mis-<br/>
souri, but even there he was slow and has<br/>
lately been shelved.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
None of the American generals has risen<br/>
more slowly, and at the same time more<br/>
surely than Lieut. Gen. U. S. Grant. He<br/>
came from that working class, which has<br/>
furnished the United States, most of her a-<br/>
blest men in all departments. About one<br/>
hundred years ago two brothers named<br/>
Grant, came from Scotland to the New<br/>
World. One of them settled in Westmore-<br/>
land county, Pennsylvania, where the<br/>
father of the present Lieut. Gen. was born<br/>
in 1794 and received the name of Jesse.<br/>
In 1799 the family moved west and set-<br/>
tled in Ohio. At that time not a single<br/>
state had yet been formed of all that vast<br/>
region lying between the Alleghany and<br/>
Rocky mountains. It formed a vast hunt-<br/>
ing ground for the Indian. The great<br/>
Tecumseh was a leading chief, and bloody<br/>
battles were fought around the dwelling<br/>
of the Grants. In 1806 when the Western<br/>
Reserve became partially settled, the Grants<br/>
removed to Deerfield where the grand fath-<br/>
er of the present general died, leaving his<br/>
father Jesse an orphan boy aged eleven<br/>
years, with no one to guide or assist him<br/>
in his way through the world.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
He soon discovered however that he<br/>
must get his living by labor, and it was<br/>
necessary to select some calling that would<br/>
pay him best. He therefore learned the<br/>
tanning, which he followed until sixty years<br/>
old when he retired. Inured to pioneer life<br/>
he carved his way alone to an honorable<br/>
position in society and wealth. In 1821<br/>
Jesse Grant married Miss Hannah Simpson<br/>
and they settled at Point Pleasant, in<br/>
Clermont County, Ohio, on the Ohio River.<br/>
Here on April 27th 1822 a son was born<br/>
in an humble frame cottage still standing,<br/>
and valued before the War at about $300.<br/>
The boy's maternal grand-mother was<br/>
quite a reader of history, and had taken<br/>
quite a fancy to Ulysses the great Grecian<br/>
General who defeated the Trojans by his<br/>
strategy of the wooden horse, and she desir-<br/>
ed to have her grandson called Ulysses.<br/>
His grand-father wanted him called Hiram,<br/>
so the two names were united and he was<br/>
called Hiram Ulysses.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
But when his name was handed into Con-<br/>
gress for his appointment to West Point,<br/>
by some mistake it was handed in Ulysses<br/>
and has remained so ever since. Many<br/>
stories are now told of his boyhood which,<br/>
whether true or not would never have been<br/>
thought of again, had he not attained to his<br/>
present position. It is certain however<br/>
that during his early boyhood he exhibited<br/>
nothing very brilliant, but was one of that<br/>
faithful diligent kind that slowly and surely<br/>
make their mark. He worked at the tan-<br/>
ning with his father, and it is said that he<br/>
was accustomed to rise early in the morning<br/>
make the fires,—-milk his mother's cows,<br/>
and then go to work in the yard until<br/>
breakfast time. An incident is related of<br/>
his boyhood which illustrates his present<br/>
character to a great degree.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
His father one day desired some sticks<br/>
of hewn timber for a certain purpose, and<br/>
told Ulysses to harness the team, and drive<br/>
to the woods, where he would find the<br/>
timber, and men waiting to load it. The<br/>
boy ever fond of driving was soon on the<br/>
spot where he found the timber but no men.<br/>
What was he to do? Most boys would have<br/>
gone home again but such was not the case<br/>
of the tanner boy. Looking around he saw<br/>
a tree which had fallen against another so<br/>
as to form an inclined plain. He saw at<br/>
once he could make the horses do the part<br/>
of the workmen. So he hitched the team<br/>
to each of the logs and drew them near the<br/>
inclined plain. Then drawing them piece<br/>
by piece up the inclined plain and balanc-<br/>
ing them around, he managed to draw them<br/>
on the wagon and drove home in triumph.<br/>
The only school advantages Ulysses had<br/>
until seventeen years of age, were four or<br/>
five months of each year in the district<br/>
school, spending the other months of the<br/>
year in labor.

FRENCH IN COCHIN CHINA
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Translated from Revue des Deux Mondes
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The public feelings and opinions in these<br/>
latter years have been freely expressed and<br/>
are adverse to distant expeditions. After<br/>
out intervention in China, our war with Mexi-<br/>
co, and our occupation of Lower Cochin<br/>
China, the public became alarmed at the<br/>
great expenses that these operations<br/>
brought on the finances of the country.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Questions were made as to the National<br/>
Interest, whether they improved our in<br/>
fluence, and if the attainment of them would<br/>
secure us from the embarrassments which<br/>
were made in obtaining them. It is no<br/>
doubt the duty of great Governments to<br/>
originate great designs and to show that<br/>
they can accomplish them, thereby proving<br/>
to the world that they have the power and<br/>
resources to do so, but that they may be of<br/>
use they should be well timed, so that they<br/>
may not be followed by embarrassments to<br/>
the contrary. If this is doubted we have<br/>
only to look at what is now passing. The<br/>
capture of Algiers was a glorious Legacy<br/>
of the Restoration of 1830. Those who un-<br/>
dertook it were not aware that France was<br/>
engaged in a Revolution which gave rise<br/>
to all the difficulties that ensued to its<br/>
Government both internally and exter-<br/>
nally and which new establishments have<br/>
always to encounter. We had for a long<br/>
time to support the military operations<br/>
which the resistance of the Arabs neces-<br/>
sitated, and to display our strength to<br/>
those ill disposed European Powers whom<br/>
we had to oppose. No one can imagine<br/>
the embarrassment these caused to our<br/>
general politics, when we had to found<br/>
an independent Belgie, and later to settle<br/>
the Eastern question and to resume our<br/>
proper stand in the European States.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
From its position as a great European<br/>
Power, France is more obliged to have its<br/>
forces united than to have them scattered,<br/>
and to fulfil her mission she ought ever to<br/>
be ready to meet the eventualities of Con-<br/>
tinental politics. To be wanting in these<br/>
duties, in the present state of Europe, would<br/>
be a folly which would not only compro-<br/>
mise the renown of our statesmen, but also<br/>
that which is of more importance to us, the<br/>
dignity and power of our country.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The Government however so far from be-<br/>
ing appalled, met those difficulties, and al-<br/>
though they were difficult for the ministry<br/>
they were not without glory, and gained<br/>
the good will of the public, thus becoming<br/>
Popular, they soon were National. Thus<br/>
one of the greatest achievements of the<br/>
Government of 1830 shows us what can be<br/>
gained by undertaking foreign expeditions,<br/>
with liberal discussions and publicity.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Probably some persons will be more con-<br/>
vinced after reading what has been effected<br/>
under very different conditions—That of<br/>
the expedition of Cochin China.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
In 1858 the war of China, where our flag<br/>
floated with that of Great Britian, was the<br/>
first phase accomplished. The forts of Pee-<br/>
ho fell to the allied Powers, and the Treaty<br/>
of Tien-tein was signed. Peace with the<br/>
Celestial Empire appeared assured and no<br/>
one could suppose that the Pekin Court<br/>
would have by its bad faith provoked a re-<br/>
newal of hostilities, and by its conduct<br/>
rendered it imperiously necessary a few<br/>
months after to carry hostilities into the<br/>
very capital. It was between the signing<br/>
of these treaties, that the French thought<br/>
of the wrongs they had to settle with the<br/>
Kingdom of Annam. The Court of Hue.<br/>
had not only persecuted most cruelly the<br/>
inhabitants who had become Christians,<br/>
but also the foreign missionaries, without<br/>
respect to their Nationality. Mons Diaz<br/>
Bishop of Tonquin after suffering a long<br/>
imprisonment, died on the 20th July 1857<br/>
under cruel tortures, a martyr. The French<br/>
and Spanish missionaries spread over Co-<br/>
chin China, had appealed to Paris and<br/>
Madrid, making sad complaints, and claim-<br/>
ed the protection of the two Catholic Gov-<br/>
ernments, more for the religion to which<br/>
they were devoted, than for their lives<br/>
which they were ready to sacrifice, follow-<br/>
ing the example of their glorious Bishop.<br/>
We had several times made applications to<br/>
the Annam Government and demanded re-<br/>
parations for what had passed and guaran-<br/>
tees for the future, but they refused to ne-<br/>
gotiate with us, and fired at the vessel on<br/>
board of which were the French representa-<br/>
tives. It was under these circumstances<br/>
that orders were given to Admiral Rigault<br/>
de Genouilly, who commanded our naval<br/>
station in China, to proceed with his ships<br/>
against the Annamites and oblige them to<br/>
give us satisfaction. The Spaniards from Man-<br/>
illa joined our expedition with a contingent<br/>
of troops.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
It is not our wish to enter into any details<br/>
of the military operations prolonged from<br/>
1858 to 1863 under the command of Ad-<br/>
mirals Rigault de Genonilly, Page, Charner,<br/>
and Bonard, who successively commanded<br/>
them. What imports us to know is not<br/>
how the war was carried on, but what<br/>
politics guided our movements.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Had Admiral Rigault de Genouilly pre-<br/>
cise instructions? Was he aware of what<br/>
he was to attain! Was the idea conceived<br/>
in Paris of profiting by the occasion thus<br/>
afforded, by the insolent obstinacy of the<br/>
King of Annam, to take from him a part of<br/>
his Kingdom, and there found an establish-<br/>
ment under the sovereignity of France!<br/>
And if such resolutions were made, had we<br/>
considered the difficulties and obstacles<br/>
which we might meet? Had we foreseen<br/>
how far our efforts were to be carried, and<br/>
the importance of the sacrifices which ac-<br/>
company such an enterprize?
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The documents that we have consulted<br/>
differ in the answers which should be given<br/>
to these questions. Some say that our<br/>
Naval forces were only to go to the coasts<br/>
of Cochin China, and there to give a milit-<br/>
ary demonstration as a moral support of<br/>
the persecuted missionary cause, and to<br/>
get the Annam Government, to make a<br/>
convention guaranteeing the free propaga-<br/>
tion of the Catholic Religion, and the rights<br/>
of humanity. Other documents on the con-<br/>
trary would have us believe that the orders<br/>
given to Admiral Rigault de Genonilly,<br/>
were the result of long reflection and tended<br/>
to carry out a project wisely conceived. To<br/>
take a position in the Extreme East would<br/>
be renewing our old traditions, and make<br/>
us faithful to a National Policy transmitted<br/>
under the different Revolutions which have<br/>
taken place in France.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
What then was this National policy? and<br/>
what were these traditions? It is remem-<br/>
bered that in 1787 George Pegnean de<br/>
Behain, Bishop of Adras after having saved<br/>
from the civil wars, Gra-long, the lawful<br/>
inheritor of the throne of Anam, came to<br/>
solieit the aid of the Court of Versailles,<br/>
for his Royal Protege, and that in the<br/>
quality of Minister of this claimant, he<br/>
signed with M. Montorin the Minister for<br/>
Foreign Affairs of Louis XVI, a treaty by<br/>
which the King of Cochin China, in conse-<br/>
quence of having placed at his disposal an<br/>
auxilliary corps, ceded to France the Pen-<br/>
insula of Tourane, and the island of Pulo<br/>
Condor, and gave to our commerce and<br/>
to our Mercantile Marine conditions that<br/>
no other nations or states enjoyed. The<br/>
Bishop of Adras gained by this treaty<br/>
great authority, and being assisted by<br/>
several Frenchmen whose names are<br/>
not forgotten in Cochin China, succeeded<br/>
after many adverse vicissitudes, in placing<br/>
his Protege Gra-long in triumph. Did<br/>
these however become of any impor-<br/>
tance? One thing is certain, that in 1857<br/>
the Government submitted the treaty of the<br/>
Bishop of Adras and M. Montmorin to a<br/>
commission, who after a long and patient<br/>
investigation, were forced to admit that<br/>
France being taken up and engaged by the<br/>
events of the Revolution of 1789, did not<br/>
carry out the principles of the treaty, and<br/>
in consequence they ought to consider it<br/>
null and void. It was also recollected that<br/>
in 1843 Admiral Cecil accompanying the<br/>
mission of M. Lu Grené, was ordered in<br/>
concert with him to search in the extreme<br/>
East, for a place where under the shelter of<br/>
our own flag, our commerce and our marine<br/>
should find permanant protection.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The instructions of M. Guizot then min-<br/>
ister of Foreign Affairs are cited, who said,<br/>
"It is not for France to be wanting in that<br/>
part of the world, where already the other<br/>
Nations of Europe are established. In case<br/>
of ship wreck our vessels ought not to be<br/>
without a place to repair, and not be ob-<br/>
lidged to go to the Portuguese Colony of<br/>
Macao, the English port of Hong Kong, or<br/>
the arsenal of Caviéto in the Spanish island<br/>
of Luaon.” These instructions show great<br/>
prudence, in excluding by the selection to<br/>
be made, full possession of an extensive ter-<br/>
ritory, which would bring us in constant<br/>
quarrels with these numerous populations. <br/>
They recommend to give the preference to<br/>
an island where it would be easy to remain<br/>
in peace, away from all hostile neighbors,<br/>
in a favorable situation for health and re-<br/>
victualling. M. Lagrone and Admiral Cocile,<br/>
in execution of these projects, cast their<br/>
eyes on the Isle of Basilan, situated near<br/>
Mandano, at the extremity of the Sooloo<br/>
Archipelago, they landed a force there and<br/>
obtained a cession of it from the Sultan of<br/>
Sooloo, but immediately the Governor of<br/>
the Phillippines protested, and claimed it as<br/>
part of the Spanish territories, which was<br/>
backed by the cabinet of Madrid. M.<br/>
Guizot was engaged at the time with the<br/>
very difficult and delicate negotiations of<br/>
the Spanish marriage, and considering it<br/>
best to drop the lesser question for the<br/>
greater, resigned for the time the contested<br/>
subject.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Such are the two explanations that are<br/>
given to us in regard to our first operations<br/>
in Cochin China. Without giving our<br/>
opinion on the one or the other, it is to be<br/>
believed that concerning the acts of Ad-<br/>
miral Rigaulte de Genonilly, first our aims<br/>
were not very ambitious. The Admiral<br/>
led the force under him to the bay of<br/>
Tourane, took possession of and destroyed<br/>
the two forts which defended it, and be-<br/>
came master of the Peninsula of Champ<br/>
Callao. His intention was to attack Hue<br/>
the capital of Cochin China, distant about<br/>
15 leagues from Tourane, and 6 leagues<br/>
from the sea, and to get there by the river<br/>
which was obstructed by sandy shoals.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The brave Admiral wished to take his<br/>
artillery up this river to Hue, and compel<br/>
the King Tu-due to make a treaty, but the<br/>
N. E. Monsoon then blowing rendered this<br/>
hazardous, and an expedition by land with<br/>
the small force under him was not practica-<br/>
ble. Soon he formed another project. He<br/>
was surrounded by European Jesuit mis-<br/>
sionaries, who although after so long a so-<br/>
journ in the country had but vague illusive<br/>
ideas of their power with the natives. They<br/>
confidently told him, that the Annamites<br/>
were so vexed and oppressed that they on-<br/>
ly waited the appearance of our forces when<br/>
they would rise in a body and receive us<br/>
as liberators. The combats that we had at<br/>
Tourane, ought to have guarded us from<br/>
giving any credit to such language; but they<br/>
persuaded the Admiral that on another<br/>
part of the coast we sould meet with a dif-<br/>
ferent reception, saying that the christian<br/>
population was spread about Saigon, and<br/>
we should be assisted by them. The salub-<br/>
rity of lower Cochin China, the numberless<br/>
runs of water, the facility of blockading the<br/>
city and cutting off the supplies of rice, ren-<br/>
dered the attempt altogether propitious,<br/>
and determined the Admiral to abandon<br/>
Tourane and to direct his steps towards<br/>
Lower Cochin China, which he did on the<br/>
7th Feb. 1859.<br/>
We did not find as we advanced the pro-<br/>
mised auxiliaries, as that part of the popula-<br/>
tion who had become christians were a<br/>
miserable set, without influence being both<br/>
enervated and abject; and who trembled be-<br/>
fore the mandarins; whereas the Annamites<br/>
unconverted, formed the majority of the<br/>
population; and so attached to their chiefs,<br/>
having the same faith and ideas from the<br/>
lowest to the highest.

{{< news/text >}}
Attached to their usages with great<br/>
submission, and having from their infancy<br/>
been taught to consider Europeans as the<br/>
most barbarious race, they were from the<br/>
first hostile and determined to consider us<br/>
as invaders of their rights.
{{< /news/text >}}

Saigon was defended by two forts and a<br/>
formidable citadel built in the last century,<br/>
by the Frenchmen who accompanied the<br/>
Bishop of Adras. The runs of water sup-<br/>
plying the city were guarded by foots and<br/>
stockades, secured with iron bars, and defen-<br/>
ded by batteries. The Admiral did not<br/>
hesitate to attack these obstacles, and un-<br/>
der his vigorous command, our soldiers al-<br/>
though strongly resisted, soon succeeded<br/>
in destroying them. These events were<br/>
accomplished without having the least ef-<br/>
fect upon the Annamite Government.<br/>
Their army fell back and concentrated about<br/>
four miles from Saigon, at Ke-hoa, in an<br/>
attitude that showed their losses had not<br/>
discouraged them. At the same time, on<br/>
the side of Touran, Tu-due's troops made<br/>
an offensive movement, and made at the<br/>
mouth of the river, to the South of the Bay,<br/>
a series of works for the prevention of all<br/>
attempts by troops against that position.<br/>
The Admiral therefore had to give battle<br/>
in the Province of Saigon, and before Tour-<br/>
ane to force the Cochin Chinese to fight,<br/>
retreating on their capital. Once more we<br/>
had to abandon Touran, a part of the force<br/>
being recalled to China, to undertake that<br/>
second Campaign which carried our victo-<br/>
rious forces to Pekin, while we occupied<br/>
Saigon with 700 men.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
During two years, until the conclusion<br/>
of peace with the Celestial Empire, this<br/>
handful of Frenchmen kept off the Annamite<br/>
army, they were obliged to be shut up in<br/>
the town, and cut off from all communic-<br/>
ations. Vice Admiral Page in the inter-<br/>
val arrived from France, to succeed Ad-<br/>
miral Rigault de Genouilly in the command.<br/>
He knew the wishes of the French Govern-<br/>
ment. There were no ideas at that time of<br/>
conquest, or of forming in Cochin China a<br/>
great establishment, although it is wished<br/>
to be believed, since that the orders to that<br/>
officer were most modest. They permitted<br/>
him to propose to the Court of Hue a<br/>
treaty without pecuniary indemnities, and<br/>
without cession of territory, but to stipulate<br/>
liberty for our Missionaries to teach their<br/>
religion in such a manner as not to trouble<br/>
the Annamite administration, and also to<br/>
stipulate for the residence of French Con-<br/>
suls in three ports of Cochin China, and an<br/>
"Envoy Charge 'd' affaire" from France<br/>
every three years.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Negotiations were commenced on these<br/>
bases, but the plenipotentiary of Tu-duc<br/>
raised all kinds of difficulties to prevent<br/>
the treaty being signed, which compromi-<br/>
ed him in the eyes of his Government, al-<br/>
though they were convinced that we would<br/>
be glad to leave and go to sea without<br/>
striking a blow. This equivocal state ex-<br/>
isted when the peace with China allowed<br/>
Admiral Charneir, who then commanded<br/>
our naval forces, to take a part of them to<br/>
Cochin China. He recommenced hostili-<br/>
ties, blockaded Saigon and took possession<br/>
of all the Province of Gra-duih, which is<br/>
the capital, and a short time after of the<br/>
Province of Mitho.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
A second negotiation than ensued, but<br/>
without any better success than the first, so<br/>
Admiral Bonard who then commanded,<br/>
continued the warfare, and forwarded the<br/>
conquests, extending them to a third Pro-<br/>
vince that of Bien-hoa By the force of<br/>
circumstances (it said in an Official Re-<br/>
port) the end first proposed had been<br/>
singularly overpast, and we became con-<br/>
querors when we only went simply to re-<br/>
dress grievances.<br/>
    These repeated attacks at length disquiet-<br/>
ed Tu-duc and he decided to ask for peace.<br/>
Admiral Bonard seized the occasion so long<br/>
looked for, but still being in doubt he sent<br/>
the steamer "Forbin" to Hué, to be assured<br/>
of the disposition of the Annamite Govern-<br/>
ment, whether they were serious, or only<br/>
wished to gain time to bring supplies of<br/>
rice into the capital. The King being<br/>
convinced that he had no way of carrying<br/>
on the old way of negotiating, charged the<br/>
ministers of the Rites, and of his Armies to<br/>
go to Saigon, where on the 5th June 1862<br/>
they signed a treaty with the representa-<br/>
tives of the Emperor of the French. We<br/>
subjoin the principal part of this treaty.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The subjects of France and Spain can<br/>
exercise the Christian religion in the king-<br/>
dom of Annam, and the subjects of that<br/>
kingdom without distinction, who may de-<br/>
sire to embrace the Christian religion, are<br/>
allowed to do so without restraint, but no<br/>
one is to be forced to embrace Christianity<br/>
against their will.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The three Provinces, Bien-hoa, Gra-<br/>

This Deplomatic act gave us a new life<br/>
in Cochin China, and imposed new obliga-<br/>
tions upon us. By our sovereignty in<br/>
lieu of that of the King of Annam over<br/>
this extended territory, we took upon our-<br/>
selves towards our new subjects, the duties<br/>
of giving to them the blessings of a superior<br/>
civilization to that they had know; deve-<br/>
loping their resources and guaranteeing their<br/>
security.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Our first care ought to be to inspire the<br/>
Annamites, with full confidence of our re-<br/>
solution to keep forever the conquests we<br/>
have made. Our evacuation of Tourane<br/>
made them think that we only occupied<br/>
their country casually, and were ready to<br/>
abandon it on the least reverse, or embar-<br/>
rassment. They were not ignorant that the<br/>
Court of Hué in signing the treaty had<br/>
yeilded only to our menaces, and they kept<br/>
up the hope of seizing the first occasion to<br/>
retake the territory thus ceded to us. As<br/>
long as they imagined this we could not<br/>
depend upon their fidelity. Notwithstand-<br/>
ing the peace, the Christians who were sus-<br/>
pected of having called us to Cochin China,<br/>
were in their eyes guilty of rebellion to their<br/>
sovereign, and deserved the greatest of<br/>
punishments and torments, the Annamites<br/>
who witnessed the butchery of many of<br/>
those accused of treason, were impressed<br/>
with terror, and would not expose themsel-<br/>
ves to Tu-duc's vengeance.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
These facts presented great difficulties<br/>
both moral and material, but before exam-<br/>
ining what was determined to be done, it<br/>
is necessary to show how France had to<br/>
display her ability and power.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The three provinces that we had, at such<br/>
a great distance, joined to the French Em-<br/>
pire, are of great importance both topograph-<br/>
ically and o : account of their rich territory.<br/>
They formed in the Annam Kingdom a sort<br/>
of viceroyalty and altogether was nominated<br/>
Gra-duih or Lower Cochin China, and es-<br/>
pecially lately it has been so called, the<br/>
chief station was Saigon. Natural bound-<br/>
ries surrounds and protects all the territory.<br/>
On the East and North, our new posessions<br/>
are surrounded by a chain of mountains,<br/>
which guards them from all attacks. The<br/>
danger can only come from the side of the<br/>
sea, where the country is flat, but here the<br/>
fire of our cannon will repel the assailants.<br/>
The West and South limits are Cambodia<br/>
and the Sea, but thanks to the rivers which<br/>
facilitates its defences, the dangers within<br/>
and without are no longer to be feared.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The total superficies of this territory may<br/>
be estimated at 1600 square leagues, and<br/>
the population about 1,000,000. Two rivers<br/>
the Dormey, and the Cambodia, and sev-<br/>
eral made canals surround the three provin-<br/>
ces. Saigon the most important part of the<br/>
Annam kingdom is the seat of our Gover-<br/>
nment. In the bay of Vin-tan where ship<br/>
can some and find excellent anchorage and<br/>
shelter, there are neither rocks, nor shoals.<br/>
Saigon is in so admirable position, it is in<br/>
communication with the sea distant about<br/>
15 leagues, and it forms a grand centre for<br/>
commercial enterprises with Indo-China<br/>
and Europe. The inhabitance are mild and<br/>
timid and easily governed—they are not<br/>
(as in supposed) plunged in ignorance and<br/>
barbarity, although they are Buddhists.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
There is a regular and permanent army<br/>
recruited under certain regulations, besides<br/>
a militia which is raised in the provinces<br/>
according to the wants of the state in peace<br/>
or war, but chiefly to defend them from<br/>
the pirates and the eruptions of the people<br/>
of the mountains.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Such is the aspect of Lower Cochin<br/>
China, we should not be surprised that af-<br/>
ter these first reports of our officers, those<br/>
most interested in this distant enterprise<br/>
should take such enthusiastic view of its<br/>
future. "It is not a colony that we have<br/>
gained for France, it is a Kingdom.

RACHABUREE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
For the Bangkok Recorder.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
This place is noted for being the prin-<br/>
cipal depot of Sapan-wood for the western<br/>
side of the gulf. It is situated on the Ma-<br/>
klawng river about a day’s journey from its<br/>
mouth, and nearly at the head of tide wa-<br/>
ter. At this place the river is narrow, the<br/>
banks high, and, in the dry season, the<br/>
water very low; but always navigable at<br/>
highest tides for medium sized native boats.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The river below the town is beautifully<br/>
ornamented in many places with bamboo,<br/>
tamarind and mangoe groves. Some of these<br/>
are most romantic and inviting in their ap-<br/>
pearance, especialy those on the western<br/>
bank where the delicious “mango apples<br/>
grow."
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Whether Rachaburee would be called a<br/>
“walled town” or not, might be a disputed<br/>
question. There is both a wall and a town<br/>
it is true; but the town is one place, and<br/>
the wall another. Doubtless the wall did<br/>
at one time surround the town, but now<br/>
the enclosure, excepting the Governor’s<br/>
residence and a few other buildings, is either<br/>
waste land or cultivated rice fields.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The walls, towers, gateways &c, are yet in<br/>
a good state of preservation, and have the<br/>
same general appearance, and look as<br/>
though they might have been built about<br/>
the same age of the world with the forts,<br/>
walls &c, in Bangkok.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The town is now located between the<br/>
wall and the river. This change of location<br/>
has evidently been made for the purpose of<br/>
being nearer the water, and to accommodate<br/>
the Siamese who have a peculiar aversion<br/>
to any kind of wholesome and profitable<br/>
exercise.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Sapan-wood and ebony (mai muk'ka)<br/>
are brought here in large quantities from<br/>
the surrounding forests, during the dry sea-<br/>
son, whence they are taken in boats to<br/>
Bangkok. It is generally cut by the for-<br/>
esters and sold to men who make it their<br/>
business to collect and convey it in carts to<br/>
the town, where it again changes hands.<br/>
These teameasters travel in the night, and al-<br/>
ways go in companies of 20 to 50 wagons.<br/>
In the morning you will hear the sound of<br/>
their wheels long before they come in sight<br/>
—not the iron wheels, but the unpleasant<br/>
creaking sound of their unoiled wooden<br/>
axles. It is a slow and tedious process<br/>
bringing it across the country in ox-carts,<br/>
and a mere moiety is obtained compared<br/>
to what there might be if a good rail-road<br/>
or canal was constructed to these almost<br/>
inexhaustable forests of Sapan-wood. Be-<br/>
sides these, large rafts of bamboos, and<br/>
other timbers are brought down the river<br/>
from the forest above the town and taken<br/>
to Bangkok. These forests of valuable<br/>
wood, it appears, are free to any who wish<br/>
to cut. What great sources of wealth these<br/>
might become to the country if properly<br/>
worked; and how much the country needs<br/>
to be explored and surveyed to ascertain<br/>
what wealth it has.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
His Excellency the Prime Minister is<br/>
making preparations to build a brick house<br/>
in a most delightful place on the opposite<br/>
side of the river from the town, which will<br/>
greatly help the appearance of the place,<br/>
and afford accommodations for visitors.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
When the country is opened out and<br/>
improved, Rachaburee will become an im-<br/>
portant centre. It needs now only to be<br/>
connected with Nakawn-chaisee by a good<br/>
canal or rail-road to be in direct communica-<br/>
tion with the city, after the proposed im-<br/>
provements to the latter place are completed.<br/>
When this connection is made it will not<br/>
take much more to continue the line a very<br/>
little further to Petchaburee, where is situated<br/>
the beautiful country palace of His Majesty<br/>
the first king. In a country where canals<br/>
and rail-roads can be so easily constructed,<br/>
it it strange why His Majesty does not have<br/>
these places connected with the city by<br/>
rail, if for no other purpose than his own<br/>
accommodation in visiting the Royal coun-<br/>
try palace.

THE SUGAR DISTRICT OF
NAKAWN-CHEISEE
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The cane plantations of Nak'awn Choi-<br/>
see lie almost entirely south of the town of<br/>
this name, between it and a point not far<br/>
from ten miles from the mouth of the<br/>
Ta-cheen river. The centre of the district<br/>
is about due west from Bangkok, to which<br/>
point the Siamese government contemplate<br/>
cutting a large canal with a carriage road<br/>
on its bank in the course of the next twelve<br/>
months.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The cane fields are quite charming in the<br/>
summer months, before the cane becomes<br/>
thick and heavy making the view monoton-<br/>
ous. As the banks of the river are general-<br/>
ly cleared of trees, the fields show well<br/>
from the river in times of full tide. Inter-<br/>
spersed among them are to be seen ban-<br/>
nana orchards, and indigo fields. The in-<br/>
digo plant usually occupies the space be-<br/>
tween those of the young cane, and is<br/>
brought to perfection before the latter re-<br/>
quires much room.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The cane is propagated by means of suck-<br/>
ers from the old stock, and these are set in<br/>
little pits made in the ground about 18<br/>
inches apart in every row. The time for plant-<br/>
ing them is from the beginning to the end<br/>
of the dry season. The young cane, as<br/>
well as the indigo plants among them, are<br/>
watered by means of long handled bas-<br/>
ket dippers, from deep artificial gutters,<br/>
charmingly straight and regular, dividing<br/>
the fields into mounds or beds, from ten to<br/>
twelve feet wide and a hundred yards or<br/>
more in length. The vital element is al-<br/>
ways present, even in the dry season, as<br/>
the flood tides daily replenish the ditches<br/>
with river water, coming within convenient<br/>
reach of the workman's dipper. You will<br/>
see the Chinamen (for the work is nearly<br/>
all done by them) scattered here and there,<br/>
about the fields, both morning and evening,<br/>
diligently irrigating their plants.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
In another direction, you will see the<br/>
workmen breaking up the fallow ground by<br/>
means of heavy and narrow grub hoes, at-<br/>
tached to handles six feet long. The hoe<br/>
is first lifted up as high as its handle will<br/>
admit of, is then brought down with full<br/>
fell strength, causing it to sink into the<br/>
ground some eight to ten inches. They by<br/>
a pry on the long lever, the stiff alluvial<br/>
soil is raised up, and left in lumps for the<br/>
first rain to soften and crumble.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
This, but too obviously, is a hard and<br/>
tedious mode of preparing their fields for<br/>
the cane, which doubtless would be greatly<br/>
improved by some of the Western ploughs.<br/>
There is here a prodigious expenditure of<br/>
human strength where strong buffalo teams,<br/>
with suitable ploughs, would perform the<br/>
work very much quicker and equally well.<br/>
In all these plains there are neither rocks<br/>
nor stumps to interfere with the gliding of<br/>
the plough. Here among the cane plan-<br/>
tations, as well as in all the surrounding pad-<br/>
dy fields, is a fine tract for the display of<br/>
European improvements, both in the turn-<br/>
ing up of the soil, and the cultivation of<br/>
the rice and the cane. A little guano would<br/>
probably improve the latter fifty per cent,<br/>
but even without this or any other manure<br/>
than that obtained by the annual overflow-<br/>
ing of the river, the crops, in ordinary<br/>
seasons, are far from being inferior.

A TREATY
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Between the French Consul and Hluang<br/>
Bawriboon Soora-kawn, the Spirit Farm-<br/>
er, translated from a Siamese Copy.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ARTICLE I. French liquors are [hereby]<br/>
permitted to be sold [in Bangkok] and<br/>
there is nothing to prevent it. The Spirit<br/>
Farmer will not interfere with any person<br/>
who has been duly licensed to traffic in<br/>
the same. Such a person shall be allowed<br/>
to sell the liquor as he pleases.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ARTICLE II. When any vessel shall ar-<br/>
rive in Bangkok having a consignment of<br/>
[French] liquors to any merchant, a report<br/>
of such consignment shall be made to the<br/>
French Consul, stating the number of cases,<br/>
and then said cases shall be delivered over<br/>
to the Consul, together with a certificate<br/>
from a proper officer in France, stating that<br/>
said cases of liquor are indeed French.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ARTICLE III. As soon as the French Con-<br/>
sul shall have heard of such consignment,<br/>
he shall inform the Spirit Farmer.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ARTICLE IV. When a merchant shall<br/>
desire to dispose of his [French] liquors to<br/>
a resident of Bangkok to retail for him or<br/>
in his place, he shall first inform the French<br/>
Consul, and then take the names of the<br/>
persons who wish to engage in said traffic,<br/>
stating how many persons there are and how<br/>
many cases the merchant would deliver to<br/>
each. And then the French Consul, in con-<br/>
cert with the Spirit Farmer, shall give to<br/>
each undertaker a written license to sell the<br/>
liquor. The licenses shall have the seals<br/>
of both the Consul and the Spirit Farmer<br/>
affixed to them, and all the cases and bot-<br/>
tles shall have the seal of the Spirit Farmer<br/>
imprinted on them so that the servants of<br/>
the Inspector of Customs shall be able to<br/>
ascertain readily what cases and bottles con-<br/>
tain French liquor, and thus avoid disputes.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ARTICLE V. Let it be distinctly under-<br/>
stood that the articles of this Treaty have<br/>
respect only to French liquors, and to no<br/>
others. And those persons who may ob-<br/>
tain licenses to sell [French liquors] shall<br/>
be careful and sure that they do not use<br/>
their licenses for the sale of any other kind<br/>
of spirits, as there are dishonest men who<br/>
might be tempted to use their licenses for<br/>
the sole of ligours that have a counterfeit<br/>
French label on the cases and bottles. Any<br/>
person of this discription, when detected,<br/>
shall be required by the French Consul, to<br/>
return his license: or if the Spirit Farmer<br/>
shall detect and arrest such a man, let him<br/>
not presume to make any complaint of it to<br/>
the French Consul for he will have no de-<br/>
sire to hear him.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ARTICLE VI. Whoever may wish to in-<br/>
form himself as to what are certainly the<br/>
lawful labels for French liquors, or what<br/>
are the counterfeits of the same, let him<br/>
hereby know that at the French Consulates<br/>
there are the several varieties of labels, and<br/>
if any one desire to go and examine them,<br/>
he is at liberty to do so.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
ARTICLE VII. These articles of Treaty<br/>
have been written both in the French and<br/>
Siamese languages, and are designed to be<br/>
used within the limits of the city of Bang-<br/>

THE RIVER TA-CHEEN
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Ta-cheen river empties into the head of<br/>
the Gulf of Siam, twenty miles or more<br/>
West of the mouth of the Maa-nam Chow<br/>
Phya, and is about one fourth less in<br/>
volume than the latter. It appears to be<br/>
sufficiently deep to be navigated more than<br/>
60 miles, by any vessel of less than twelve<br/>
feet draught. But there is a sand bar a<br/>
little outside of its mouth, much like the<br/>
one at the mouth of the Chow Phya.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
It is in some respects a more beautiful<br/>
stream than the latter, and one of the most<br/>
serpentine in Siam, its bends being gener-<br/>
ally quite abrupt, describing often almost<br/>
an entire circle. Persons not aware of this<br/>
fact, are liable to lose their reckoning and<br/>
bearings, in passing from place to place up-<br/>
on it. Some of the bends of the river,<br/>
have small sinuous canals across their<br/>
necks, which greatly shortens distances for<br/>
small craft at flood tide, but they are too<br/>
shallow for any use at ebb.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Ta-cheen is one of four noble rivers, all<br/>
flowing southerly, seeking the Gulf through<br/>
one common plain as level as the sea. This<br/>
assertion is so strange to some, that it is<br/>
difficult for them to believe it to be a fact.<br/>
A common belief of Europeans is, that<br/>
they are but so many mouths of one mighty<br/>
river. But the truth is, there is not any<br/>
evidence whatever that even any two of<br/>
them have the least natural connection with<br/>
each other.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
All this vast plain being more than 100<br/>
miles in width, from East to West, and not<br/>
less than 150 miles in length, from North<br/>
to South, was once, in all probability, oc-<br/>
cupied by the sea, which, having gradually<br/>
retired from its ancient boundaries since<br/>
Noah's flood, has left these four great riv-<br/>
ers, to cut each its own independent chan-<br/>
nel to the Gulf, through the alluvial de-<br/>
posit left by the receding waters. As a<br/>
proof that the sea has retired, it may be<br/>
stated that marine productions are to be<br/>
found deeply imbedded in all this alluvial<br/>
deposit, and that there are hills of sea shells<br/>
at Aug-hin, and other places, from 20 to 30<br/>
feet above the present level of the sea.

Obituary Notice
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Sir Robert Schomburgk.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk, lately<br/>
her Majesty's consul at Bangkok, and cel-<br/>
ebrated for his many travels and his scien-<br/>
tific investigations in South America, died<br/>
at Berlin on the 11th inst. Sir Robert was<br/>
born in 1804. His first employment was<br/>
in 1831, when he was engaged in the survey<br/>
of one of the Virgin Islands of the West<br/>
Indies, and the dangerous coral reefs<br/>
surrounding them. In 1835, under the<br/>
auspices of the Royal Geographical Society,<br/>
he proceeded to Guiana and explored its<br/>
interior, which was previously unknown<br/>
land. For this service he received the gold<br/>
medal of the society on returning to Eng<br/>
land in 1839. In the subsequent year he<br/>
undertook, on the part of the British Gov-<br/>
ernment, the survey of the limits of British<br/>
Guiana, for the successful prosecution of<br/>
which mission he received the honour of<br/>
knighthood, and in the same year (1840)<br/>
he was nominated a Knight of the Prussian<br/>
Order of the Red Eagle, and received pro-<br/>
motion in the same order some years later.<br/>
Sir Robert first entered upon the consular<br/>
service of Great Britain in 1848, when he<br/>
was appointed British Consul at St. Dom-<br/>
ingo, and in the following year was accredot-<br/>
ed plenipotentiary to conclude a treaty with<br/>
that republic. He was appointed consul at<br/>
Bangkok in 1857, but retired on a pension<br/>
last year. In 1859 accompanied by Mr.<br/>
Clark, interpreter, he proceeded on an over-<br/>
land tour to Moulmein, through Changmei,<br/>
the capital of the tributary kingdom of<br/>
Laos, and returned to the seat of his con-<br/>
sulate in 1860. Sir Robert was a member<br/>
of many learned societies both in Europe<br/>
and America, and he is the author of some<br/>
clever works and many scientific papers of<br/>
great interest. Sir Robert was a Prussian,<br/>
subject by birth. Overland Mail, Mar. 18th

{{< news/text >}}
The Steamer Chow Phya left Singapore<br/>
May 8th, arrived at the bar 13th inst, and<br/>
and at Bangkok at 11 A.M 14th inst.

{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}
On the 11th inst, the Opium farmer's<br/>
men assisted by Capt Amos and five or six<br/>
of the Police Force, searched the promises<br/>
of Messrs. Pickenpack, Theis, & Co., for<br/>
contraband Opium and found a large<br/>
quantity. It appears that there was scarcely<br/>
a chest opened but what contained opium<br/>
more or less, from one to two hundred<br/>
ticals worth;—that the coolies have<br/>
been carrying on a good business for some<br/>
time, and that the opium was prepared<br/>
on the premises, as the pans &c, used for<br/>
that purpose were also found and seized.<br/>
The opium not generally distributed plainly<br/>
showed that not one or two were alone<br/>
guilty, but the whole fraternity of coolies<br/>
including the head man, in whose chest<br/>
the largest quantity was found. The whole<br/>
forty or fifty men ought to have been<br/>
arrested; but it would have required the<br/>
whole Police Force to do that, Capt. Ames<br/>
wisely took four of the most guilty, and<br/>
with the opium was proceeding to the boat,<br/>
when the prisoners called on their friends<br/>
for assistance, and a general row com-<br/>
menced.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
About fifty or sixty coolies (among whom<br/>
were some who claimed to belong to the<br/>
"Borneo Co. Limited") against six of the<br/>
Police, who retained two of the prisoners<br/>
and all the opium; the opium farmer's men<br/>
who had chrged the other two, let them<br/>
go to the first onset and retreated to the boat.<br/>
The coolies were armed with sticks and<br/>
bricks (which they showered about pretty<br/>
plentifully) and in spite of Mr. Finch who<br/>
did all in his power to quell the disturbance,<br/>
they followed the prisoners to the boat, and<br/>
would have probably released them, had<br/>
not Mr. Finch and his friends brought fire<br/>
arms to bear on them, at which they pre-<br/>
cipitately dispersed.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We find that the practice of assaulting<br/>
the Police, and releasing prisoners is very<br/>
common among the Chinese, and not until<br/>
a severe example is made of some of them<br/>
will a stop be put to it. The Police were<br/>
only doing their duty, and without their<br/>
assistance it would be very difficult to seize<br/>
opium; therefore as long as the Government<br/>
receive a revenue from the sale of that<br/>
drug, and the opium farmer requires the<br/>
assistance of the Police to seize smugglers,<br/>
we hope that the Government will support<br/>
and protect the Police, and punish every<br/>
one who may assault or obstruct them in<br/>
the execution of their duty.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We are sorry to find that this is the<br/>
second European establishment, on which<br/>
opium in large quantities has been found<br/>
within the last few weeks, and report says<br/>
that others are suspected; most likely the<br/>
Chinamen take advantage of the premises<br/>
of Foreigners, and are under the impression<br/>
the Police will never pay them a visit.<br/>
Much to the proprietors that was done<br/>
so twice, successively, and we hope it might<br/>
be the means of breaking up such nests<br/>
of crime, and free the proprietors from a<br/>
certain amount of suspicion, which will<br/>
naturally in some minds be attached to<br/>
them.

Underground Railway in New York.—
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Another effort is made to obtain<br/>
from the Legislature of New York a charter<br/>
for a railroad under Broadway, to extend<br/>
from Bowling Green to the Central Park.<br/>
The project may receive an impulse from<br/>
the success of a similar enterprise in Lon-<br/>
don. The Metropolitan Underground Rail-<br/>
way of London reports : "One week in<br/>
December there were carried over the road<br/>
273,669 passengers, the receipts being £2,-<br/>
703. This is the largest weekly receipt<br/>
since the opening. This is equal to £720<br/>
per mile for the week, or at the rate of<br/>
£37,000 per mile per annum, and is very<br/>
largely in excess of the receipts per mile of<br/>
any other railway in the kingdom. When<br/>
the extension is open there is no doubt that<br/>
the traffic over the entire railway will be<br/>
enormously increased. The works are be-<br/>
ing vigorously prosecuted."

A steamer has arrived at Crookhaven<br/>
this morning, bringing advices from New<br/>
York to the 16th inst. General Lee re-<br/>
ports that the Federals, advancing on Kin-<br/>
ston, North Carolina, were attacked four<br/>
miles from that place by General Bragg<br/>
on the 8th inst, and driven back three miles,<br/>
with the loss of 1,500 prisoners, three can-<br/>
non, and many killed and wounded, which<br/>
were left on the field. The Confederate<br/>
loss was smail. General Schofield, who ar-<br/>
rived at the scene of operations on the fol-<br/>
lowing day, reports that Bragg renewed<br/>
the attack on the 10th, but was repulsed<br/>
with heavy loss in killed and wounded, and<br/>
several hundred were taken prisoners. He,<br/>
in turn, admits his loss small. Later des-<br/>
patches from Fortress Monroe state that<br/>
Schofield occupied Kingston on the 10th,<br/>
Braggs being retired towards Goldsborough.
{{< /news/text >}}

Mr. Stanton had announced the receipt<br/>
of despatches from Sherman dated Laurel-<br/>
hill, North Carolina, of the 8th inst, which<br/>
state that he is progressing well, but, for<br/>
prudential reasons omits giving details. A<br/>
later telegram, however, states that scouts<br/>
from Sherman arrived at Wilmington on<br/>
the 11th, and reported his army encamped<br/>
at Fayetteville, North Carolina.<br/>
    Richmond papers publish a correspon-<br/>
dence between Sherman and Wade Hamp-<br/>
ton, in which the former declared he will<br/>
shoot a Confederate soldier for every one<br/>
of his men killed while foraging; and the<br/>
latter replies, that for every Confederate so<br/>
executed he will retaliate by shooting two<br/>
Federal officals.<br/>
    General Lee notifies to the Confederate<br/>
war department that General Wade Hamp-<br/>
ton attacked General Kilpatrick, without<br/>
mentioning at what place, on the 10th, and<br/>
drove him from his encampment, capturing<br/>
his cannon, horses, trains, several hundred<br/>
prisoners, and recapturing many Confeder-<br/>
ate prisoners. The Federal loss in killed<br/>
and wounded was heavy; that of the Con-<br/>
federates slight.<br/>
    Gen. Sheridan, in a despatch to General<br/>
Grant, dated Columbia, Virginia, reports<br/>
the progress of his expedition up to the<br/>
10th inst. He alludes to a previous des-<br/>
patch, announcing his occupation of Way-<br/>
nesborough, and the defeat of Early by Cus-<br/>
ter, which had not been published. From<br/>
Waynesborough he proceeded to Charlotte-<br/>
ville, sending out detachments, which des-<br/>
troyed bridges and portions of the railways<br/>
to within twenty miles of Lynchburg, thence<br/>
to Scottsville, and destroying the locks and<br/>
cutting the banks of the James River Ca,<br/>
nal letting in the full current of the river,<br/>
and tearing up the railway along its banks.<br/>
All mills, factories and bridges on the line<br/>
of march were destroyed. Commodore<br/>
Hollins, of the Confederate navy, was re-<br/>
ported killed while attempting to escape.<br/>
capture. Sheridan adds, that he met with<br/>
no opposition after the conflict with Early,<br/>
and found food and forage in abundance.<br/>
The courier who brought Sheridan's des-<br/>
patches to Grant stated that Sheridan re-<br/>
connoitred Lynchburg, but found its gar-<br/>
rison reinforced and its defenses too strong<br/>
to attack. Sheridan was said to be endeav-<br/>
oring to reach White House on the<br/>
Pamunky.

Mobile dispatches of the 28th ult., to<br/>

upon that city was expected.

traille did not anchor opposite the Royal<br/>

was fired upon her arrival here. And when<br/>

left peaceably. What she would have done<br/>

To the Editor of the Bangkok Recorder
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
My Dear Sir—Some years ago I made<br/>
a note of the following law against "obtain-<br/>
ing husbands under false pretences," it was<br/>
passed by the English Parliament in 1770<br/>
and enacts " That all women of whatso-<br/>
ever age, whether virgins, maids, or widows,<br/>
who shall impose upon, seduce, and betray<br/>
into matrimony, any of H. Majesty's male<br/>
subjects by virtue of scents, paints, cos-<br/>
metics, washes, artificial teeth, false hair<br/>
spanish wool, iron, iron stays, bolstered<br/>
hips, or high heeled shoes, shall incur the<br/>
penalty of the law, now against witchcraft,<br/>
and like misdemeanors, and their marriage<br/>
under such circumstances, upon conviction<br/>
of the offending party, shall be null and<br/>
void."
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Do you know if this law has been repeal<br/>
ed? I am acquainted with a few bewitching<br/>
creatures, who do not pay the slightest re-<br/>
gard to the above, and although I may not<br/>
always be proof against their witchcraft, I<br/>
should be very sorry to see any of them un<br/>
dergo the penalty of the law.

If you read the following verses, and are told<br/>
that they are written by a boy fifteen years old, who<br/>
saved carefully to raise money enough to buy the pa-<br/>
per and pay the postage, then wrote the lines upon<br/>
the window-sill, and with modest hesitation and<br/>
doubt sent them off, would you not augur well of<br/>
him? But if you knew that he was of foreign blood,<br/>
his parents dead, his mother, though very poor, yet<br/>
greatly educated, and careful, before dying, of his<br/>
education; and that the verses are the remembrance<br/>
of an old legend his mother used to sing,-—will you<br/>
not feel that upon this page of the Easy Chair you<br/>
have fallen upon one of those chapters of romance<br/>
which are familiar to us in Miss Braddon’s books,<br/>
say—and in older and better books than hers—and<br/>
in the best history of human life? It is remarkable<br/>
to find the rhythm and the tone of the oldest En-<br/>
glish poetry in these verses of a half-American lad<br/>
of to-day. There is a suggestion in the measure<br/>
and phraseology of the pompous richness and stiff<br/>
brocaded movement of old English verse. Imag-<br/>
ine that the Easy Chair copies from some page of<br/>
two or three centuries ago, and it will not seem<br/>
strange. "Easy Chair Harper's Monthly".

{{< news/indent1 >}}{{< news/indent1 >}}Grasps his keen rays and flies to the Eastern clime.<br/>
{{< news/indent1 >}}<br/>
{{< news/indent1 >}}He gained the Horizon! — When poor Night beheld<br/>

{{< news/indent1 >}}{{< news/indent1 >}}T'escape the fury of her swift pursuer.<br/>
{{< news/indent1 >}}<br/>
{{< news/indent1 >}}From side to side disconsolate she flies,<br/>

{{< news/indent1 >}}{{< news/indent1 >}}And creeps for shelter, trembling as she goes.<br/>

{{< news/indent1 >}}In close pursuit the Sun the welkin treads,<br/>

{{< news/indent1 >}}{{< news/indent1 >}}To find what den the fugitive might hide.<br/>
{{< news/indent1 >}}<br/>

{{< news/indent1 >}}Soon as he passed from coward terrors free<br/>

Odds and Ends.

{{< news/text >}}
Four gentlemen—a Baptist, Presbyterian,<br/>
Methodist, and Roman Catholic—met by<br/>
agreement to dine on a fish. Soon as grace<br/>
was said, the Catholic rose, armed with a<br/>
knife and fork, and taking about one-third<br/>
of the fish, comprehending the head, re-<br/>
moved it to his plate, exclaiming, as he sat<br/>
down, with great self-satisfaction, "Papa<br/>
est caput ecclesiæ:" the Pope is the head<br/>
of the church. Immediately the Methodist<br/>
minister arose, and, helping himself to about<br/>
one-third, embracing the tail, seated him-<br/>
self. "Finis coronat opus;" the end crowns<br/>
the work. The Presbyterian now thought<br/>
it was about time for him to move, and,<br/>
taking the remainder of the fish to his plate,<br/>
exclaimed, "In mediis est veritas;" truth lies<br/>
between the two extremes. Our Baptist<br/>
brother had nothing before him but an<br/>
empty plate, and the prospect of a slim<br/>
dinner; and, snatching up the bowl of<br/>
drawn [melted] butter, he dashed it over<br/>
them all, exclaiming, "Ego baptiso vos;" I<br/>
baptize you all.

The London Spectator concludes a late article on<br/>
Gen. Sherman’s march, written on receipt of Americ-<br/>
can news now four weeks old, with the emphatic<br/>
(now prophetic) declaration: — "There is not a<br/>
general now alive in Europe who, if Sherman suc-<br/>
ceeds, will not recognize the addition of one more<br/>
to the short but first-class leaders of armies."

Steeling Money.—The following extract from<br/>
Camden will explain the origin and use of the word<br/>
"sterling."—"In the time of King Richard I, monie<br/>
coined in the east parts of Germanie begun to be of<br/>
especiall request in England for the puritie thereof,<br/>
and was called Easterling monie, as all the inhabit-<br/>
ants of those parts were called Easterlings, and<br/>
shortly after some of that countrie, skillful in mint<br/>
matters and alloes, were sent for into the realme to<br/>
bring the coins to perfection, which since that time<br/>
were called of them sterling, for Easterling."

The Wealthiest Man—-An Annual Income of<br/>
$5,000,000.—Alexander T. Stewart, the dry goods<br/>
nabob of New York, has the largest income of any<br/>
man in America, or (probably) the world. He has<br/>
lately paid an income tax of $250,000—on a net in-<br/>
come of five million dollars!—This would be the in-<br/>
terest, at 6 per cent, of over eighty millions. We<br/>
know of no case among the wealthy men of England<br/>
that surpasses or equals this, and we suppose A. T.<br/>
Stewart is the “richest man” living—Albany Argus.

A lady's age—A lady who still prides herself on<br/>
her youth and beauty had to appear at a Paris police-<br/>
court last week. She had differences with her son,<br/>
who is old enough at least to be examined on oath.<br/>
They both had to state their age in a court of Just-<br/>
ice. "Your age, madame?" asks the courteous<br/>
justice. "Twenty-five," says audacious mother. A<br/>
little later the son is in the box. "Your age, sir?"<br/>
asks justice. "Why" answers ingenious youth,<br/>
"I had, to my astonishment, that I am a year older<br/>
than my mother."

"You labor overmuch in your composition, doc-<br/>

A lady that would please herself in marrying was<br/>
warned that her intended, although a very good sort<br/>
of a man, was very singular. "Well," replied the<br/>
lady, "if he is very much unlike other men he is<br/>
much more likely to make a good husband."<br/>
A woman having occasion to visit an acquaintance<br/>
living in a neighboring town, took her seat in a<br/>

which the journey was accomplished, she remarked,<br/>
that if she had known she could have got there so<br/>
quickly, she would have walked.

Archbishop Whateby was endeavoring to elicit a<br/>
candidate's idea on the market value of labor, with<br/>
reference to demand and supply, but being puzzled,<br/>
the prelate put a question in this simple form—"If<br/>
there are in your village two shoemakers with just<br/>
sufficient employment to enable them to live a tolera-<br/>
bly and no more, what would follow if a third shoe-<br/>
maker set up in the same village?" "What would<br/>
follow, sir?" said the candidate; "why, a fight, to<br/>
be sure!"

applied to a respectable lawyer for legal advice. Af-<br/>
ter detailing the circumstances of the case, he was<br/>

A man applied to Dr. Jackson, the celebrated<br/>

sir, that is iron pyrites." "What sir?" in a voice of<br/>
thunder. "Iron pyrites." Iron pyrites! and what<br/>
is that?" "That's what it is," said the chemist, put-<br/>
ting a lot on the shovel over the hot coals, where it<br/>

I've married her!""
