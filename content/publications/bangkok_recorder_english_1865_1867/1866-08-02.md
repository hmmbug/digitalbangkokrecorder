Summary.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}FRANCE.-—A letter written by the Em-
peror to his Foreign Minister, in refer-
ence to the proposed Congress and the
German conflict, has been read to the
Corps Legislatif. It is pretty clearly in-
timated that, in case of the "map of
Europe being modified," France will
look to have the Rhenish provinces-—al-
ways supposing, of course, that they
demand annexation "by votes freely ex-
pressed." A correspondent states that
France is prepared to put 600,000 men
in the field in a fortnight. Precautions
are being taken against cholera.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE GERMAN STATES.—-The Federal
Diet adopted the Austrian motion for
mobilizing the Federal army by nine
votes to six, the larger States being all
in favour of it. The Prussian represen-
tative declared the Federal pact to be
dissolved, and withdrew from the assem-
bly. The States who assented have been
warned that Prussia will consider their
votes equivalent to a declaration of war.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}RUSSIA.-—News has been received of a
complete victory gained over the Emir
of Bokhara on the 8th May by General
Romanowsky. The Czarewitch arrived
at Copenhagen on the 13th.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.—-A body of

Erie. The Canadian Volunteers were

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
British North America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The steamer that left New York on
the 2nd instant brought intelligence that
a body of Fenians, under Colonel O'Neill,
variously estimated at from 500 to 2,000
strong, crossed Niagara river on the night
of the 29th May, and took possession of
Fort Erie, a small and undefended village,
three miles from Buffalo, and threw up
breastworks to await reinforcements.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have since had advices direct from
Quebec to the same date, which state
that on receipt of the intelligence two
volunteer infantry corps left Montreal to
meet the enemy, and the following des
patch was put on board the steamer when
off Panther Point:—"The volunteers af
ter attacking the enemy this morning
(June 2) near Ridgway were compelled
to retire, being outnumbered. Colonel
Peacock, in the meantime, had moved
his force (regulars) to a point between
the enemy and the river. He then eng
aged them at the point of the bayonet,
and all who reached the river took to
the boats, but the United States author
ities would not allow them to land on
the United States frontier, and it is be
lieved that most of them have surrender
ed to our forces: The Fenians are con
centrating at Malone and St. Alban's,
but ample preparations have been made
to deal with them should they cross the
border. The greatest enthusiasm pre
vails amongst our volunteers, who are
hourly going to the front.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another account is—Fenians defeated,
and surrounded by 16th and 47th Re
giments and volunteers. It is stated that
O'Neill, the Fenian leader, had been shot.
It is reported that 37 men and three
officers of the Toronto 10th Royals were
killed in the action in which the Fenians
were defeated. The Fenians fought
desperately. One thousand men, under
Colonel Lowry, left Toronto to-day
(the 2nd). The volunteers are pouring
in from the country. Medical men have
gone from Montreal to the scene of
action.{{< /news/text >}}

The Straits' Transfer.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In confirmation of the statement made
in our last, we now have to announce that
the Bill was read a first time on the 13th
inst. We give the following extract
from a Treasury letter, dated 2nd June:
—“In order to avoid further delay, my
lords considered it best that the fixed con-
tribution of £56,500 a year should be
adopted for the first five years; and, on
this understanding, they assent to the in-
troduction of the Bill into Parliament for
the transfer of these Settlements. As
regards that portion of your letter which
refers to barrack accommodation for any
troops stationed in the Settlements for
Imperial purposes, my lords agree that
no charge, on this account, ought to fall
upon the Settlements. The only condi-
tion they have to make upon the subject
is, that after sufficient barrack and hos-
pital accommodation has been provided
at the expense of the Settlements for
the troops stationed there for local pur-
poses, any existing barracks or hospitals
which may be in excess of such accommo-
dation, and which may be required by
the War Department, shall be handed
over to that department free of any
charge, to be maintained at the Imperial
expense during their occupation thereof.
As regards the public debt of the Settle-
ments, my lords conclude that the arran-
gement with the Indian Government, as
explained in the Colonial Office letter of
the 24th March, 1865, is to be carried
out; that, as regards the convict expen-
diture, the whole of it from the date of
transfer will be repaid by the Indian
Government and that the notice for the
removal of the penal establishment with-
in three years of the date of such notice
will be given not later than the date of
transfer, which should take place, as
recommended in the 66th paragraph of
Sir Hercules Robinson's Report upon the
Settlements, at the close of the colonial
financial year, viz., 31st December 1866
or 1867, according as the necessary ar-
rangements can be completed. As re-
gards the civil establishment to be sanc-
tioned for the Settlements, my lords will
be prepared to approve of an establish-
ment on the basis of that suggested by
Sir H. Robinson, in Enclosure No. 9 of
his report, subject to such modification
as experience may have since dictated, or
which any change as regards the muni-
cipalities of the Settlements may here-
after render necessary.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}FIVE BATTLES in one week, and
Austria victorious in the three most im-
tant—-such is the news brought by
telegraph so far as it is intelligible.
The first conflict is telegraphed on 19th
June, when Prussia attacked the Darm-
stadt Hessians who held the federal
capital of Frankfort, and nearly anni-
hilated a regiment. One-third of the
people of Hesse Darmstadt are Roman
Catholics and the rest Lutherans or
Calvinists. Thus at the outset a Prot-
estant German Army, the head of
which is the husband of our Princess
Royal, slaughtered the Protestant Ger-
man troops of a family into which our
Princess Alice is married. Advancing
on the west into Bohemia the Pruss-
ians have been twice beaten, once at
Neustadt on the 26th, and again on
the 28th, with great loss. Besides
this on the east, they were checked
in invading Galicia. In the south,
the Italians' ardent patriotism seem to
have thrown them on the Quadrilateral
at Verona to meet only the defeat
so disheartening that they retreated
not only the Mineio but the Po. Wheth-
er Garibaldi repulsed the Austrians
in the Tyrol, as is probable, or was
repulsed as another telegram says, re-
mains to be seen. Meanwhile Aus-
tria is master of the situation. Russia
has abstained from threatening her Pol-
ish frontier, the war is as popular
with the many races who are her sub-
jects as it is detested by Prussia, and
that Hungarian sprung from the peo-
ple, Field Marshal Benedek, has not
yet met his rival. If Austria pushes
her victories, as she seems inclined to
do by refusing an armistice after the
second great battle, Prussia will rise
as one man, Italy will only be fired
by her defeat, and a long and bloody
contest seems certain.—-FRIEND of
INDIA.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}LORD DERBY, by the last news, had
not formed a ministry or done more than
assign to his son the Foreign Office, with
the leadership of the House of Commons
of course, and he will have such great
difficulty in getting men from the Con-
servative ranks that he may be driven to
a Coalition. In that case the Third Party
will get scope for their ability, and noth-
ing is less improbable than that Mr. La-
ing's services should be made available in
the Indian Office. He is less a Liberal
than Lord Stanley, and there is no room
for his financial abilities in a ministry
which long ago fixed on Sir Stafford
Northcote for its Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer. The mention of Lord Stanley
in connexion with the Foreign Office, in-
volves the elevation of Mr. Disraeli to the
Lords, with a nominal office or the French
Embassy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE FAMINE, continues its severity in
Orissa, but the copious rain makes it pro-
bable that the scarcity will soon disappear
elsewhere. For Orissa Government has
advanced £40,000 as capital for the pur-
chase and sale of rice, which, now that the
high prices have failed to bring much of
the supposed hidden store into the mar-
ket, ought to be sold at a cheaper rate
than 5 seers a rupee.—-FRIEND of INDIA.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}ACCORDING TO A RUSSIAN JOURNAL.
THE object of Russia in extending her
conquests in Central Asia to the fron-
tiers of India, is to compel England
to remain neutral in the war which
Russia intends sooner or later to wage
against Turkey.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Russia does not care to command
the road to India with any ambitious
idea of wresting their possessions from
the English for the mere sake of con-
quest. She will only keep this as a
reserved argument to force the British
to retire from the Council Chamber
of the Sultan; and if she cannot per-
suade them to join her in the Holy
War, she can at least insist on their
remaining passive in the struggle.—-

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
American Beneficence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The beneficence that flowed from the
American heart during the war of the Re-
bellion, was not a spasmodic effort, produ-
ced by the sudden scenes of suffering and
bloodshed. There was a charitable prin-
ciple underlying exterior life, which took
shape in educational plans and various
other objects. A large number of Ameri-
can colleges and theological seminaries
have received princely donations within
the last two years, when it would be natu-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}rally supposed that every purse would be
emptied to keep the wolf from the door.
The application of treasure during the
rebellion for other objects than those in-
cident to the war, was of such magnitude
and spontaneous growth, that its equal can-
not be found in history. During the last
two years Bowdoin college has received an
endowment of $72,000; Dartmouth of $47,
000; Middlebury, $10,000; Williams, $25,
000; Amherst, over $100,000; Trinity, $100,
000; Yale, $450,000; Hamilton, over $100,
000; Rutgers, $130,000; Princeton, $130,
000; Andover, Theological Seminary, $70,
000; New-York University, $60,000; Au-
burn Theological Seminary at Chicago,
$80,000; besides various other donations of
scarcely less amount. Denominational be-
neficence has not been contracted by the
war; on the contrary it seems to have gain-
ed greater power. As an evidence of it, the
Methodist Episcopal Church, which this
year celebrates its centennial jubilee, pro-
poses to raise an extraordinary fund of two
million of dollars, one-fourth of which has
already been pledged by one man—Daniel
Drew of New York. The probability is
that the close of the centenary year will
find the Methodist treasury containing
nearly three millions than two millions of
dollars.—Lo, Co, News.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The True Standard of Dress.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are always excessive when we sacri-
fice the higher beauty to attain the lower
one. A woman who will sacrifice domes-
tic affection, conscience, self-respect, honor,
to love of dress, we all agree, loves dress
too much. She loses the true and higher
beauty of womanhood for the lower beauty
of gems and flowers and colors. A girl
who sacrifices to dress all her time all her
strength, all her money, to the neglect of
the claims of others on her helpfulness, is
sacrificing the higher to the lower beauty.
Her fault is not the love of beauty, but lov-
ing the wrong and inferior kind.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In fine, girls, you may try yourselves by
this standard. You love dress too much
when you care more for you outward ador-
nings than for your inward dispositions,
when it afflicts you more to have torn your
dress than to have lost your tempers, when
you are more troubled by an ill-fitting gown
than by a neglected duty,—when you are
less concerned at having made an unjust
comment, or spread a scandalous report,
than at having worn a PAGAN bonner,—
when you are less troubled at the thought
of being found at the last great feast with-
out the wedding garment, than at being
found at the party to-night in the fashion
of last year. No Christian woman, as I
view it, ought to give such attention to her
dress as to allow it to take up ALL of three
very important things, viz: ALL her time,
ALL her strength, ALL her money. Who-
ever does this lives not the Christian, but
the Pagan life,—worships not at the Chris-
tian's altar of our Lord Jesus, but at the
shrine of the lower Venus of Corinth and
Rome. Mrs. STOWE.{{< /news/text >}}

Colored People in Boston.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Boston Journal says the colored
population of that city numbers between
2,500 and 3,000, and are generally speak-
ing, an industrious, intelligent, frugal
and quietly disposed class of people—
much more so than they have credit for.
There are among them a large number
of mechanics; most of them, however,
are laboring men. A large number are
quite wealthy, owning property averaging
from $500 to $50,000.—-They support
five churches—-three Methodist and two
Baptist—-four of which are upheld en-
tirely by themselves, and one has been
assisted somewhat by contributions out-
side of their own organization. It is
much to their credit that there are but
few paupers among them. As a class,
with the disadvantage of a deep-seated,
though fast disappearing prejudice a-
gainst them, they have certainly won for
themselves the respect of the community
in which they live. Their children at-
tend our public schools, and have equal
privileges with the children of their white
neighbors, and several of them have been
recipients at different times of the Fram-
klin and City Medals for good scholarship.{{< /news/text >}}

The European war
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our latest telegram of July 5th
looks somewhat like a morning star
of hope of a pleasant day after a dark
night of terrible storm. But we have
had of late so many false stars that
have been suddenly blotted out as
morp meteors, that we cannot but feel
somewhat distrustful of this sign of
the times. Still we will hope, though
it be with trembling, that the myriad
of swords that had leaped from their
scabbards have all returned to their
quiet homes, and that all the mightily
empowered engines of war, hurling thou-
sands into eternity, have been hushed
to peace. One thing appear to as
pretty certain, and that is, that Prussia
has lost her arrogant prestige and will
no more be feared by her German
neighbors as she has been. And
another seems quite probable, which
is that all the German states, it may be
with Prussia herself included, are now
about forming a great Republic or a
limited Monarchy that shall have
strength and stability enough to bo-
come second to no other power in
preserving the peace of Europe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Those many petty independent
States, having among them more than
a dozen crowned heads, are necessari-
ly composed of too inflammable ma-
terials to allow any rational hope of
peace among themselves while consti-
tuted as they hitherto have been. We
will frankly say, that we fervently hope
to hear that negociations are in pro-
gress for the thorough remodelling of
those States and for their ultimate co-
alescence into one grand gov-
ernment for developing the principles
of liberty and freedom in concert with
the spirit of the age in which we live,
and thus become a powerful central
bulwark of Europe.{{< /news/text >}}

Petchaburee No. 5.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As promised in our last issue, we
come now to have another pleasant
interview with our readers on the top
of P'rá Nákwun-kiree the sacred city
on a mount. This name has been
given to it since the royal palace on
its summit was erected. Prior to this
it was denominated Maha Sawan; lit-
erally the great heaven. Why it ever
received such a name we cannot tell.
There is nothing in its size, certainly,
that would render it appropriate; for
it is scarcely 400 feet high, and pro-
bably less than two miles in circum-
ference at its lowest base. You will
observe that its length is in the direc-
tion of N. W. and S. E. and that it
has 3 prinicipal peaks about of equal
hight. The one at the S. E. extremity
is honored with the distinguishing name
SOW P'RÁ NAWN—-mount of a loung-
ing god, because at its foot is a temple in
which is enshrined an immense image
of Buddh in a reclining posture. The
peak most western is the site of His
Majesty's mountain palace. The
middle peak has been set apart for a
large pagoda the foundation of which
has been laid and carried up 8 or 10
feet. There are several peaks, all oc-
cupied by various brick works inten-
ded to add beauty and dignity to the
palace as satellites.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The shrubbery on the mount is now
so thick and its foliage so dense as al-
most to hide entirely all the craggy
rocks of which the mount is mainly
composed. We once, about 7 years
since, had a view of those rocks when
the mount had but recently been
cleared of most of its primitive shrub-
bery for the purpose of preparing it
for the royal palace. We could not
but mourn over the desolation which
the work, then but commencing, made
over the wild magnificence of nature.
But now a new growth of shrubbery
has sprung up with a good degree of
the original wildness, bearing a foliage
the most luxuriant and beautiful.
When you look closely among them
and see the great predominance of
lime stone rocks, lying edgewise in the
greatest disorder, with their myriads of
crags and spires, you can but wonder
how the vegetation can find soil en-
ough to flourish as it does. But the
truth is, the climate of Siam is no won-
derfully favorable to vegetable life that
many shrubs, and even trees of con-
siderable size, will grow with scarcely
a sprinkling of soil. The pad tree, for
example, will commence life on the
naked walls of a brick house more
than 30 feet from the ground, shoot-
ing its roots down the sides of the
wall, entering into every crevice, until
they reach the ground, and then throw
the building down by their growth
among the cracks. Hence it becomes
necessary that a strict watch always
be kept of the seedlings of the poâ
that they be extirpated from walls
and roofs of buildings ere it becomes
impossible to eradicate them without
destroying the building on which they
have taken root. Of such air plants,
as we may call them, there are many
kinds in Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Wherever there is any vacancy of
shrubbery on the mount there the wild
lady slipper occupies, and the pink
and purple and white four o’clocks and
morning glories and many other flow-
ering annuals furnish a pleasing va-
riety. The lan tom, mentioned in a
preceding article, abounds and ever im-
parts by her yellowish white cup flowers
a very pleasant fragrance to the air.
—The prickly pear of many varieties
is perfectly at home here. One of the
species becomes a tree from 15 to 20
feet high with a trunk from 6 to 10 in-
ches in diameter. The old trees that
had become large were mostly cut down
years ago, and consequently the new
growth is now comparatively small.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We cannot attempt a minute de-
scription of any of the thirty or more
buildings on the mount, much less
of the palace itself into which we have
never entered. This is not a large
building as one might anticipate. It is
we should judge not far from 80 by
40 feet exclusive of the many attach-
ments to it. To form a foundation
sufficiently ample for it, walls wery built
up by the sides of the cliff from 20 to
50 feet with broken lime stone blasted
from the rocks, and laid roughly to-
gether like a common stone fence, and
then the crevices all filled with lime
mortar. The walls of the palace are
two stories high built of brick, finished
externally with white stucco, and neatly
polished. The roof of the palace is
covered with earthen tiles imported
from China, which form narrow furrows
and ridges from eve to ridge. The win-
dows, as usual in Siam, have no glass,
being closed by wooden shutters. In or-
der to reach the basement story you
have to ascend two flights of stone steps
30 or 40 feet long with a heavy railing of
white stucco work with green earthen
balusters or rounds. We have the im-
pression that while the internal aspect
of the palace must comport with the
good taste of what we see of it exter-
nally, it will not nearly equal the rich-
ness and magnificence of the royal
palace at the capital; and the rooms
must necessarily, be much less capa-
cious, being designed for His Majes-
ty's accomodation only a dozen days
in a year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A theatre, which is always an indis-
pensable accompaniment of a royal
palace was early built on the mount,
situated a little down the cliff at the
N. West end of the palace. It was
burnt down two years ago by a balloon
falling on its attap roof while His Ma-
jesty was holding holidays, on the
mount. It is now nearly rebuilt.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the S. E. end of the palace, on the
highest part of that peak, you will ob-
serve and admire a small brick structure
called Mon-Top. It is a kind of pago-
da, perhaps 30 feet high exclusive of
its spire, having four small wings with
their gable ends looking to the four
cardinal points of the compass. The
general form of the Mon-Top is like
that of the royal funeral canopy for
kings. At each of the four angles of
the pagoda there is a tasty light house
15 feet high, covered with a glass dome.
All this work is neatly finished with
white stucco and adorned with tasty
mouldings of the same material.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In close proximity with the Mon-
Top at the S. E. you will see a Budd-
hist brick Chapel not less than 80 by
40 feet and 13 or 14 feet from its tiled
floor to the ceiling. This is also neatly
finished externally with stucco and pa-
pered internally both walls and ceiling
with European paper. At one end of
the hall is a semi-circular platform of
imitation marble on which we suppose
the officiating priest sits in a chair when
he reads the Buddhist homilies. The
hall seems to be admirably adapted for
speaking, the slightest voice being con-
veyed distinctly from end to end.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As you pass out of the S. E. end of
the Chapel you come immediately to the
chief light house and observatory which
stands on 8 brick pillars with four
most graceful arches, and is finished
like all the buildings previously men-
tioned. You ascend into the upper
story by spiral steps with an iron rail-
ing. It is probably 20 feet high and
covered with a glass dome.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Looking to the S. E. over a valley
you will notice a very conspicuous
pagoda on the K'óse-p'ra-no[?]en peak,
and a foot path brick-flagged with a
white stucco balustrade and earthen
rounds on the lower side of it all the
way. The basement story of the pa-
goda is of brick and the superstructure
of granite. The pieces of which it is
composed are some of them very large,
which must have required more than
ordinary skill to have lifted up 400
feet, and fitted them so accurately in
their places; for they were brought
from the other side of the gulf, we think,
or from China already shaped, so that,
probably, no hammer had to be used in
adjusting them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But time would fail us to speak thus
particularly of the many other brick
and stuccoed buildings on the mount.
Some of them are salas, some little
forts forming entire circles with white
embrasures, some barracks for the
king's body guard, some for the accom-
modation of his numerous retinue etc.
Down in a deep valley on the north side
there is a new temple made in good
keeping with the taste of the other
buildings on the mount. In another
direction on the south side there are
some quite interesting caves with an
entrance by what has every appearance
of having been the mouth of a volcanic
crater. These of course have all been
consecrated to Buddhism and are full
of idols. There are other caverns in
the vicinity of the temple of some re-
pute among Buddhists. But Mount
Nakawn Kiree is not now and never
was famous for its caverns. Her sister
mounts Kadei-it, and Kow Lóóang
far excel her in this regard, and may
claim our notice at some future time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Would that we could accompany
this very imperfect description of the
palace mount by some of the beautiful
pictures which last Dec. we saw J.
Thomson Esq. the photographer take
from many stand points. Then could we
hope that our dull account of its scenery
would be read with lively interest.
We have yet much to say of Petscha-
buree in regard to the city, the agri-
culture of the country, and the people,
which, if the Lord will, we may give
in future articles.{{< /news/text >}}

Peace in Siam.

{{< news/text >}}As yet Siam appears to be enjoying
peace with herself, and with all na-

But this phenomena serves only to
keep our atmosphere from stagnation.
We have heard quite recently some
blustering threats of an interruption of
peace. But we think it will prove to
be only a mere vomiting of bile, which
symptoms, in our humble opinion, are
most successfully treated by a stomach
full of luke warm water, and with no

{{< news/text >}}MOST STARTLING NEWS has seldom reach-
ed India than that of the dissolution of the
Russel-Gladstone ministry and at the same
time the rapid spread of war over Central
and Southern Europe, following close on
the most serious commercial panic ever
experienced and not yet at an end. The
war we have considered elsewhere. The
Ministry were defeated by 14 votes on the
question whether the borough franchise
should be based on the ratable or rent
value of houses, by the adoption of the
former which the Opposition succeeded
in raising the franchise to £8. As
the County Franchise Bill had passed, and
the redistribution of seats on the Scotch
principle of grouping was so fair, we can-
not understand why Earl Russel has not
dissolved Parliament and appealed to the
country. Nothing could be more unfor-
tunate than this ministerial crisis—-for
England, because she will be unable to
take her proper position during what
threatens to be the greatest war Europe
has seen since 1814;—-for India because
all Indian questions will now be post-
poned and the India House will be de-
prived of Lord de Grey and Mr. Stans-
feld who protested well.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE Government of India appears to
have given the most serious consideration
to the construction of irrigation works
in all parts of India on an efficient scale.
With a glimmering of statesman-ship so
rarely in these days, the dispatch
expresses an aspiration that this “develop-
ment” will be no less successful and no
less worthy of an enlightened Government
than that made in respect to the means
of communication by the adoption of the
policy originated by Lord Dalhousie for
the construction of Railways."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—THE ENGLISHMAN says that the sick
and starving are now pouring into Cal-
cutta in such that Government has sanc-
tioned the immediate formation of a tem-
porary hospital in the Chappole Road, and
the natives are offering subscriptions.
THE HURKORA learns that Dr. Francis
has requested the Bengal Government
to sanction the establishment of a hospi-
tal in Amherst Street for the treatment
of destitute natives attacked with cholera
and dysentery, for such cases are daily in-
creasing and seriously overcrowding the
Medical College Hospital.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—THE POSTS, according to the LEVANT
HERALD, is most active in military pre-
parations. The intended introduction of
a rule granting long furloughs has been
put off till next year. The whole of the
regiments are to be raised to their full
nominal strength, for which purpose the
enrolled conscripts of 1863 and 1864 have
been summoned to the depots and in ad-
dition 12,000 orders of the 1st and 2nd
corps d’armee have been called out. An-
other great fire has happened in Constan-
tinople and burned down exactly the mass
of buildings spared by the great fire of
September last. This site was necessary
for the complete carrying out of the
scheme of reconstruction, which will
change the whole face of the capital be-
tween the Ports and the Golden Horn.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—THE AMERICAN portion of the Over-
land Russian telegraph is being pushed
on so vigorously that communication is
now complete between Washington city
and Victoria, Vancouver, a distance of
7500 miles. On April 25 congratulatory
messages were exchanged between the au-
thorities of the two cities. About 24
hours were required for the transmission
of the message and the return of the an-
swer.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—THE HEAT has been so severe at Ma-
drass as to kill the flying foxes in large
numbers. During the day they drop dead
from the trees, and are greedily seized by
the people of the lower castes and bur-
ried.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—THE SINDIAN asserts that a fleet of
steamers is now in the course of construc-
tion to ply direct between Kurrachee, A-
den and Suez. The trips will be bi-month-
ly, and it is expected the vessels will be
ready about January next. Kurrachee
is two days nearer Aden than Bombay is,
and the new steamers will take the Punjab
passenger traffic. But till Mooltan and
Kotree are connected by rail the rest of
Northern India will take the Bombay
route.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}HUMAN FOOD.-—A letter from Berlin
states that great success has attended the
introduction of horse-flesh in that capital
as an article of human food. The meat
is perfectly wholesome, and very palata-
bly palatable, resembling boiled coarse
beef. Grand dinners have been given by
a society interested in its introduction,
at which horse-flesh alone was produced,
though prepared in various ways.{{< /news/text >}}

Austria.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So the word of command will soon
be, march on to the slaughter—-sound
the trumpet of war—wives and mothers
prepare your mourning-—all for the
greater glory of Bismarck the usurper.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But let the good be comforted, there
is a justice superior to that of man,
the crimes of the Prussian government
will not remain unpunished.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}CLEVERNESS OF AUSTRIA.-—The a-
bility shown by Austria in the present
situation has been very great; it has
shown infinite patience and art in its
tactics as you will see, it has succeeded
in gaining over all the German Con-
federation and in forcing the cabinet
of the Tuileries to assume a reserved
and almost friendly attitude—-all this
Austria has done, within 15 days.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I think I need not recall to your me-
mory that on the 1st inst., Austria gave
up all its rights in the Duchy of Hol-
stein in favor of the German Bund at
Frankfort-on-the-Main and that it had
further convoked the Estates of Hol-
stein at Itzehoe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prussia, on learning this move of her
friendly enemy, declared that the trea-
ties of Gastein and Olmütz were there-
by violated, and General Manteuffel ar-
rived the order to oppose the meeting
of the Holstein Estates at Itzehoe
even by force if necessary.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was thought that violence would
be the Causa belli. An Austrian bri-
gade commanded by General Von
Gablens was in possession of Altona
and Itzehoe, the question was would
he allow the Prussians to turn him
out without a shot.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 11th of June the Prussians
entered Itzehoe, arrested the Austrian
commissioner Larner, sent the depu-
ties to the right about and the Austrian
troops made good their escape, how-
ever, their trunks and police china were
left behind, and were confiscated. What
is of all this? Austria, who had
been so clever, had prepared for what
was to occur, by telling her soldiers that
they would be of no use, they
might pick up their trunks and follow
him out of the country as he should
return home by way of Hanover. On the 12th
there was not a Kaiserlich white coat
in the Duchies. As the game of Aus-
tria was to screen himself behind the
Bund his tactic was a wise one, it is
telling, and Prussia will therefore be
obliged to face not only the Austrian
army which is formidable, but Bava-
ria, Saxony, Hanover and all the Sec-
ondary states who well know that Vic-
tory for Bismarck will be the usurpa-
tion of all Germany by Bismarck.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}POSITION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERN-
MENT,-—which was really excellent two
months ago, is now considerably chang-
ed. Not only is public opinion in Eu-
rope against Count Bismarck; but he
will not even be able to reckon on the
Prussians. The democratic party which
a few months ago committed the fault
of backing the violent policy of the
haughty premier has now found out its
mistake. Hundreds of petitions have
been sent to the King praying he will
maintain peace. Everyday the troops
are called out to repress the mobs
which clamour for work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is certain that the Kammer (or
Chamber of Deputies) which is short-
ly to be elected is still more hostile
than the proceeding one to the policy
of Bismarck, and we should never be
surprised to hear that a revolution has
taken place in Berlin, and that both
the premier and all the pack of Ho-
henzollerns have been sent to the
right about. It cannot be doubted
that when the first shot has been fired
German patriotism will show itself in
all its glory-—but—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}WHAT WILL FRANCE DO?—-To this
question which has been in every bo-
dy's mouth for the last six weeks an
answer was given on the 12th Inst. by
the Sphinx of the Tuileries by a dic-
tatory written to the minister of State
M. Rouher and which was read in
the Corps Legislatif or legislative bo-
dy—to cheers of applause.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE IMPERIAL MESSAGE—-is as appel-
[.......] is in many binding injunctions to the

as long as the balance of power in Eu-
rope should remain unbroken." The
message of the Emperor, which our pa-
pers will bring you in extenso, though
of a pacific character, does not promise
that France will not enter the lists
should the work begun in Italy be in
any way interrupted, the imperial
speech may be called pacifico bellico-
—as we say in France ni'eclair, ni'-
poisson, moitie fique, moitie raison.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THe CoRPS LEGISLATIVE—(as I said
before) received the Imperial message
with much applause and was disinclined
to have the present question debated,
therefore both Mons. Favre a rank an-
-Imperialist and even Mons. Thiers
were coughed down, when they tried
to say a few words about the matters
most interesting to the country at the
present moment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}WAR POPULAR IN AUSTRIA AND ITA-
LY.—-A war which is feared in Prus-
sia, France and England, is however
hailed with delight in Austria and It-
aly. In Vienna vengeance to Prussia
is vowed from the Palace to the Ho-
tel. In Florence the cry is morte ai
Federachi death to the Germana—the
Italians are prepared to make every sac-
rifice to get rid of the "stranger and
the Priest." The revolutionary party and
the Bourbons are taking advantage of
the movement to raise their heads.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Italian government is taking the
most vigorous measures to crush the
partisan of the fallen house, and almost
calls the reign of terror in "France,"
the dungeons are full of prisoners and

turned into prisons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After many hesitations Garibaldi
has left the island of Caprera—he is at

Telegraph extension to Siam
AND SINGAPORE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The public of British Burmah will
learn with sincere satisfaction, that His
Majesty the King of Siam, as announ-
ced in the ‘Bangkok Recorder’ of the
26th April, has just granted a conces-
sion to W. H. Read, Esquire, Honor-
ary Magistrate of Singapore for the
construction of a line of Telegraph
through Siamese territory down the
coast to Singapore.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Repeatedly has this interesting sub-
ject been referred to in our columns.
Every body may take it for granted
that the Siamese Government will give
their entire support to any just and
rational plan, for connecting Siam with
Burmah, India and Europe. This
sanction now given to run the line
down through Siamese territory to
Singapore from Rangoon is in keeping
with the well known liberal character
of the present sovereign of that king-
dom. He will not enter upon hazar-
dous speculations. He will not grant
concessions, which he may not be able
to perform. In short, he will engage
to do only those things, which he
knows he can do. He will not promise
to stand sentry over the line wherever
it may be put down. Nor will be
promise to make it good in case of its
getting injured from any accident
whatever.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He will give permission to any Tele-
graph Company to carry out their plans
in his territory; and they have the same
protection for their property, as every
other subject of His Majesty. It is
absurd to ask for anything more. More-
over it is very possible that the King
may subscribe for a number of shares,
and require certain guarantees for the
use of the line when wanted for public
purposes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There can be no question, that if a
line is constructed from Maulmain pas-
sing down through the Seaport of
Amherst, the large Burmese town of
Yes, the town of Tavoy and the town
of Mergui in British Burmah, it will
help to swell the future dividends of
the Shareholders. From Tavoy a line
of eighty miles will reach Bangkok the
capital of Siam. If it is intended to
carry the wire down to the eastern side
of the Malay peninsula, instead of the
west, the advantages of that route may
be more acceptable to the Siamese
government and the general utility of
the line than by the western route.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}About twelve months ago, a gentle-
man visited Rangoon, who had been
deputed by the King of Siam to travel
across the country from Bangkok. He
was requested to reconnoitre the coun-
try to see if any difficulties existed
against the contemplated possibility
of constructing a telegraph between
the two states at an early period.
We believe he was favorably impress-
ed from what he saw, that there were
no obstacles whatever in the way,
which could not be easily surmounted.
Whatever Telegraph Company may
ultimately be induced to embark on
this enterprise, they may rest perfectly
sure of receiving every encouragement
of a reasonable nature both from the
British and Siamese Governments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This work of constructing a line of
telegraph through a foreign territory
must of course be left to private enter-
prise. Whatever the British Govern-
ment may do to connect England
and India, they certainly would feel
averse to turning Telegraph construc-
tors to all the East. It is impossible
to conceive, why there should be any
hesitation on the part of a Private
Company to undertake this good
scheme. Capitalists can find money
to fling into the ocean, hopeless of all
benefit or profit to any one; and yet to
link our own territories with a per-
fectly friendly Asiatic State is a matter
for astonishment. It is hoped that a
scheme so inviting and so full of pro-
mise will be taken in hand before long
and that the day for consultation has
nearly passed and the day of action
has at length arrived.—-Rangoon Times.{{< /news/text >}}

an own cousin on his mother's side, and she

Premium on Babies.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are now certain that the sour old
bachelors in Congress do not control
everything, for the ways and means com-
mittee have agreed that the income tax
shall stand as it is, with this exception,
that fifty dollars shall be added to the
600 exempted from tax for every child
of the family up to fifteen in number
This is reasonable and liberal, and what
a suggestion for increase of population is
embodied in extending the number to
fifteen. That sounds like the good old
times, when a family meant something
more than one or two spoiled children.
To be sure fifty dollars per year is but a
meager allowance for a baby of any size
in these times, but it is something to have
the fact considered, by those who levy
the taxes, that a man who obeys the or-
iginal law of the race and does his part
towards replenishing the earth, necessar-
ily uses up more of his income than the
childless, and uses it too for the benefit
of the country, whose wealth consists in
population. Family men will take cour-
age, and thank the Congressmen who
show this consideration at the same time
of their services and their necessities.—-

{{< news/text >}}A telegram had been received at St.
Petersburg, dated Orenburg, May 20,
which was to the following effect :—-
“Major General Romanowski announces
that on the 8th of May the principal
army of the Emir of Bokhara, number-
ing 40,000 men, and having 21 guns, was
completely routed near Idjar. The Emir
fled to Dyouzak with a hundred Sarbares
and two guns. The remainder of his
artillery, two immense camps, and the
baggage, fell into our hands. The ene-

The Heat
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A maximum temperature of 102° in
the shade against 94° last year, with only
10½ inches of rain against 21, will excuse
some mention of the weather. Bengal
lives in a Turkish bath. Seldom if ever
was such intense and continuous heat
experienced. The oldest inhabitant is
compelled to travel back to 1842 to find
anything approaching to the present wea-
ther. Week after week passes away with-
out change or improvement. The friendly
cloud freighted from the ocean will not
stay, or stays to no purpose. Sharp storms
have proved inadequate to dispel the fiery
atmospheric pall by which the land is en-
veloped. Thunder, lightning and earth-
quake avail nothing, and rain only seems
to evolve caloric from the overcharged
earth, thereby adding steam to other en-
joyments. The Calcutta crows sit with
distended beaks, and the long-legged ad-
jutants have returned to the ice-bound
regions of Chandernagore. The air is in-
tensely sultry-a dull, opaque body of
warm water heavy laden with dust, and
a vertical sun beats upon the city, its nar-
row gullies, impure tanks and crowded
bazaars, with fierce and unrelenting fury.
Palki bearers stagger slowly along with
loads they can scarcely raise, horses lie
dead in many streets killed by the heat,
and the palms and cocoa-nut trees droop
their heads. All nature groans under the
intolerable burden. The fate of the An-
cient Mariner was nothing compared with
that of the Calcutta cockney. Prickly
heat, mosquitoes and imperfect drainage
were unknown to him of “the grey beard
and glittering eye.” Moreover he enjoyed
the advantage of sea-air. The eye falters
beneath an insufferable glare, which causes
the tin dome of Government House to
shine with ineffable glory—another and
vice-regal sun. We exist in a huge ex-
panse, tempered by ice, mango, fish and
ponkahs bodily pulled. Men waste and
fade away under the melting ordeal, and
but for the Directory and Army List
might forget their identity.—-FRIEND OF
INDIA.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A strange story of a fire
proof chest.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}What very nearly amounted to a shock-
ing tragedy, reminding one not a little of
the famous old story of the bride and the
chest, took place at Oxford last Tuesday.
At the handsome Randolph Hotel in that
city, lately built, two men and a boy em-
ployed on the premises, from fun and
curiosity, we believe, got into a very
carefully constructed fireproof plate closet.
Another servant, also in fun, little thinking
what he was doing, closed the door. [..]
fastened with a spring lock, and the hor-
rified victims found themselves enclosed
in an air tight box about three feet square
by six feet high. It is difficult to under-
stand how three persons could have squeez-
ed themselves into such a place, for there
was only just standing room; but such is
the fact. Their cries soon alarmed the es-
tablishment and at last the key was found;
but, as might be expected in the confusion,
under the agonised efforts of the frighten-
ed man who had shut the door, it broke
in the lock. There was now nothing for
it but to break in, but the extraordinary
strength of the door resisted every effort
of several sledge-hammers, wielded by
powerful men, working for the life of their
fellow-creatures. The escape of the pri-
soners was only effected after having
been immured for more than half-an-hour,
by breaking through the wall with proper
mason's tools. The boy had fainted, and
one of the men was bleeding at the nose
and mouth; the other had not yet begun
to suffer visibly, though much distressed.
A very few minutes more—it is said not
more than five—and some, if not all, must
have perished. Considerable crowds col-
lected round the hotel both at the time
and afterwards.-—CHURCHMAN.{{< /news/text >}}

Odds and Ends.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}—"I can't," never crossed the Alps or
raised an acre of corn.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—If you would be nothing, just wait
to be something.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—Look out for the man, or woman,
who is always telling you to look out for
others.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Said a crazy woman, of a penurious,
stingy man, "Do you see that man?"

ming bird's quill into a mosquito's eye,
and the mosquito wouldn't wink!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—Grapple ever with opportunity. And
as you do not know when opportunity
will happen, keep your grappling irons
always ready.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—The man who can make his own fire,
black his own boots, carry his own wood,
hoe his own garden, pay his own debts,
and live without wine and tobacco need
ask no favor of him who rides in a coach-
and-four.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—A Dutchman carried two mugs to
the milkman in place of one, as usual,
and being asked the meaning of it, re-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}plied: “ Dis vor te millich, an’ dis vor

{{< news/text >}}—-An Eastern caliph being sorely a-
flicted with enui, was advised that an
exchange of shirts with a man who was
perfectly happy, would cure him. After
a long search, he discovered such a man,
but was informed that the happy fellow
had no shirt.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}An old picture represents a king sit-
ting in state, with a label, “I govern all,”
—-a bishop with a legend, “I pray for
all,”—-a soldier with a motto, “I fight
for all,” and a farmer, drawing forth
reluctantly a purse, with the superscrip-
tion, “I pay for all.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-Any assurance which does not lead to
more careful walking before God, to
more earnest and deep heart-searchings,
and to quicker and heart felt repentings,
we may rest assured is a false peace—
one that comes from the father of lies,
and not from God.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-Lost wealth may be regained by in-
dustry; the wreck of health restored by
temperance; forgotten knowledge may
be ours again by study; alienated friend-
ship soothed into forgetfulness and even
forfeited reputation redeemed by a life
of patience and virtue. But who ever
again looked upon his vanished hours?—
recalled his wasted years? or erased from
Heaven’s record this fearful blot of was-
ted time?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-“I will extend no other mercy to
you,” said a prince to a jester, who for a
fault, was condemned to death, “except
permitting you to choose what kind of
death you will die.—Decide immediately,
for I will be obeyed.” “I adore your
clemency,” said the jester; I choose to
die of old age.”{{< /news/text >}}

a lazy servant woman was asked
whether she was what is termed afraid
of work. “Not at all; she’ll frequent-

{{< news/text >}}—-It has been said that “the finest
arts are fine manners,” and the saying
is a good and true one. But if man-
ners come from art alone, they can
have only a superficial value. When
they spring from the heart refined by
grace, they are precious as ointment
poured forth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}—-Of a truth there can be no mean-
er type of human selfishness than
that afforded by him, who unmindful
of the world of sin and suffering about
him, occupies himself in the pitiful
business of saving his own soul in the
very spirit of the miser, watching over
his own private hoard while his neigh-

the trouble and worry that men ex-

for the riches and so-called good
things of this life—not having the
calm faith that sustains one in doing

that strength will be given to do the
