Bangkok January 16th
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We had hoped to be able to have
the Recorder make its re-appear-
ance among the citizens of Bang-
kok at the first of the year, so
that it might wish them the com-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}pliments, and congratulations of
the season: but machines to make
haste are still rare in Siam, and we
have been obligied to forego that
pleasure, and be thankful to be able
to appear half a month later. The
reference to our re-appearance may
perhaps need some explanation.
About twenty years ago there was
a journal issued from this office, to
which was given the name of
Bangkok Recorder. It was wholly
in the Siamese language, and we
trust was the means of conveying
to many of this people much useful
information.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They were not however yet in
a condition fully to appreciate such
an enterprise, and partly on ac-
count of sickness in the family of
one of the parties concerned, and
the increased duties of the other, it
was discontinued, after a brief, but
we trust useful existence, of one
year and three months.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The present Journal, although
in a somewhat different form, we
think may justly claim to be a con
tinuation of that one, and conse-
quently the first newspaper pub-
lished in Bangkok. Supposing the
proper time to have come for such
an event, we now take pleasure in
offering to the citizens of Bangkok
and others, this revised edition of
the Recorder.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have not undertaken this,
with any malicious designs upon
any similar enterprise, which may
have started up in the mean time.
Far from it; we wish all well. One
newspaper however creates a ne
cessity for another. Of all mono-
polies, that of newspapers is the
worst. Whether there was a ne-
cessity for a  paper here at all at
present, of course is not for us to
say; but the existence of one,
implies the necessity for another.
There are always two sides to any
question, and it is well to hear
both.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Things have changed materially
in Siam since the Recorder made
its first appearance. The late king
had decided upon an exclusive
policy. Supposing himself to be
the greatest monarch of the day,
he was disposed to have but little
to do with those whom he conid-
ered his inferiors. No one was
permitted to see him, unless by
accident. Not seeming to know
the old proverb that, "A cat may
look at a king," when he made his
annual visits to the Wats, foreigners
were forced by his officers into
their houses, and the doors shut,
and they were obliged to look
through the bars like the inmates
of some menagery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Prince more friendly disposed
to foreigners, has since ascended
the throne, and those foolish re-
strictions have in a great measure
been removed. Commercial treat-
ies have been negotiated with the
principle Western powers, so that
even here "Japheth dwells in the
tent of Shem" in security.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The western arts and sciences
have also been introduced to some
extent, so that when we hear the
snort of the engine, or the shriek
of the whistle, we almost forget
the surroundings and imagine our-
selves for a time in the western
world. After all that has been
written, however, about this coun-
try, it is astonishing how little is
known concerning it abroad.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We were amused not long since
in reading the following in the
Youths Department of the New
York Observer, a paper as ably
conducted and having as large a
circulation as any in the United
States. "In Siam, a Kingdom in
Asia, lying is punished by having
the mouth sewed up." During a
season like the present when rice
is scarce and dear, such a punish-
ment might be in some degree
beneficial, for in such an event,
the home consumption of the great
staple of the country would soon
materially decrease. We suppose
there is scarcely any other place
to be found where lying is so nearly
systemetized as here.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Western editors however are
dependent. upon such information
as they can get concerning Orien-
tal countries, and we have men-
tioned in another column some of
the sources of information con-
cerning Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This kingdom has resources un-
surpassed by any of its size in the
world. It devolves upon us then,
who have taken up our residence
here for a time, to inform the
world at large what there really is
in Siam, and to assist in developing
her resources. This is not done by
commercial enterprise alone,—the
mere buying the commodities they
have for sale, and in giving them
others in exchange,—although this
is a step in the right direction.
They have had a little taste of
western civilization, and that
should be so managed as to give
them a thirst for more. We must
be careful not to flatter the vanity
of those in power which is already
praised to quite too high a pitch.
We must arouse them from their
lethargy, and stimulate them to
habits of industry. We must dis-
seminate among them the germs
of true civilization, and give them
an impulse upon the true road of
progress. We must bring out the
productive power of the country.
This is not the work of a day, but
perhaps of centuries. Europe has
been over eighteen centuries in
reaching her present high state of
civilization. In this great work
the press must occupy a preemi-
nent place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among ourselves too, the press,
if rightly conducted, may become
highly beneficial. It acts as a
monitor in any community. It
rubs off asperities, and corrects
errors. It matters not how small
a community may be, there will
be occasion for controversy. Of
course such should not be encour-
aged; but when it does arise, it
should be conducted to the best
advantage. Through the press
each one can vindicate his own
cause, and expose the errors of his
opponent. It should not however
be abused. Vile vituperations
should be avoided. Handle an
opponent sharply if necessary, but
do it gentlemanly. The English
language is ample, surpassed by
none except the French, in delicate
expression. There is no necessity
then to descend to vulgarisms.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But a truce to this, for the pres-
ent. We offer the Recorder, to
the citizens of Bangkok and
others. We shall try to merit a
liberal share of patronage. We
shall try to do justice to all, but
will flatter none.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
TO THE EDITOR OF THE BANGKOK
RECORDER.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}SIR.—Nothing seems more manifest, than
the duty of the conductors of public Jour-
nals in such a country as Siam, to do all in
their power to promote a good understand-
ing between native and foreign officials.
They should endeavor to allay rather than
increase any irritation or misunderstanding
which may arise in the necessary intercourse 
of these officials. They should doubtless
be ready to resent on behalf of His Majesty 
and the native officials any manifest and 
intentional rudeness or insult. But on the
other hand they should be ready to main- 
tain, that true respect may be felt and intend-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ed when for good reasons, there may be
slight departure from usual courses. And
from such a departure the native officials
should neither infer nor charge intentional
insult, till opportunity is had for mutual
explanation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These thoughts were suggested by the
perusal of a communication with the caption
of "Bangkok Gossip" in the "Siam Times"
of January 8th. The writer of that article
insinuates and the Editorial endorsement
does not discountenance the insinuation,
that His Majesty the Supreme King of Siam
has been made the victim of a hoax, in the
perpetration of which the entire British
Consular staff, and the Governor General of
India are implicated. The Editor of the
"Siam Times" has complimented the
credulity rather than the intelligence of
the simple minded community of the
Kingdom of Siam in venturing the pub-
lication of such an insinuation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is perhaps too much to expect that
native officials, who have been long trained
to place prime importance upon custom and
mere routine, should be entirely free from
suspicion of intended insult, when they find
even a slight departure from usual forms.
But every intelligent European must see at
a glance, that the perpetration of such a
hoax as is insinuated in the "Siam Times"
is impossible. The publication of such an
insinuation is, in this instance, the more
culpable, as an inquiry in the right quarter
would have put the Editor in possession of
all the facts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If, for any cause, His Majesty has indulged
a momentary suspicion that he bas been
made a victim of a hoax, such that suspi-
icion is removed by the knowledge of the
facts: His Majesty will owe no gratitude
to those who have been the medium of
publishing each suspicion to the European
world. It will do His Majesty no credit
in the courts of Europe, to have indulged
the thought, even for a moment, that per-
son of his high character and high position
of the Governor General of India, could
either have perpetrated or connived at the
perpetration of a hoax upon his Majesty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Consular officials specially interested
in the case, in accordance with their usual
custom, may not publicly notice the impu-
tation upon their honor contained in the
article in question, but the fostering of such
suspicions by the publication of such articles
is an injustice not only to them, but to every
official and private person, who has any
intercourse with the court of Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If the "Siam Times" indulges in many
of the "blunders" which can scarcely be
called "amusing" the "Siam community"
must be very "simple minded" and "very
forbearing" not to "allow it to operate
prejudicially against the paper" whether it
be "very rough ragged and crooked" or
smooth even and straight.{{< /news/text >}}

BOOKS ON SIAM
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a certain very old book we read some
thing like this, "Of making books there is
no end, and much study is a weakness of
the flesh", The author of these words had
a high reputation for wisdom in his day,
but we can scarcely be persuaded that he
relied wholly upon his own wisdom, when
he uttered the words already quoted. He
must certainly have had a glimpse into the
future, and his words must in some degree,
look forward to the present for their fulfil-
ment. The present is emphatically an age
of book making. There are those who fol-
low it as a business, and "companies and
land" for matter to fill up their almost
countless pages. There are also a set of
abold adventurers, whose highest amition
appears to be to ascend some broad river,
or penetrate into some great forest, hitherto
untrodden by the foot of white man ; then
inspired by their imaginations, they astonish
the world with an account of their discov-
eries. Such works Robert Barns seems to
have described very correctly though per-
haps unintentionally when he said, —{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Some books are lies frae end to end",
It is greatly to be regretted that most books
upon Oriental comitries have been written
by such adventurers, or at best by mere
cutvory travelers, who know nothing of the
language of the countries through which 
they passed, and gave credunce and public-
ity to all the aboard stories which met their
ears, Siam has not been wholly exempt
from such inenrsions, From very early ad-
ventures in Siam we have but little, if any
thing, that is at all rellabhb, In 1841 Mr.
Crawford was sent by the Governor General
of India, on a friendly mission to the courts
of Siam, and Cochin Chine. His mission
was a failure; but considering the small
facilities then offered during his short stay
here, he acquired nach information concern-
ing the country, and his journal, though
necessarily brief is perhaps as free from
crror as any thing we have on Siam,even yet.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The next thing we have in the shape of a 
book is entitled a "Residence in Siam,"
by Fredric Arthur Neale. Who Fredric
Arthur Neale was, it would now probably
be dificult to find out ; nor would even
success pay the expenses of an effort. From
the title page of his book we learn, that he
is also the author of "Eight Years in Syria,
Palestine, and Asia Minor." How long a
residence ho lind in Siam we do not know;
but judging from his book, we think it
could not, at furthest, have exceeded three
months. He givos place to the wildest ex-
aggerations, and his highest aim appears
to have been to produce a readable book,
regardless of truth. During his stay here,
according to his own story, he was General-
in-chief of his late Majesty's forces, and
High Admiral of his Navy; and was ever
active in chasing some notorious pirate in
the Gulf, or quelling some incipient rebel-
lion, upon land. His sketches too are the
merest cariatures imaginable, and many of
them quite foreign to Siam. Occasionally,
too, he indulges in a right well directed
shot at the American Missionaries, for whom
he appears to have entertained a peculiar
antipathy. This one thing however, he
brings out pretty fully; but perhaps rather
unintentionally, that is, that during his
residence here, he was a loafer upon their
hospitality, and perhaps the purse of the
late Mr. Hunter. He has however rather
a sprightly style, and excepting, where he
occasionally descends almost in the vulgar,
his book is, not withstanding his exaggera-
tions, upon the whole a readable one.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir John Bowring after negotiating, in
1855, a friendly treaty between H. B. M.
Government, and the Kings of Siam, had
also the ambition to make a book. He
however proves to be one of the driest of all
book writers, usually denominated com-
pilers. He seems to have possessed to
perfection, the somewhat rare faculty, of
pumping to exhaustion all those with whom
he came in contact, and then of turning
the information, thus acquired, to his own
account.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The journals of early adventurers, the
annals of the Propaganda, the Chinese
Repository, the Missionary Magazine and
Bishop Pallegoix's book have all been ran
sacked by him, and extracts from these,
together with all the information pumped
from the Missionaries and others, and even
His Majesty himself, are all conglomerated
in one mass, of two octavo volumes, of about
nine hundred pages, without correction, and
poorly arranged. His book possesses all
errors atleast without even half the spright-
liness of Neale.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Occasionally however we find a few, who
actuated by true love of science, and a
desire to promote the interests, leave home,
family, and friends, and risk, and sacrifice
their lives in their cause. Among such I
think we may justly classs the late M. Henri
Mouhot. He was indefatigable, undaunted
by wild beasts, and sometimes wilder men, or
even jungle fever. He traversed the moun-
tainous regions around Prabat, Patawee,
and Chantaboon ; and thence to Cambodia,
where, despite all the enreaties of the
Catholic priests, and the natives, he pen-
etrates to the heart of their country, and
spends three months among the savage
Stiena. He thence makes his way to the
great ruins of Ougear, of which he gives
an excellent description. Returning to
Bangkok, he again sets out, crosses the
great jungle, Dong Phya Fai to Korat and
Luang Prabang where he falls a victim to
fever.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The journal of M. Mouhot, edited by his
brother, has lately reached us. It was
written by him, oftentimes,, under the most
averse circumstances, frequently by the
light of a torch, after having been detained
all day by the pitiless rain, and enduring
the "galling fire" of an army of musketoes.
It is written in a clear and simple style,
and shows that he have been a close and
correct observer of all passing around him.
Where he trusts to his own observation he
is correct, but where he gives credence to
others, he falls into the errors of his pre-
decessors.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When he occasionally refers to the po-
litical bearings of the countries through
which he passed, he of course takes a French
stand point, but this is nothing more than
we would expect from a thorough French-
man. The really scientific part of M.
Mouhot’s book we have not examined; but
we take it for granted that it is correct,
as he no doubt was eminently qualified by
scientific attainments for the great task
which he willingly undertook{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}M. Mouhot also possessed very high social
qualifications, which endeared him to all with
whom he came in contact. Some of his
articles are imperfectly correct, but had
he been allowed to edit his own work, he
would no doubt have corrected them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His statement concerning the missionary
operations here is erroneous; but this we
suppose is one of the instances in which he
relied upon the information of others. We
still believe that had he, in the providence
of God, been permitted to edit his own
journal, he would have taken pains to in-
form himself more correctly upon the sub-
ject. Science is indebted to M. Mouhot
for several new specimens, and he may
justly be ranked among her martyrs.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir,—I see our Southern journals are
leading their readers to believe that the
struggle for the restoration of the Union is
about to be abandoned from the exhaus-
tion of the North. The month which I
have just passed in the Northern and West-
ern States, has led me to an opposite con-
clusion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is exhaustion, of course, as there
is towards the close of every long battle day.
At Illinois, towards evening, both armies
were at the last gasp, yet the Swedes were
able to make the supreme effort which gave
them victory. The government has got
more men than Grant called for, by volun-
teering, and in the districts where volun-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}tearing was slack the draft is going on
without resistance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Chicago Convention, it is true, was
not only pacific but secessionist. But Mc
Clellan, the nominee of that convention;
kicks over its platform and declares re-
peatedly and emphatically in his letter of
acceptance that the Union must be restored
at all hazards. The only question on which
he is prepared to give way to the South is
that of slavery. The mass of the party, who
support him are War Democrats ; and they
are for war, not as name only but in deed.
They have therefore no base on the Repub-
licans, though they do not, like the Republi-
cans, make the abolition of slavery pre-
sent or prospective, as well as the restorstion
of the Union, a condition of peace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The democratic party is out, and not
being accustomed to be out, it wants very
much to be in. Thus I believe, in as much
as anything else, the Key to the present
attempt to oust the Republican government.
If the Conservatives had ousted the Palmer-
ston government the other day, there would have
been no material change in our policy
towards Denmark.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}According to the best judgments, how-
ever, which I can gather, McClellan as
matters now stands, has no chance of elec-
tion. At least, all the enemies of America
in Europe, who are shouting in the prospect
of his triumph, had better adjourn their
exultation till their victory is won. I see
they were a little premature in letting off
their fireworks in honor of the victory of
Hood before Atlanta.
    That the war is national, not carried on
by the government alone, nobody which
has been in the country a day can doubt.
Every sign of popular participation is
around you :— soldiers' rests, and soldier's
homes, supported by voluntary contribu-
tions and attended by voluntary nurses;
immense subscriptions to the Sanitary Com-
mission and every benevolent object con-
nected with the war. It is remarkable
that, though the subscriptions are so large,
the names of the subscribers are not pub-
lished.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Anxiety is expressed, of course, on all
hands as to the financial prospects of the
country. But the present burden of tax-
ation, including a heavy income-tax, is so
far as I can see, cheerfullliy borne, even by
those who must feel it most.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have not heard a single sentiment of
atrocity, or even of hatred, uttered against
the South. But I have heard on all sides the
expression of a resolve determination to
make the South submit to the law. And this
determination I believe rules the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let the South submit to the law, and
there is no thought of amnesty and res-
toration. Nor does it seem to me irrational
to expect that, when the ambitious leaders
of the revolt are out of the way, the depen-
dents whom they have dragged into the
field will soon settle down again into quiet
members of the Union.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I am confirmed in the belief that this war,
as compared with previous civil wars, is
being carried on with great humanity on
the part of the North. I visited, the other
day, a large encampment of Confederate
prisoners at Chicago. These men seemed
to me to be as well treated and as cheerful
as prisoners could be; and this, be it ob-
served, at a time when the North is ringing
with the accounts of the atrocities undergone
by Northern prisoners at the hands of the
Confederates. The same visit convinced
me that the Confederate conscription has
pretty nearly well exhausted the Southern
population, for I saw among the prisoners
the merest boys.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The growth of popular sentiment on the
subject of negro slavery is gratifying. By
the law of Illinois, negroes are still excluded
from the State; but this law has become
a dead letter. I saw negroes at church with
the whites, and I observed that they stayed
for the communion. Illinois farmers tell
me that the negro make a good day labourer.
Soldiers—not political generals, but com-
pany officers and privates—tell me that he
makes an excellent soldier. The plantor can
no longer talk of the inherent inferiority of
a race, which proves itself a match for his
own race in the field.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have seen no signs of diminished pros-
perity, except in the empty docks of New
York, which tell the tale of the Alabama.
On the contrary, trade seems marvellously
active, and buildings are rising on all sides.
The commercial prosperity may be partly
artificial, arising out of the expenditure caus-
ed by the war. But the agricultural pros-
perity is more real. Illinois has sent, ac-
cording to the government returns, 170,000
men—a fifth part of its labouring popula-
tion—to the war. Yet the harvest is greater
than in any former year. Its gross value is
supposed to be four hundred millions of
dollars, no inconsiderable part of the national
debt. The invention of machines, which the
dearness of labor has stimulated, has made
up for the loss of laborers. The State Fair
the other day was attended by 20,000
people. The show of implements was ex-
traordinary, and the highest prices were
given for stock.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I heard from the lips of a Secessionist, a
description of the enthusiasm with which
those inhabitants of Illinois had rushed
to arms when the first gun was fired
against a Federal fortress, by the South.
I passed villages which had sent forth a
fourth of them to combat at Fort Don-
elson, Twenty-four fell, and their bodies
were carefully brough back to their village

course were "mercenaries" and "Irish."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have been in the States only a month,
and perhaps I am not an unbiased ob-
server, but my strong conviction is, that
beneath the frothy surface of party politics
(never very august in any country) and the
shoddy luxury of New York, lies a great
nation, meeting the extremity of peril with
courage. self devotion, passionate attach-
ment to its country, and unshaken confi-
dence in its own power. I am no judge of
military matters, but at present it seems
as though the insults and slanders which
have been passed on the American-born
the aristocratic and reactionary press of
Europe, were about to be answered by vic-
tory.–-I am, &c.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
TO THE EDITOR OF THE
Bangkok Recorder.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}DEAR SIR :—A few hints from the outside
observer, as to the mode of conducting your
paper may not be unacceptable. First of
all, you must carefully repress any feeling
of modest diffidence, which may naturally
arise upon entering on a new and untried
vocation. Encourage high expectations of
a brilliant success, and be daily impressed
with the dignity of your position, and the
importance of your undertaking. Assume
that the advent of the Recorder is not only
"the crowning event of the year,” but “as
far as Siam is concerned the most important
in its history." Some indeed may say that
the introduction of the press itself, and the
printing of books, and especially the New
Testament in the vernacular were more im-
portant events than the publication in Eng-
lish of your modest sheet. But, serene in
your own conscious superiority, you should
disregard such remarks, considering them
only as proofs of the hostility of malevo-
lent individuals” who are incapable of ap-
preciating the transcendent importance of
your labors. Are you not a sovereign, reign-
ing supreme in the “ fourth estate?” Your
sceptre may be only a goose quill, and your
throne a deal wood tripod; but the latter is
a little higher than the royal seat, and the
former mightier than the kingly baton. You
should therefore "immediately assume"
your true position as the "appellate court,"
"the advisors or arbitrators between the
governing and the governed." A royal
progress is usually heralded by a trumpet;
so you too mast learn to blow lustily your
own brazen trumpet. Silver notes might
he more melodious in a quiet circle of
friends, but will not answer your purpose.
If you should become weary, hand the in-
strument to a friend at your elbow, who
you know will give it a certain sound. I
do not doubt your eminent ability to suc-
cessfully conduct your enterprise, but if you
could find a friend to embark with you,
who from pure benevolence, would be con-
tent to take the helm, and guide your craft,
and even in an emergency take the laboring
oar, it might prove of great service.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to the literary part of your labors it
will not pay (and to make it pay is of
course your object) to be too particular.
You will of course have to take your corres-
pondents as you find them, but even in
writing your leading articles, it may be well
to remember that you are not in the
Queen’s dominions and that in this juris-
diction there is no penalty for murdering
the Queen’s English. I would advise that
you studiously aim at what I will call a
superlative style. Your copper pence must
all be golden guineas, you geese all swans,
your crows all eagles. —Your stars must
not only be of the  "first magnitude" but
the "most brilliant" of their class. Your
success, if you are so fortunate as to have
any, must not only be reasonably good, but
"greed" and "without a parallel in the his-
tory of the fourth states.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If you have occasion to notice individu-
als, your articles should always be well
seasoned with flattery ; such dishes are sure
to tickle the palate; and the thrilling sen-
sation may extend through the fingers to
the purse. Your readers will expect you to
court the mises for their benefit, and give
them now an then a little original poetry.
You may complain that there is no Parnas-
sus in your field of vision, and that the
muddy waters of Klawn Bang Luang, do
not flow from the pure Castalian fount. But
the Genius of poetry may be, like her sister
woman, "quite Omnipotent" when by her
aid you can create your own Parnassus, and
clarify as clear as those which flow from
mount Helicon. If, however, the coy god-
dess should obstinately refuse her aid to
your solicitations, I will, for yout comfort,
just whisper in your ear that you may
import an article in this the almost equal
to homemade.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If, after all your efforts, your paper will
not sell, should you not deem the tran-
sition from the throne to the auction block
too great, you might hint that you are your-
self in the market; and if you give the hint
a sufficiently sharp point, it may prove "a
word to the wise." You must ever maintain 
a magnanimous learning toward the en-
tire community. Your every issue may
furnish evidence that, at whatever cost to
other interests, you are zealously laboring to
forward the interests of your particular
clique. Still with hat in hand, and smile on
the lips, you must make your best bow to
the dear public, protesting that you are its
most humble servant, ready to devote your
whole energies to its properity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A moderate share of attention to these
hints, Mr. Editor, cannot fail to bring you
new enterprise up to the standard of the{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/right >}}
TIMES.

{{< news/text >}}How a "Copperhead" was Shaved—
The Philadelphia North American tells the
following story:—A well-known frequenter
of Third street, stopped yesterday in a
barber shop, close to the North American
building. sat in a shaving chair, drew a
newspaper from his pocket, and instructed
the knight of the razor to take off his beard.
The barber was an African. He simply
replied "Yes, boss," and produced his im-
plements. The customer sat down. He
was duly shaved. His face was wiped, and
and he arose, donned his coat and hat. "How
much?" he asked, in a dolorous voice, as
he adjusted his shirt collar. "Fifteen cents
boas" "Why, I thought you shaved for ten
cents at this shop." "Dat an's de average,
aah,"was the reply. "Ten cents is de price
ob a shave in dis yer shop. You come in
here, aah, and read de news ob Sheridian's
victory, and your face got bent six inches
longer dan when you came in. If your face
was like it was afore you read dat yar news,
ten cents, was the price. When you com-
menced to read bout de defeat ob Early,
den your face stretched down about four
inches. Dat's what makes it wurf fifteen
cents for dat shave." The customer couldn't
couldn't restrain a grin, though he was a Copper-
head, and the hit at him was made by a
"nigger." He laid down the fee, and walked
out. He was one of those gentlemen who
go their length upon McClellan, and who of
course shudder at every victory to the
Union arms.{{< /news/text >}}

stantly loaded. Sometimes they come close
to our quarters, and we cannot go even a
few steps into the woods without hearing
them. As general rule, however, they
fly from the approach of man, and in order
to get a shot, it is necessary to lie in wait
either amongst the branches of a tree, or
hidden among the brushwood, near the
spots where they come to drink.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Scorpions, centipedes, and abort all ser-
nents were the enemies we most dreaded,
and against which precautions were chiefly
requisite, but the mosquitoes and the leech-
es, though less dangerous, were the most
troublesome and the most inveterate plagues.
During the rainy season you cannot be too
much on your guard ; going to bed or get-
ting up, you are over in peril of putting a
hand or foot on some venomous snake. I
have killed more than one in my house with
a gun or hatchet. As I write, I am obliged
to be continually on the watch, fearing to
see one re-appear on which I trod this even-
ing, but which made its exit without hurt-
ing me. From time to time, also, I stop
to listen to the roaring of a tigers, when he
wanders round our dwelling and look
more longingly at the pigs through their fence
of planks and bamboos. Again, I hear a
rhinoceros breaking down the bamboos
which opposes his progress towards the bram-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}bles encircling our garden; on which he in-
tends to banquet.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The savage tribes, who inhabit this reg-
ion, have probably the sme origin as those
who people the mountains and the table-
land, which separate the Itngdoms of Laos
and Cambodia from that of Annam, and
which extend across the great stride from 11°
north lat, and between 100° and 108° east
longitude. They form so many separate com-
munities as there are villages, and it seems to
be a race distinct from all the people who
surround them. I am merely inclined to
believe them to be the aboriginees of the
country, and to suppose that they have
been driven back from the Sea and the
rivers to the districts now occupied by them,
by the successive invations of the Taibetans,
who have have spread themselves over Laos,
Siam, and Cambodia, and nothing that I
can discover leads to ay other supposition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These savages are so strongly attached to
their forests and mountains, that to quit
them seems almost like death, and those
who are dragged as slaves to the neighbor-
ing countries, languish under captivity, and
try every methods of escape, frequently wtih
success. Like other savages, they have ap-
peared formidable to their neighbors, and
the fear inspired by them has occasioned
exaggerated reports of their wonderful skill
in shooting with the bow, as well as the
pestilential climate. However, it is a fact
that fever prevails here terribly; numbers
of Annamites, and Cambodians, have fallen
victims to it, and I am assured that I am
the only stranger who has come without
suffering from it more or less. These people
love the deep shade of the pathless woods,
which they do not trouble themselves to cut
down, and if they cling to their country,
they do not to any particular locality, for
if they meet with any inconvenience in their
own neighborhood, or if any of their family
die of fever, they raise their camp, take their
children in baskets on their backs, and set off
to make a settlement elsewhere, land is not
wanting, and the forest is everywhere alike.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These tribes are nearly independent, al-
though the Cambodians on one side, and
the Laotians and Annamites on the other,
levy on the villages near them a triennial
tribute of rice and wax. The King of Cam-
bodia does not want the will to treat the
Steins as he did the Thiamwa, in order to
people some of his desert provinces.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The inscription placed—alas so vainly—
on our public offices is here, notwithstand-
ing the slavery, the motto of the people, and
its sincerity is evidenced in their practice.
We use words ; they act. If there is abun-
dance at one house, the whole village shares
in it, and when scarcity prevails, which is
often the case, all alike suffer.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They work admirably in iron and ivory,
and some tribes are noted, as in Annam,
for their hatchets and the beautiful work-
manship of their sabres. Their drinking-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}vessels are rude, but of their own manufac-
ture, and the women weave and dye the
long fine scarves which they wear, the best
of which are often valued at the price of an
ox. They cultivate rice, maize, tobacco,
various kinds of vegetables and fruit trees,
such as bananas, mangoes, and oranges.
Every person of any substance possesses
several slaves, and a field, always at some dis-
tance from the village, which is very careful-
ly attended to. In these fields in little huts
raised on piles, the Stiens pass the whole
of the rainy season, during which they can
neither hunt nor fish, both on account of
the inclement weather and the leeches, the
immense numbers of which, as in the forests
of Siam, make them a perfect pest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Their manner of preparing a rice-field is
very different from the way in which our
agriculturists set about matters. As soon
as the first rains begin to fall, the Stien
chooses his ground, and busies himself in
clearing it. This would be a laborious task
for a European; but he, with his hatchet
with cane handle, has in a few days cut
down a thicket of bamboos 100 or 150
metres square. If he meets with any tree
too large for him to manage, he leaves it
standing. After a few days, when the canes
are a little dry, he sets fire to them, and
the field is soon cleared. As for the roots,
he cares little about them, as no digging is
required; on the virgin soil everything
grows with little labour. There only remains
to sow the seed, and for this purpose he
takes two long bamboos, which he lays in
a line on the ground; then, with a stick in
each hand, he makes on each side of this
line, holes about an inch or an inch and a
half deep at short distances. The men’s
work is now finished, and that of the women
begins. stooping down, she follows the line
traced made by her husband, and from a basket
carried over her left side takes a handful of
rice, of which she throws a few grains into
each hole with great rapidity, and at the
same time so dexterously that it is very far
any to fall outside. In a few hours the
task is finished, for here there is no need
of harrow or plough; kind Nature will soon
send some violent showers, which, washing
the soil over the holes, will cover the seeds.
Then the proprietor establishes himself in
his hut, where, as he smokes his cigarette
(made of tobacco rolled in some leaf), he
lets fly his arrows at the wild boars, apes,
or goats, or amuses himself by frightening
away the doves and parroquets. To this
end, a couple of bamboos are so placed in
the middle of the field, that by pulling a
handful of rattan, they continually strike
against each other, and the noise scares
away the birds, which without some such
contrivance would cat up all the seed. The
harvest is reaped at the end of October.
Generally, two months previously poverty
and famine begin to make themselves felt.
As long as provisions last they feast without
ever thinking of the morrow; when they
are exhausted they are reduced to eat ser-
pents, toads, and bats, which last are found
in great numbers in the hollows of the old
bamboo. Often they have even to content
themselves with the roots of the maize,
young bamboo-shoots, wild roots, and other
spontaneous productions of the ground. **

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The rumor current here two days ago
that one of the royal steamers had capsized
near the mouth of Petchaburee river, and
many persons consequently drowned, proves
to be quite false, if the Lord Mayor be cor-
rectly informed. A small ear boat was
upset in that vicinity, but no lives lost.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}An Officer of government was killed in
going over to P. in one of the royal yachts,
in a time of much rolling of the vessel, by
a marble table or some other heavy article
of furniture, falling on his chest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another person of the royal retinue, was
taken sick at Petchaburee and died in this
city soon after his return.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With the above exceptions, it is believed
that nothing has transpired to disturb the
peace and quietness of His Supreme Majesty
the king of Siam, in the progress of the
present grand royal festival at Petchaburee,
for the Hair cutting of several of His Ma-
jesty's royal offspring.{{< /news/text >}}
