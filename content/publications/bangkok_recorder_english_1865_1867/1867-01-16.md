the heavy cavalry into horse artillery.
Armed with this new gun the French

Borneo.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Borneo, with the exception of Austra-
lia (now denominated a continent) is the
largest and richest island in the world;
it extends from 7° North latitude to 4°
South and from 109° to 119° East longi-
tude. Its broad and deep rivers abound
in fish; its forests are stored with the choi-
cest timber, spice, fruit, and medicinal
trees; its plains are fertile and produce
in abundance with the slightest cultiva-
tion Sugar-cane, Cotton, Rice, Pepper,
Tobacco, and other tropical productions;
its mines yield Tin, Copper, Coal, Anti-
mony, diamonds and silver; auriferous
ranges similar to and a continuation of
those of Australia extend, according to
Sir R. Murchison, through its centre un-
til they are lost among the numerous is-
lands in the southern Indian Archipela-
go; deer, wild cattle, and hogs, and ele-
pha nts, roam through its gorgeous jun-
gles; its beaches are covered with turtle;
while the pearl banks and beeche-de-mere
fisheries, the edible birds' nests and gums,
are peculiar to itself and are unequalled
elsewhere. Its climate is salubrious, far
more so than any other localities in the
same latitudes, attributable probably to
the elevation of its table lands, and the
immediate rise of the shore from the sea.
The interior of the island is inhabited by
the aboriginal tribes called, indifferently,
Dyaks, Muruts, and Idaan. The sea
shore on the western side is held by Ma-
lays, Illanuns and Badjoes, on the East-
ern by Salus and a mixed race. The
aborigines are of a similar race to the
inhabitants of the surrounding islands,
and also New Guinea, New Caledonia,
and the Feejees, Pagan in religion, sav-
age and blood thirsty in nature, with a
tendency to cannibalism, but faithful to
their words and courteous in conduct to
travelers who treat them kindly and
manifest no fear of them. The residents
on the sea shore acquired their position
by right of conquest, and hold it even
now, after the lapse of nearly two cen-
turies, at the point of the spear. The
advantages of trade however serve to
keep up a sort of peace, or rather armed
neutrality, each being dependent on the
other, one for cargo, the other for cus-
tomers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Borneo was very little known to Euro-
peans until the year 1839 when Captain
Brooke visited and established himself
in the province of Sarawak. This was
followed soon after by Sir Thomas Coch-
rane's crusade against the Malay and
Illanun pirates, the destruction of Brunei,
Tampasuk and Maroodu, the complete
overthrow of the pirate holds, the down
fall of the Sultan's power, and the ces-
sion of the island of Labuan to the Brit-
ish Crown, the particulars of which will
be found set forth at length in Rajah
Brooke's published journal. In 1841 Mr.
Brooke was appointed Rajah of Sarawak
by the late Sultan Omar Ali Saifeddin,
and in 1863, his authority was formally
recognized by Great Britain and the
United States.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Slavery exists in Borneo, but in a very
mild way, as it is ever found among Ma-
homedans. In this respect the Moslem
religion fairly puts the Christian to the
blush. It has of course been abolished
in Sarawak and Labuan and will doubt-
less soon be in Ambong and Maroodu.
The timber of Borneo is of the finest
description and can be procured at a
very small expense, in unlimited quanti-
ties—the entire demand of all Chinas
might be readily satisfied from this source
alone on far easier terms than those from
any other quarter.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Borneo is mountainous throughout its
entire length, though more so from Bar-
ram point to the extreme northern point,
but the magnificent mountain of Kins-
Balu, 13,000 feet high, towers proudly
above all the rest as a Brobdignagian
chieftain lords it over Lilliputian serfs.
This noble peak is distinctly visible in a
clear day over 60 miles at sea, possesses
rich stores of minerals in its mighty
womb, and is destined at no very distant
day, to contain the favorite shrine of
Hygein, to which all her eager votaries
from the lower parts of the China Sea
will hasten to pay their humble adoration.
Mr. Low, the Colonial Treasurer of La-
buan, whose explorations in Borneo, and
valuable contributions to the cause of
Science therefrom, have inseparably link-
ed his name with the scientific history of
the island, ascended this mountain sever-
al times, and was the first to introduce
to the notice of the botanical world the
magnificent Nepenthis or Pitcher plant,
a flower peculiar to this mountain; of all
the species the Nepenthis Lowii is the
loveliest and most graceful. The lowest
temperature registered by him was 36°5,
Fahrenheit, upon the summit. A Sana-
tarium on the Marei-Parei Spur, at about
4,800 feet elevation, would be a most
delightful resort for the debilitated and
fever stricken patients of the East. The
climate is delightful, the average of tem-
perature is, at daylight 56°: at midday
75°, and at sunset 63°{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The principal products peculiar to
Borneo AS FAR AS YET DISCOVERED, are
the fine white birds' nests, baru camphor
gum damar. The entire supplies of the
former comestible are now derived from
this island; inferior qualities, mixed with
feathers, are still brought from other
parts of the Archipelago, but the fine
quality of nests is Bornean. The baru
camphor is too well known in the markets
here, to require particular description,
but the uninitiated will form an idea of
its strength and fine quality, when they
learn that while Formosan, or the ordi-
nary camphor of commerce, is worth in
this market some $20 per PICUL, Bornean
camphor sells readily at $36 per CATTY.
The gum damar abounds, is of a very
clear, white color, and differs in superi-
ority of quality from the ordinary damar
of the Malay peninsula. The other ar-
ticles of export are gutta percha, Indian
rubber, gum Benjamin, rattans, cubebs,
cassia bark, sago, pepper, wax, cotton,
rice, tortoise shell, pearls, beche de mer,
ivory, tobacco, spices mahogany, lignum
vitæ, (abastard species) Puon and cam-
phor wood.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nothing but the unconquerable indo-
lence of the natives prevents this Coun-
try from being the centre of a traffic, as
far superior to that of China and Singa-
pore as a mountain surpasses in magni-
tude a mole hill. The decline of North-
ern Borneo as a great commercial em-
porium, dates from the expulsion and
extermination of the Chinese, who once
possessed and civilized nearly the whole
of the Northern sea Coast, both on the
Eastern and Western shores. Their own
arrogance and presumption led to their
overthrow, and it is estimated that up-
wards of 60,000 perished under the
creeses and parangs of the warlike Ma-
lays, whom they had endeavored to brow-
beat and oppress. Traces of their oc-
cupation are every where found, and
even the language and religion linger
among the inhabitants of the interior.
The Chinese can only exist out of China
in peace, as a servile race: if allowed
any ascendancy, or even equality with
other races, murder and rapine at once
assume the sway. Witness the districts
of their own country, where the yoke of
the Tartar conqueror is in the least de-
gree lightened or becomes weakened,
the Taeping or Nienfei springs into ex-
istence at once. Witness the Chinese
insurrection at Sarawak, in 1857, when
Rajah Brooke was reduced to such ex-
tremity, as to be compelled to swim a
small river to save his life; and nothing
but the opportune arrival of the Borneo
Company's steamer saved the European
population from extermination nor was
it until upwards of 7,000 Chinese had
fallen under the spears and sumpitans of
his gallant Dyak warriors, that he was
enabled to recover his authority and
drive the remnant of the rebels across
the frontier into Sambas. Witness Hong-
kong, where since the introduction of
Exeter Hall ethics, and the decoration
of the seats of Justice with festoons of
red tape, the public streets at certain
points are tabooed to the European un-
provided with a revolver, and where
pirates' craft are fitted out, with the
scarcely-concealed intention of preying
upon the peaceful trader leaving the
harbor, and returning expose, unchecked,
the fruits of their raid publicly in the
bazaars for sale, still stained with the
blood of their murdered victims. No!
the Chinese are neither pleasant neigh-
bors nor good colonists, and better far
that the sensual doctrines of Mahomet
or the rude creed of the honest unbe-
liever should prevail in Borneo, than the
polished barbarism and refined wicked-
ness of the Buddhist should hold sway.
The Moslem and the Idolater may be
honestly converted from the error of
their ways, a votary of Buddha seldom
or never.—Ov. CHINA MAIL.{{< /news/text >}}

Gait, an Indication of
Character.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Observing persons move slow, their
heads move alternately from side to side
while they occasionally stop and turn
round. Careful people lift their feet
high and place them down flat and firm.
Sometimes they stoop down, pick up
some little obstruction and place it quiet-
ly by the side of the way. Calculating
persons generally walk with their hands
in their pockets and their heads slightly
inclined. Modest persons generally step
softly for fear of being observed. Timid
persons often step off from a sidewalk
on meeting another, and always go round
a stone instead of stepping over it. Wide
awake persons "toe out," and have a
long swing to their arms, while they
shake about miscellaneously.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Careless people are for ever stubbing
their toes. Lazy persons scrape about
loosely with their heels, and are first on
one side of the walk and then on the
other. Very strong minded persons have
their toes directly in front of them, and
have a kind of stamp movement. Un-
stable persons walk fast and slow by
turns. Venturous persons try all roads,
frequently climb the fences instead of
going through the gate, and never let
down a bar. One idea persons and very
selfish ones "toe in."—-Cross persons are
apt to hit their knees together.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Good-natured persons snap their fing-
ers every few steps. Fun loving people
have a kind of jig movement.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}"He who would thrive must rise at

{{< news/text >}}He who'd thrive more must rise at

Will rouse him at the stroke of two.{{< /news/text >}}

should be held good that
He who'd never be outdone,

Sharp Advice.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}GENERAL C-—gave his black man,
Sawney, funds and permission to get a
quarter's worth of zoology at a mena-
gerie, at the same time hinting to him
the striking affinity between the Simia
and negro races. Our sable friend soon
found himself under the canvass, and
brought up in front of a sedate-looking
baboon, and eyeing the biquadruped
closely, soliloquized thus:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Folks, sure's your boun; feet, hands,
proper bad countenance, just the nigger
gettin' old, I reckon.” Then, as if seized
with a bright idea, he extended his hand
with a genuine Southern “How d'ye do
uncle?” The ape clasped the negro's
hand and shook it long and cordially.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sawney then plied his new acquain-
tance with interrogations, but eliciting
no replies beyond a knowing shake of
the head or a merry twinkle of the eye,
(the ape was probably meditating the
best way of tweaking the darkey's nose,)
he concluded that the ape was bound to
keep noncommittal, and looking cauti-
ously around, chuckled out: “He, he,
ye too sharp for them, old feller, keep
dark; if ye'd jist speak one word of Eng-
lish, white man have a hoe in yer hand
in less than two minutes.”{{< /news/text >}}

Scotch Minstrels.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}M. D. Conway, in closing a letter to
the ROUND TABLE, from Scotland, says:
It is a considerable compensation for
much discomfort, that one finds every
evening male and female minstrels—
generally a violinist and a woman's voice
—singing sweetly all the Scottish ballads.
These are the only concerts that the peo-
ple have here, and they gather around
these minstrels in large crowds, nearly
all giving a penny or half penny. There
is a woman who sings every evening un-
der our window, who has such a beautiful
voice that I am sure it would have made
her fortune had she been born in Italy.
She sings without ever getting out of
voice, the dear old ballads of her country,
and with an indescribable pathos.—She
is seemingly the daughter of a grey-haired
old man, who goes about with her and
accompanies her voice tenderly with his
violin. She is about twenty years of age,
and has a sweet, homely Scotch lassie's
face, and an unpretending garb. No or-
ator ever moved a crowd more then she
did when last night she sang "Highland
Mary." A fashionably dressed woman
passing with her husband on the street,
had paused to listen to the singing. She
then came forward through the hundreds
who had collected, slipped a coin into the
singer's hand, and then whispered some-
thing in her ear. It was probably a re-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}quest that she should sing "Highland
Mary." At any rate, the minstrel broke
forth with that charming hymn of human
love just blooming into the love divine,
and poured her whole soul into it. Each
note seemed to float up winged into the
moonlight; every noise was hushed all
along the street, and the very surges of
the Frith seemed to pause. As she went
on, many a tear must have been born in
the silence, and many a heart been thrilled.
When it was over nearly every one came
forward with his or her tribute—even the
children with their half pence. Through-
out the country the old ballad tunes and
music of Burns are still sung with ac-
curacy and feeling by the working people.
The fishing people, particularly, sing
them all the day long. I have often had
occasion, roaming about Scotland, to
remember the best thing that George
Gilfillan ever said—that Robert Burns
had set the pulses of human heart to
music.—Lo. Co. News.{{< /news/text >}}

A Chinese Story.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Men cannot conceive of a state of
things so fair that it cannot be realized.
Can any man honestly consult his ex-
perience and say that it is so? Have we
any that facts to appeal to when we say
that our dreams are premature? Did
you ever hear of a man who had striven
all his life faithfully and singly toward
an object and in no measure obtained it?
If a man constantly aspires, is he not
elevated? Did ever a man try heroism,
magnanimity, truth, sincerity, and find
there was no advantage in them? that it
was a vain endeavor? To look at litera-
ture—how many fine thoughts has every
man had! how few fine thoughts are ex-
pressed!—Yet we never have a fantasy
so subtile and etherial, but that TALENT
MERELY, with mere resolution and faith-
ful persistency, father a thousand failures,
might fix and engrave it in distinct and
enduring words, and we should see that
our dreams are the solidest facts that we
know.—THOREAU.{{< /news/text >}}

SIR
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/right >}}
I pray that
{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}you will allow me through J. M. Hood
Esq. U. S. Consul, to come in this way
before you for the purpose of offering
some explanation, and proposing some
amicable settlement of the affair in
which you feel that I have aggrieved
you. After further and careful inqui-
ry I am now inclined to think that
the reports which I made in the Bang-
kok Recorder of the 20th ulto. were
based on some mis-understanding of the
true sense of that part of your con-
versation with His Majesty the king
of Siam relating to H. E. the Prime
Minister.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Siamese government affirms
that there was a great mistake made
in this matter, and there seems to be
collateral evidence that what it affirms
in regard to that point is true—-to wit
-—that you did not demand or even
request that H. E. should be remov-
ed from his place as Premier, but on-
ly that he should be removed from his
post as Chief Commissioner in refer-
ence to the Cambodian Treaty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}For any expressions in the article
with which you feel aggrieved, and
which may not be true, and in regard
to which I have been mis-informed, I
am willing to make all reasonable apol-
ogies and corrections.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Allow me to declare unto you that
my only object in writing that article
was to perform faithfully what I regar-
ded my duty as a public recorder.{{< /news/text >}}

New Year's Compliments.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As this is the last sheet of the Bang-
kok Recorder which we shall issue,
we beg now to return to our subscrib-
ers our sincere thanks for the support
they have given us during the last
year. And to the proprietors of the
numerous exchanges—semi-monthly,
weekly, and semi-weekly, from vari-
ous parts of this eastern world which
they have very generously sent us as
contributions for the support of our
infant enterprise in this great heathen
metropolis, would we herewith tender
our most hearty acknowledgments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our reasons for now leaving this de-
partment of service have already been
given in a previous issue. Though
other cares of a more obligatory char-
acter call us away from the infant
paper, the child we think will not die.
We look upon it as but sleeping
quietly in its cradle, waiting for other
nurses more skillful, we hope, than
ourselves, to come to wake it out of
sleep, and to rear it up to vigorous
manhood. It may be God would have
it nurtured under a different nation-
ality as it might enjoy more freedom
for rapid expansion under the English
flag than the American. If so, His
will be done.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now it remaineth only that we
wish each of our patrons and other
readers and friends a Happy New
Year of probation for an eternal series
of blissful years and cycles in the
kingdom of Heaven.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}As we were going to have no more
opportunity to publish the last chap-
ter of our glances from the Broadway
of Bangkok, we have thought it better
to finish up our original plan even at
the risk of being thought tedious.
We have wished in writing these
sketches not only to give our readers
abroad some accurate knowledge of
this most extraordinary city, but also
to set up some permanent way-marks
as memorials for our successors thirty
years hence, to show them what the
Broadway of Bangkok was in the end
of the year of our Lord 1866, and
what wonderful changes shall have
then passed over the city. We fancy
that all the floating houses will then
have gone into oblivion. That the
banks of this magnificent river flow-
ing on forever, will have been strong-
ly diked, with beautiful streets on
each, and blocks of splendid brick
buildings on the inside of them, all the
distance which we have measured in
our glances. Good streets are now
fast coming into use even in Bangkok,
and when their reign shall have been
fully inaugurated, there can remain
but little more utility for floating
houses. These most singular human
dwellings and mercantile shops doubt-
less came into use because the heath-
en little thought of ever having any
wheel-carriage roads. They scarcely
knew of other pleasure carriages than
boats. And it was indispensable that
their main mercantile shops and vari-
ety stores should be located on the
great thoroughfare of the city, the
most conveniently arranged to invite
customers. Hence the existence of
floating houses where goods all hours
of the day are exposed with the great-
est particularity, and perspicuity, so
that in gliding leisurely along, in
front of them one can usually see the
articles he wants without asking for
them. But the greatest change we
conceive that shall then have taken
place in Bangkok will be that the city
will be a Christian city. O how love-
ly would Bangkok become when ruled
thoroughly by the principles of the
gospel! We hope soon to see this
change from the battlements of heav-
en, when the Lord Jesus shall have
utterly abolished idolatry have as he
has done in the Sandwich Islands.{{< /news/text >}}

A glide up the Broadway
of Bangkok.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
CHAPTER III.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}We propose now to report another
chapter of our glide up the magnific-
ent Menam within the great metro-
polis. We will resume our sail where
we stopped our last report, to wit op-
posite the store of Messrs Malherbe
Jullian & Co. on the eastern side of the
river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The broadway at this point is not
far from a third of a mile wide, ex-
tending nearly north and south, and
is so deep as to admit of the largest
merchant ships lying quite close in
shore.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In passing up northerly from this
starting place, you will see on your
right hand a large one story dwelling
enclosed with bamboo occupied by
Capt. J. Hodgeton proprietor of the
European Steam-tug boat, plying be-
tween the city and the Bar.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next above this comes the Billiard
room of C. Falck lately fitted up by
converting a wooden go-down into a
tasty and lively looking hall, its front
being close to the river, with quite
an inviting landing. Of the opera-
tions of the establishment we know
next to nothing, and cannot hence
safely indulge in any comments, only
so far as to say that we have no sym-
pathy with billiard rooms as we be-
lieve them to be usually conducted for
gambling purposes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing a bamboo go-down in close
contact with the billiard room, a
building having a fearfully combusti-
ble look in this dry time, you come
in front of the dwelling of the Har-
bor Master, an isolated two story
brick edifice, standing between two
long and narrow buildings of the
same hight which face each other
across the front yard of the former.
The one on the lower side is partly
occupied as office rooms for the Har-
bor Master, and the one on the upper
side, is now occupied in part for the
Custom House.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The next object of particular in-
terest on this side is the mouth of the
canal Padoong kroong krasem, excav-
ated early in the present reign. It has
become a place of much business, and
furnishes very many eligible situations
in its extent of two or three miles, for
hand rice-mills, fruit-orchards, gar-
dens, family residences and temples.
It is simply an artificial cut across
the thick neck of a large bend of the
river, and is truly a great internal
improvement upon the last reign.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On passing the mouth of the canal
you next come to the establishment
of Messrs A. Markwald & Co. where
both the * Austrian and Prussian con-
suls display their colors on becoming
flagstaffs, the former on the lower side,
the latter on the upper. The building
is of wood, two stories, large and roomy
and covered with attap palm leaves.
Though of the usual sombre-weather,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}* The Netherlands and Hanseatic Con-
sulatos which we inadvertently omitted to
mention in a previous chapter are both
represented at the Houses of Pickenpack
Thies & Co.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}beaten aspect of nearly all the native
buildings, a little paint in front with
a tasteful arrangement of trees and
shrubbery about it, gives it quite a
European air.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next above this is the dwelling of
R. S. Scott & Co. which is apparently
the twin sister of tho house just be-
fore named. It is here that Denmark
is represented by her consul, and dis-
plays her colors. It was peculiarly
interesting to notice day by day for
these last two years the flaunting en-
signs of three kingdoms whose politi-
cal collisions have made Europe to
quake much of that time, standing
so closely and quietly together, as
though all at home were peace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Glancing a few rods further up
on the same side, you will notice an-
other Roman Catholic church about
the same size, and much in the style
of the one mentioned previously nearly
half a mile below. There is in its
vicinity a large Portuguese settlement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next above this are the Siam Iron
Furnaces, at which all the iron kettles
and other iron vessels of Siamese man-
ufacture are made. The buildings
are now new and chiefly of solid brick
work, it being a great improvement
on what it was before the two great
fires within three years which swept
off a host of old bamboo and attap
sheds and huts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing the Iron works a little, you
come to quite a huddle of native
square-rigged vessels, junks, lighters,
etc. packed close in shore, so as quite
to confound the river view of the
buildings on land. Occasionally you
can get a peek at some of them, but
they are in a state of great heathenish
confusion with scarcely a pleasant
sight for a quarter of a mile or more.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But it is time that we have another
glance on the western side of the
river. As remarked in our previous
report the line of floating houses is
almost unbroken on this side as far as
this northern and southern reach of
the river will allow you to look.
You will notice here and there at
rather long intervals, long brick go-
downs in the rear always extend-
ing inland with one end to the
river. Other parts are thickly stud-
ded with small two story dwellings,
mostly of wood, thatched with attap
leaves, and consequently all of the
same old hay-stack complexion. You
will often see these houses standing
behind one another as it were, from
six to ten in number, all occupying
a space extending along the bank
from ten to twelve rods in width.
And yet among all these you will
scarcely find either in front or in
the rear a street that you could ride
a horse upon. They are nearly all
mere foot paths with the least possible
degree of order. And this state of
things extends for miles up and down
on that side of the river. A little
behind these houses you will see or-
chard trees of rich foliage lifting up
their graceful tops affording an agree-
able relief to the dullness and confus-
ion of heathen houses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sailing up a little further, and
looking to the eastern side again you
will notice a large Wat occupying a
broad frontage on the river, but with
little apparent order or beauty, with
native vessels of all kinds huddled in
front. It is called Wat Sampeng.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing this but a little you come
to the beginning of the Eastern line
of floating houses. And just here the
river takes a turn and extends N. W.
& S. E. You are now three quarters
of a mile from the British Consulate
and a mile and a half below the palace
of the first king. You now see a per-
fect line of floating houses on both
sides of the river until your view is
obstructed a mile above by a turn of
the river to the north. You cannot
but observe that the population of the
eastern side of the river is in this
part of the city much more dense,
and deep inland than the eastern.
With the exception of here and there
a brick house with tiled roof, the
houses are nearly all of wood and
thatched with attap, and hence have a
fearful look of combustibility in a dry
time of two months like the present.
The great Bazar street is about fifty
rods in the rear on this side and passes
nearly parallel with the river. All
the space between it and the river is
intensely packed with small bamboo
and teak-wood attap-thatched houses.
The few brick houses of the same
hight make but little show, as they
are nearly all crowded by old bamboo
huts, hovels, and sheds. Besides here
and there a narrow canal, full of small
boats of merchandize, there is scarce-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ly any access to the Bazar but by the
most cramped and ill repaired foot
paths.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gliding up another half mile you
come opposite to Wat Samplume on
the eastern side. The temple is situ-
ated forty rods from the bank of the
river, having a narrow foot bridge
over a mud-flat of about sixty yards
The chief Pagoda of the temple is
one of the most imposing in the city.
It was in one of its niches that the
late pretended Buddhist miracle was
displayed for many weeks in succes-
sion. This mud flat extends for a
mile or more up and down on that
side, and is closely occupied with
wooden houses standing as it were on
stilts. Their posts, instead of being
framed into sills and these resting on
some suitable under-pinning, are sunk
into the mud from three to five feet,
and the sleepers of the only floor
framed into them is as to be above
the highest tides in December. Hence
you may see, much of the time, an
open space below the floor of six or
eight feet. Such are the houses that
originated and have propagated even
till now the idea abroad, that the
whole of Bangkok is standing on stilts
over vast mud-flats, than which there
was scarcely never a greater mistake.
The cause of this mud-flat about
which we are speaking is simply that
the land on that side has, for scores
of years, been making into the river,
while that on the opposite side has
been wearing away. Aside from
such flats, now on the eastern side, an
now a mile below on the western, the
building sites of Bangkok are on as
good terra firma as in any city in
the world.{{< /news/text >}}

CHAPTER V.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Perplexities excite the mind to think
and devise. It was so with me the
other morning. I went out for an
early walk on business. My way was
on the path by the new canal. I walk-
ed up the side nearest my home and
came to the crossing that must take
me to the other side. A single plank
over the great canal, and high up from
the water and this was slippery. Oh
no! no, said I to myself, I do not wish
a plunge bath from so great a height
this cold morning. I must try some
better way. So I turned backward,
crossed over the fine bridge, went up
the palace road a little, turned down
a path back to the canal and was all
right without any head dizziness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And then I began to think and plan
somthing in this train. Bangkok is a
growing city. It is being rapidly built
up with substantial brick dwellings,
especially on the king's road and vicin-
ity. In this section certainly the city
should be laid out into buildingsquares,
with fine broad streets between the
river and the market street, and be-
tween the market street and the new
road. If the streets could be blocked
out now, it would save a deal of trouble
in after time, in pulling down the old
to make improvements.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A thing may just as well be hand-
somely and conveniently arranged as
otherwise, if time is taken by the fore-
lock. Where do we in Bangkok
propose to have market street a hun-
dred years hence? Where do we
propose to have the beautiful river re-
sidences? What parts are to be given
up for traffic in wholesale? Where are to
be the big warehouses and the din of
trade? And where the forts that are to
give defence? Where the great parade
ground for the military department?
Where the Academy halls? Where the
state buildings in which rulers and
judges are to make laws and dispense
justice? Where those necessary build-
ings that require most thought of all,
that are to provide for the sick, the
sentenced and the unfortunate? Asy-
lums are among the great necessities
of the land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Could these things be planned for,
and roads and streets and groves and
gardens be made with reference to them,
the city would grow up strong and
beautiful, and become e'er long a
beautiful thrifty place for trade, and a
growing thrifty country in every de-
partment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The residence of the Master of police
and that of the Harbor Master seem
the natural boundaries between the old
and the new. The vicinity around
and above and below these points are
destined to great improvements in
coming time. Beginning from the
new iron bridge in the vicinity of the
head station of the master of police,
there is every facility to make a fine
location. Above this point, first is the
river affording beautiful frontage to
fine residences. Cross streets from
this should meet market street, and
then across from market street to
Palace road, and from Palace road to
the canal, till this section should be
filled with substantial brick blocks for
stores and residences.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The section contiguous to the Mas-
ter of police, down the river, seem de-
stined to be Consular squares, where
all foreign residents shall find protect-
ion and justice. It ought therefore to
be distinguished for fine buildings and
most commanding residences. Other
business here, must give place to law
and order and quiet reign, while the
great shall think and plan and devise.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Below the Consulates, business on
a large scale will take the lead, and
whoever passes by on the river will
expect to hear the din of business and
the click of machinery. Down, down
let the march of progress make its way
till the great bend ache with the pro-
duce it bears on its way to the great
ocean, to go forth to supply others
and enrich ourselves.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Already there are a great many
foreign business men clustered below
the Consulates. If all were church
going men, the little Protestant church
would scarcely hold the half of them;
and anon we should see broad found-
ations laid for a towering church, and
the present little unobtrusive structure
become a quiet gathering place for
evening lectures and meetings for con-
ference.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I am astonished that the Chandler
Mansion is not taken up before this,
as a residence of some great business
man, that purposes to command the
point between that and the new
road; and make a great speculation by
buying up and laying out these grounds
to be afterwards sold for advantageous
business purposes and residences.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The opposite side of the river is
better adapted for the native popula-
tion, and therefore affords missionary
stations to those who propose to give
themselves to the moral and religious
advancement of the permanent resi-
dents, the subjects of the kingdom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is at present a path all along
the river. It ought to be a good road,
and easy communication secured both
by water and land all the way up to
the great business land, and from thence
on and on up to Bangkok's No1.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The vicinity of the Wichayen Fort,
the present location of the Mission of
the American Missionary Association,
brings the missionary in communica-
tion with all western inland Siam. It
is at the mouth of the great western
canal between the Chow Phya and
Tachcon, bringing productions from the
west to Bangkok. Boats anchor here
to take their bearings and decide to
what part of the city to take their pro-
duce, and may receive the saving mes-
sage. The missionary here, too, comes
in direct communication with the rulers
and nobility of the country, and there-
fore needs great power and forethought
to turn every event to the best advan-
tage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Presbyterian Mission far down
the river opposite the Chandler Man-
sion, have a fine location for schools
and book making for supplying the
different out-stations they are now plan-
ting with great hope.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Baptist Mission still have their
location where they first commenced
the pioneer station in the rear of the
Portuguese Consulate, now on the
right of H. B. M's Consulate. They
have a Chinese outpost up Market
street in the heart of the Chinese po-
pulation, and a commodious station
on the king's road in the rear of the
English Consulate, which is thronged
with visitors of many nations every
day of the week.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are hopeful for Bangkok at the
present time. We only need faith and
good works, and progress must be
the characteristic in every department.
Shoulder to shoulder, let those who
wish good to this people go forward,
and devising liberal things, each strive
to do his best and emulate each other
to love and good works.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Reform supposes changes. But if
God is at the helm and directs the
whirlwind and guides the storm, when
the storm is over we shall see a good
secured. A man may be driven from
a fine home, but if he thus gets a more
influential position where he can do
more for God and his fellow men, let
him laugh at the storm and welcome
change. What can be done to secure
the greatest good, should be the uni-
versal inquiry, and then press on to
its accomplishment, looking to God
for strength to do, and reward for labor.{{< /news/text >}}

CHAPTER IV.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing up a few rods further, you
will find yourself opposite the mouth
of the old canal which makes a much
shorter cut across the neck of the
bend of the river than the one we
above noticed. The space included
within this and the river is the site of
the city-proper which is enclosed with
a brick wall about 12 feet thick and
not far from the same in length, you
will observe that this canal is packed
with trading boats on both sides, and
nearly every foot of ground occupied
with bamboo and teak-wood houses
as far inland as you can see.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Looking over to the opposite side
of the river, you will have much the
same scenery as we have already
described on that bank below, but
with a greater proportion of substan-
tial brick houses. The line of float-
ing houses is but little broken until
you reach the upper fort on that side
a mile and a half from the Prussian
Consulate. A little below a point op-
posite the canal which forms the
southern and eastern boundary of the
city proper is Mussulman Square. It
is a series of some 18 or 20 Mus-
sulman shops in two long blocks of
two story brick buildings with one
end of each near the river, the other
inland, facing each other over a small
square plot of commons, which is all
ways crowded with lumber in the
greatest confusion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing thence on that side up-
ward some 20 rods you come to a
small and very neat Mahomedan
mosque. And but a few yards above
that, is the mouth of a canal leading
to the mansion of H. E. the late
Somdetch Ongnoi, and to a temple
built by him a little more inland with
a lofty Pagoda.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Ten or fifteen rods above this is
the palace H. E. the late Somdetch
Ongyai, and now occupied by several
members of his numerous family. A
Raymond D. Honey & Co. occupy a
part of it for their variety store of
European goods, and a very eligible
situation it appears to be for their
business.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing upward six or eight rods
further, you come to the residence of
H. E. Chow Phya P'raklang minister
for Foreign affairs. There is nothing
in the least inviting in his front, and
all is rather plain within. H. E. seems
decidedly to prefer expending his
money on Buddhist temples, especial-
ly on the Pra-p'atom monument to
much outlay on his own palace or
personal equipage. He has no children
to claim his care and providence, and
consequently feels quite free to make
such a pious disposition of his
wealth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The next place of note above the
Praklang's; is the landing for the
temple of the late Somdetch Ong-yai.
The temple is 30 or 40 rods from the river.
One of the most lofty pagoda spires
in the city is now being finished on
that temple ground. The wharf and
go-down of the Str. Chow Phya is
next above this landing, and then you
come to the old brick buildings fitted
up for the accomodation of the am-
bassadors from Europe in 1855. It
was, prior to that, denominated the
British Factory, as it was then the on-
ly place in the city where English
merchants did any business. A
few steps above this place is a small
canal which conducts to H. E. Chow
Phya Kalahome's Palace, not far from
a quarter of a mile inland. You can
scarcely discern any part of it as you
glide along in an ordinary pleasure
boat{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We come now on the western side
of the river to a large Portuguese
settlement, commonly denominated
Santa Cruz. Here you will observe
one of the largest Roman C. Churches
in Bangkok built of solid brick work,
and as usual with all the church edi-
fices of this persuasion in Bangkok,
without any spire. There are but two
or three brick dwellings in all the
settlement. One of these is at pre-
sent occupied by the firm of Maherbe
Julian & Co. for both a family dwel-
ling and a variety store. The Por-
tuguese houses generally can scarcely
be distinguished from the dwellings
of the poorer classes of the heathen.
The village was entirely burnt up
two or three years since, and there
does not appear to have been any im-
provement made in the style of the
houses by the rebuilding.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But it is time to turn and note a
few points on the eastern side of the
river. Exactly opposite the wharf of
the Chow Phya is the beautiful man-
sion of Pra Parsee Sombat (Poh-
yim) one of the chief owners of the
Str. Chow Phya, which is getting
herself a great name as a prompt and
fleet mail-boat between this and Sing-
apore. A little below, this is the
landing of Wat Leapa [?] temple situated
some distance from the river and
nearly hidden from view from the
river. Her tall Pagoda, however, is
always commanding. You will here
and there in that vicinity see behind
the dense bamboo and teak houses a
few of the embrasures of the city
wall. Substantial brick houses are per-
haps more frequent in this vicinity
for an extent of a half mile or more
than we found them on either side
below. But they are generally quite
disfigured by a crowd of ugly
bamboo houses, huts, sheds, etc. hid-
ing all about them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Proceeding from Poh-yim's upward
you presently come to the floating
market consisting of a long tier of small
boats with round bamboo covers. They
are fastened to the line of floating houses.
In these are various native commodities
offered for sale—-as dried fish, onions,
potatoes, garlic, red-pepper squashes,
melons, bananas, oranges, pomeloes,
arrow-root, tamarinds, beans, peas,
birdsnests, betelnut, tobacco, etc. Early
every morning a multitude of small
sampans come from all quarters with
other varieties of eatables and offer
them for sale in that vicinity. Immedi-
ately behind this market are several
palaces of princes and nobles; but
there is nothing at all imposing in any
of them excepting the new brick man-
sion of Phya Buroot, which is quite
European in style.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At a point very nearly opposite to
this, on the western side, is the mouth
of the large canal, Bangkok-yai. Im-
mediately below this is temple Kan-
laya which is quite a neat and tasty
establishment. On the upper side of
the canal's mouth is the old fort built
by Weecha-yen about A. D. 1850. And
just behind it, but quite hidden by fruit
trees, is the mission of the American
Missionary Association, and the office
of the Bangkok Recorder. This is a
little more than two miles above the
British Consulate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing on above the fort 8 or 10
rods you come opposite the palace of
H. R. H. Krom Hluang Wongsa on
the west—-the site of king Phya Tak-
sin's palace. And next above this is
Wat Chaang one of the most richly
endowed temples in Bangkok. Its chief
pagoda is about 200 feet high. The
frontage of the temple on the river is
broad, and the court grounds very fine.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Directly opposite to this, on the eas-
tern side is Wat Poh, perhaps richer
than the one just named, but with a
frontage on the river much less impos-
ing. In one of the largest buildings
of this temple is the famous recum-
bent idol 150 feet long and otherwise
well proportioned. Just above this
temple you come to the international
court house, a very respectable brick,
building and quite European in its style.
There are many other brick buildings
going up a little above it, on a place
which has been swept by fire twice or
tree times within the space of five
year. The lines of floating houses on
both sides of the river are quite broken
in this vicinity, by the frontage of
temples and princes' palaces, and this
state of things continues for nearly two
miles above Wat Chaang.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gliding upward a quarter of a mile
from this you will find yourself opposite
the palace of the first king of Siam.
We have no time nor space to attempt
a discription of the place, only to say
that you have a confused sight of many
imposing buildings connected with it,
since large boat sheds and other bam-
boo and brick buildings without little
symmetry or order, stand in front of
them. But it should be stated that
this side of the royal palace, though on
the great Broadway of Bangkok is
not considered the real front. The
true front is inland a quarter of a mile
on the opposite side, where there is a
fine street on terra firma and a very
agreeable and even grand view of the
royal palace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The palace of the late second king
is a half a mile above this on the
same side of the river, and this is dis-
tant from Paknam 23¾ miles and from
the anchorage over the Bar 34 miles.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}We are happy to be able to inform

Shenandoah Captain Goldsborough
arrived at the anchorage, having been
five days on her passage from Singa-

{{< news/text >}}The Shenandoah, of the U. S. Navy
Captain J. R. Goldsborough, was built
at Philadelphia, and launched in 1862.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She cost in her construction up-
wards of one million and a half dollars.
She has a crew of 250 men and offi-
cers, and carries ten guns, two of which
are 11-inch Dahlgrens, the others be-
ing of somewhat less calibre. Her
"ram" is composed of 35 feet of solid
wood and iron, and she is plated for
200 feet over with 5-inch iron. Her
sailing capabilities under steam at sea
are thirteen and a half knots an hour
and the consumption of coal during 48
hours does not exceed 26 tons. She
left Philadelphia in November of last
year and is now on a cruise round the
world. She has already visited the
Cape, Madagascar, Ceylon, and the
coast towns on this side, and she
leaves about the middle of December
for the Straits, China and Japan. The
Shenandoah, it will be remembered,
was at the blockade of Charleston, and
bombardment of Fort Fisher, Wil-

hard fighting. The names of her of-
ficers are as follows:-—J. R. Golds-

Overcoming Temptation.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}One night at a late hour, Dr. Bentley
was disturbed at his studies by a rattling
sound among some wood, which, sawed
and split, had been left by a teamster,
the afternoon previous, too late to be
properly housed. He arose, went cau-
tiously to the window, and saw a woman
filling her apron with wood, which she
hastily carried away. He resumed his
seat, and commenced his study. Shortly
after the same noise occurred; and on
looking out a second time he saw a sim-
ilar operation ; the woman filling her
great apron to the utmost limits of its
capacity. When she was gone, he return-
ed to his book with a tender pity in his
heart for a destitution which sought re-
lief in this lonely, dreary, not to say
sinful manner.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}By-and-by he was startled by a heavy
crash of falling wood, and hurrying up
to the window, beheld the poor woman
casting the very dust of the wood from
her apron. He remained motionless, his
gentle heart filled with commiseration.
She swiftly departed, and soon returned
with the second armful which she threw
on the pile as if it were the “accursed
thing.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The doctor's compassion and curiosity
were now intensely excited. He follow-
ed her retreating figure till he discovered
her residence, and thus ascertained who
she was. What she was, was no mystery
to him. The last hour had shown him
her virtue's lofty height. He called early
the next morning on Mr. B—- the wood-
dealer, and directed him to send half a
cord of his best wood, sawed and split to
Mrs.—-, but by no means to let her know
from whom it came; which was readily
promised. Mr. B-—'s teamster who hap-
pened to be within ear-shot, though out
of sight, was not so bound, and when he
tipped the wood into the poor woman's
yard, replied to her eager inquiry, who
had sent it, by relating the conversation
he had over-heard.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The conscience-stricken mother, feel-
ing that her sin and repentance, in the
lonely darkness of that midnight hour,
were known and understood by another
heart besides her own, hastened without
delay to the house of the benevolent
man, to express her gratitude and her
sorrow, and with deep humility and bit-
terness, told him the temptation to which
her extreme poverty had reduced her of
breaking the eighth commandment.{{< /news/text >}}

The Higher Need.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}What would we think of one who pos-
sessed a rare and beautiful singing bird,
who should lavishly adorn its cage, gild-
ing and burnishing it, and bestowing
tender care on its senseless bars, while
the living, animate object within slowly
perished for want of care and food; or
of another who owned a wonderful jewel
and polished and adorned the casket and
kept it free from spot or stain, while the
diamond within corroded and grew dim
from neglect—-would not such conduct
seem wrong and foolish in the extreme?
yet do we see it daily exemplified in
cases of far greater importance.{{< /news/text >}}

within is dormant, or beats its wings in
silent despair against the beautiful, per-
ishable walls we rear so proudly—-“sits
on forlorn,” and sees the happy estate
God destined it to, recede from it for-
ever, in helpless anguish at our apathy
and frivolous unconcern. Better that the
body should starve, that it should wear
rags and toil in narrow places, if by such
constant friction the soul be kept pure
and bright. If we bend low to carry the
cross, we shall rise higher to wear the

The Victoria falls of the
Zambesi.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the greatest natural wonders of
the world is represented by the Engrav-
ing on page 380, in our Number of this
week. The Mosioatunya (smoke-sound-
ing), or Victoria, Falls of the River Zam-
besi, in the interior of South Africa, have
been known to us since the publication of
Dr. Livingstone's first book of travels,
seven or eight years ago, but were most
completely explored by Mr. James Chap-
man and Mr. Thomas Baines, F. R. G. S.,
when they journeyed across the whole
continent from Walfisch Bay, on the west
coast, by Lake Ngami and the Zambesi,
to the eastern parts, in 1862.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The strangest peculiarity of this aston-
ishing waterfall is the shape of the chan-
nel into which it pours, rushing over a
straight ledge of rock 1900 yards in width.
The elongated chasm, nearly 400 ft. in
depth, formed by a wall of rock directly
opposite and parallel to this ledge, is only
75 yards wide at its narrowest part, and
not more than 180 yards at its widest.
The continuity of this barrier is, at one
place, only broken by a single outlet, 80
yards wide, through which the water es-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}capes into a second chasm, or fissure,
shaped like the first, and parralliel with it,
but only about half the length of the first,
with which it forms an angle. Having by
this passage approached the line of the
right bank of the broader part of the river
above the falls, it makes an extremely
sharp turn to the left hand, and rushes
through a third narrow cut along the wall
of rock that bounds the second chasm on
the other side. It repeats these angular
bendings twice more, though not so acute-
ly and precipitately, before it resumes a
tolerably direct onward course.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The illustration gives a very correct
notion of these fantastic perversions and
distortions of the channel below the falls,
whilst the broad expanse of the river
above the falls, with the beautiful green
islands, some of them full of trees, which
almost seem to hang on the verge of the
cataract, is partially hidden by the lofty
columns of spray, rising often to the height
of 1200 ft. above the bottom of the chasm.
The smooth water above the falls is navi-
gable for canoes, and Garden Island, situ-
ated on the very edge, has been visited by
several English travelers, as by Dr. Liv-
ingstone and Mr. Baines.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The difference in the appearance of
the country," says Mr. Baines, "is marked
and striking. The broad river above the
falls is bordered by palms and luxuriant
tropical vegetation; while along the lower
part of the river the country is dry and
arid, except where fields of maize or millet
are cultivated along the tributary streams,
or where in the rainy season, its barren-
ness is changed to fertility and verdure."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}SOMETHING LIKE a cheese was manu-

Canada, in June last, according to the
particulars of it given by the TORONTO
GLOBE. It weighs 7000 lb., or 3⅓ tons.
It is 6 ft. 10 in. in diameter, 3 ft. thick,
and about 21 ft. in circumference. In the
manufacture of it thirty-five tons of milk
were used. It was made in four days and
a half, kept in press twelve days, then re-
moved and bound together with six large
bands of iron. In a few days the hoops
were removed, and it was wrapped in
cloth and wire, and prepared for removal.
It was taken to New York State Fair, at
Saratoga Springs, in September, and at
the fair many persons wished to purchase
it; but, though so high a price as 6000
dollars was offered for it, Mr. Harris re-
fused to sell. This cheese was to be at

{{< news/text >}}THE legislature of South Carolina has
passed an act securing to the freedmen
the right to make and enforce contracts,
to sue and be sued, to give evidence, to
inherit, purchase, lease, sell real and per-

and equal benefit of personal security,
personal liberty, and private property,
and of all legal remedies, the same as
whites. It further provides for the in-

same offenses upon whites and blacks
alike, and repeals all laws inconsistent
herewith, excepting the law declaring
marriages between whites and blacks
illegal and void.{{< /news/text >}}

Cheap Amusements for
the People.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Therh should be cheap places of resort
for reading and recreation, to draw men
away from the grog shops. I came upon
one such in Glasgow, and visited it. It
is called a workingmen's club. It was on
one of the principal streets of the city.
I paid one penny (two cents) for ad-
mission, and found myself in a suite of
good large apartments, five in number.
The first was a room for social games
without gambling, such as "curling," and
"bagatelle;" the second for chess and
draughts, where the players could be
quiet; the third was a smoking room,
rather dark and gloomy in the day time,
where one man sat alone with his pipe
and his meditations, exciting my pity;
the fourth was a reading room, with nine
different daily papers from London, Edin-
burg, Glasgow, and Manchester, twenty
weekly papers from all over the country
and some twelve or fifteen monthlies and
quarterlies of the most valuable charac-
ter, among which I occupied myself for
some three hours, and the fifth room was
a committee room, and at the service of
any person also who wished to meet a
friend there of an evening for any brief
business. No intoxicating drinks are
allowed. Now, a workingman has all this
(open from 9 a. m. till 10 p. m.) for a
dollar and a quarter a year, or for twelve
and a half cents a month, or for two
cents a single admission! If there were
fifty or a hundred such establishments in
every city, would it not save money from
the liquor saloons?—LETTER FROM DR.

{{< news/text >}}TO TAKE WHITE MARKS FROM MA-
HOGANY.—-If a white mark has been left
on a mahogany table by carelessly sitting
down on it a vessel of hot water, rub the
place hard with a rag dipped in lamp-oil;
and afterwards pour on a little cologne
water, or a little alcohol, and rub it dry
with a clean rag. The dish-marks left
on a dining table, can, of course, be taken
off in the same manner. If brandy is spilt
on mahogany, and leaves a whitish mark,
that mark can he removed by rubbing it
hard with a rag dipped in more brandy.

{{< news/text >}}Grace does not permit us to check
ourselves through to Heaven, but to get

while in view of God's might, we know
we can never fall, in view of our weak-

"Simplicity of Greatness," says : "Who-

been charmed with his genial, artless
candor, and his unrestrained flow of gen-

the unaffected repose of perfect cultiva-

and his cordial interest in everything
that is interesting to man."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Aytoun, the laird of Kinaldiz,
was particularly indifferent respecting
his attire, but was noted for his powers
both of compliment and banter. Walk-

acquaintance whom he saluted with his
usual courtesy. "Good morning, madam;
how well you are looking to day?" "I'm
sorry I can't return the compliment," re-

ness of his apparel. "Poh," said Mr.
Aytoun, "you might have lied as I did."{{< /news/text >}}
