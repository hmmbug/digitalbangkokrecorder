BANGKOK MAY 1st.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We can scarcely bring ourselves to real-
ize that this is the second issue of our se-
cond quarter. Time flies rapidly even with
the monotony of Bangkok. The encourag-
ment we have received in our enterprise has
surpassed our expectations, for which we re-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}turn our heartfelt thanks. We are still how-
ever a rebel, unacknowledged by the "pow-
ers that be" in the "Fourth Estate" in Siam, 
and denied even the courtesy of a friendly 
exchange, but although ourselves opposed 
to rebellion, in this instance we are thank-
ful to the community for granting us "bel-
ligerant rights," If we have failed in any 
way to fulfil our promise, we are ready to 
make all due acknowledgment, and promise 
in future to try and do better. {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We know that it is difficult to meet the 
tastes of all even in so small a community, 
as this. Some like short pithy articles,—-
others like them long and prosy. Some 
like business and statistics all the time,
whilst others would turn aside occasionally 
from business and amuse themselves with 
something rich and racy. Some desire to 
know more about the country, whilst others 
consider themselves sufficiently well inform-
ed upon that subject. Amidst all this 
diversity of taste it is difficult to steer a 
direct course. {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are thankful however that we have 
as yet heard no very loud complaints. We 
are still ready to receive subscriptions and 
advertisements. The Siamese has been 
separated from the English and enlarged, 
and is also open for advertisements. Auction
sales and all other advertisements will be 
translated, for, and inserted in the Siamese 
department on reasonable terms.{{< /news/text >}}

TUILERIES.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 63.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first additions to the Tuileries as
left by Catharine de Medicis were made in
the beginning of the 17th century in the
reign of Henry IV. This king erected the
the two immense Pavillions which now form
the terminations of the Palace, North and
South. These works appear to have been
only completed under the reign of his suc-
cessor Louis XIII, and he was the first of
the French Kings who made the Tuileries
his residence. It was also in his reign that
the Tuileries was for the first time enclosed
within the city walls. Louis XIV made
several alterations and improvements in the
building. He also repaired and greatly
ornamented the interiors of the Palace,
having like his predecessors made it his
usual residence, till that of Versailles was
finished in 1702. The gallery which con-
nects the Tuileries with the Louvre was
mostly built in the reign of Henry IV, but
he left it, like many other of his great works,
in an unfinished state. The garden front of
the Truileries, heavy and incongruous as it
is, when analyzed by architectural taste,
is unrivalled as a scene of artificial beauty.
The eye ranges over broad terraces crowd-
ed with a pleasure loving population,
walls interspersed with flower gardens, and
fountains, and shady groves, where some
antique statue is encountered at every turn.
From the central pavilion the prospect is
uninterrupted for a distance of several miles,
and is terminated by the grand arch of the
Barriere de Neuilly. The Southern terrace
is bounded by the quays and the river, and
the northern by the splendid buildings of
Rue de Rivoli from which stretch the garden
is separated not by a dark wall but by a
handsome open railing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}No one can fail to see that whatever the
French people may have wanted in real
political freedom, the out door pleasure of
the people have ever been abundantly con-
sulted even by their most arbitrary mon-
archs. And there can be no doubt that
it was this freedom of access to objects of
taste, and beauty, which alone made
the old regime endurable. The people in
some degree participated in the pride of
the monarch, and thus his splendor veiled his
oppression. The respect which the French
pay to the monuments of art, in which the
humblest Frenchman peasant feels a pride and
an individual honour, presents a humili-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ating contrast to the barbarous mutilations,
which some even of those who pretend to
refinement amongst Englishmen, inflict on
works of taste of which they are occasion-
ally permitted to have a glimpse by the pos-
sessors. The reason is evident. We have, un-
til late years, had so few institutions which
offer such freedom of access as the gardens
of the Tuileries and the superb gallery of
the Louvre. The people of the lower orders
have had no public property to respect, and
they are therefore deficient in that branch
of national education. Even the monuments
of our illustrious dead are closed against
them, except on the payment of contempt-
able fees, and under the watch of an igno-
rant exhibitor. This evil is being somewhat
remedied however, within the last few
years.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Till the reign of Louis XIV the gardens
of the Tuileries continued to be separated
from the Palace by a street, as in the time
of Catharine de Medicis. About the year
1665 Louis committed the charge of entire-
ly remodeling the grounds to his celebrated
gardener Lenotre, and the result was its
metamorphosis into the same general ap-
pearance which it now presents. It has
since that time however undergone many
partial restorations. It had suffered con-
siderable injury during some of the turbu-
lent days of the revolution; but as early as
the end of 1796 the government, justly
proud of so magnificent an ornament of their
capital, commenced the reparation of the
damage it had sustained on the most liberal
scale; and the works were continued for
several years till the place had more than
regained its ancient splendor. After the
accession of Bonaparte to the supreme
power additions were made to its former
embellishments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The gardens of the Tuileries and of Ver-
sailles have always been accounted the chief
monuments of the genius of Lenôtre, and
indeed the finest specimens in the world of
their peculiar style of disposition and em-
bellishment. Lenôtre was born to be a court
artist, or as he was called "Lejardinier
des Rois." His passion for the dignified
and grand, was both the inspiration in
which he wrought, and the coloring prin-
ciple of his ordinary thoughts and feelings.
But the grandeur which he loved and ad-
mired was that of the artificial rather than
the natural. Still he was a sincere enthu-
siast and even as courtier his heart prompt-
ed the expression of his lips. Accordingly,
in the spirit of courtly admiration and re-
verence, Lenôtre sometimes forgot the con-
ventional forms which regulate the approach
to princes. Having gone on one occasion
to visit Rome he was admitted by Pope In-
nocent XI to the honor of a special au-
dience. When about to take leave, delighted
with the reception he had received, he ex-
claimed in the pride and gratitude of his
heart; "I care not now how soon I die I
have beheld the two greatest men on earth,
your Holiness and the King, my master."
"Alas" replied the Pope, "there is a great
difference between us—the King is a great
prince renowned for many virtues—I am but
a poor priest, the servant of the servants of
God." (very different words from those of his
present Most August Holiness) "he is young
and I am old." On these words the honest
Lenotre, slapping His Holiness heavily on
the shoulder rejoined " My Reverend Father,
you are in excellent health and will live to
see all the secret college under ground."
The Pope could not restrain himself but
laughed aloud. On which Lenotre in his joy
actually threw his arms around the neck of
His Holiness and pressed him to his bosom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All his veneration for Louis himself did
not prevent him from sometimes accosting
him too, in the same cordial fashion. It is
to the credit of the "Grand Monarque"
that he bore these freedoms with great good
humor. On one occasion on his waiting
on his Royal master to detail to him the
different parts of his plan for the formation
of the Park and Garden at Versailles, Louis,
struck with admiration at the taste and
genius which the artist displayed in his con-
trivances, for surmounting the many difficul-
ties of the nature of the ground, three times
interrupted his discourse with the exclaima-
tion " Lenotre, I give you for that 20,000
francs." When this munificence however
was repeated for the fourth time, Lenotre
stopped the King, saying—"Sire, your Majes-
ty shall hear no more, I should ruin you were
I to go on." Formerly access to the gardens
of the Tuileries from the place Louis XV
was by the Pont Tournant or draw bridge,
which was constructed in 1717. Peter the
Great of Russia who was in Paris at the
time, used to take great delight, it is related,
in watching the progress of the men em-
ployed in constructing this bridge. The
ditch or moat over which it afforded a
passage still remains, but since the re-
volution, a stone bridge has been substituted
for the Pont Tournant. The old bridge is
famous in the revolution of 1879. The most
interesting and important associations in the
History of France are connected with that
wonderful series of events which effected an
entire change in the destinies of nations
and the general aspect of the world.{{< /news/text >}}

AMERICAN GENERALS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 68)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gen. H. W. Halleck was another of
General Scott's favorites, and upon the
death of Gen. Lyon in Missouri, who bid
fair to be a star of the first magnitude, and
the failure of Freemont, Halleck was sent
to take command of that department. He
did up his work well, was present in per-
son at the seige of Corinth and forced
Beauregard to evacuate that place without
a battle.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When President Lincoln discovered that
he and Secretary Stanton were not the
men to direct the operations of the armies,
upon the recommendation of Scott, Hal-
leck was called to Washington and made
General-in-chief. He soon proved however,
that he was not pre-eminently qualified for
the position. He carried out the old boa-
constrictor plan recommended by Scott, of
engirdling the rebellion and choking it to
death.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His first act was to recall McClellan from
the Peninsula, against which the latter pro-
tested, and the correspondence between
them clearly proves that if McClellan was
not equal to his superior as a strategist, he
certainly was far ahead of him in a literary
point of view.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His second act was to place his favorite
John Pope in command in Virginia, who
did two remarkable things, viz, he issued to
the army a most ridiculous address in which
he discarded all “lines of retreat,” and in
a few weeks he destroyed a fine army.
When Congress revived the old rank of
Lieutenant General, and conferred that honor
upon Grant, Halleck was naturally cast in-
to the shade, and now holds the merely
ornamental title of chief of the President’s
staff.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Freemont had acquired quite a reputa-
tion as an explorer, and “path-finder” in the
west. He was also a rabid abolitionist. He
was brought forward in 1856 by the Re-
publican party, then in its infancy, as a
candidate for the Presidency. He was de-
feated by Buchanan, although he ran a
higher ticket than was generally anticipated
by his friends. When the rebellion broke
out he was in Europe, but he hastened
home, and offered his services to the gov-
ernment. His services were accepted by
the government, but on account of his pre-
vious influence, they at once foolishly rais-
ed him to the rank of Major General in the
regular army. After the death of Lyon,
Freemont was sent to the department of the
Missouri, where he spent a long time in
making vast preparations. A personal feud
existing between him and General Frank
P. Blair, he was arraigned by Blair in
Washington as incompetent, and was soon
afterwards superseded by Halleck. He was
afterwards cleared by a court martial and
was soon after entrusted with another com-
mand in Virginia. He was the first of our
Generals who succeeded in first attacking
General Stonewall Jackson which he did,
but was obliged to come off second best
in the engagement. His department was
afterwards enlarged and the whole com-
mand given to Gen. Banks. Freemont hol-
ing a higher rank than Banks would not
be under him and consequently retired.
This ended his military career. It almost
certain that he has not the comprehen-
siveness necessary to constitute a successful
general, but it is to be regretted that the
government did not give him a better op-
portunity of showing what he could do. 
Through hatred for Mr. Lincoln he accepted
the nomination of the ultra abolition party
for president in 1864, but for the sake of
the country he wisely withdrew before the
election{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The efficiency of the army of the Potom-
ac was for a time very much crippled by the
constant changing of its commanders. Af-
ter the removal of McClellan, Burnside was
appointed to command the army. Accord-
ing to reports he had refused the command
once before, when the army was about to
follow Lee into Maryland. Obeying the
commands of his superior General Halleck,
he rapidly followed Lee into Virginia, but
soon met a severe reverse at Fredericksburg
He lacked confidence in himself, for so
large a command, and frankly acknowled-
ged it. Through jealousy too, or some
other motive some of his subordinates
manifested a lack of confidence in him. Af-
ter Fredericksburg he resiged the com-
mand. His previous career in North
Carolina was brilliant, and so was his sub-
sequent career in East Tenessee. With a
small army or a subordinate command he
is doubtless a model general, but acknow-
ledges his inability for a large command.
The country has had few more faithful ser-
vants than A. E. Burnside.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Hooker who had been most clamorous
against Burnside for incompetency, was
next elevated to the command. He manoeu-
vered around during the winter and upon the
opening of the spring campaign met the
rebels at Chancelorville. The only benefit
to the government resulting from that bat-
tle was the killing of General Stonewall
Jackson, than whom, Gen. Lee said, he
would rather have lost a regiment. After
allowing Lee to run around him and invade
Maryland and Pennsylvania, Hooker saw
that he had the confidence neither of the
army nor the people and he resigned. He
is undoubtedly a fighter, and as a division
commander has probably no superior in
the army. He however is somewhat of a
braggodocio, and has not the calibre for
a large command. He was afterwards
sent to Chatanooga under Grant where he
did excellent service. His driving the re-
bels from Lookout Mountain is one of the
most daring affairs of the war. When Mc-
Pherson was killed Howard was raised to
the command of the army of Tennessee at
which Hooker seemed to be displeased and
resigned his command. He is now in com-
mand at Cincinnati, which is virtually being
laid upon the shelf. {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After Hooker resigned Gen. George G.
Meade who was in command of one of the
divisions of the army was promoted to the
command. Four days after his appoint-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ment he met Lee's victorious and invading
army at Gettysburg, and after three days
hard fighting gained a signal victory.
Meade has few superiors any where as a
field commander, and is still in command
of the army of the Potomac, but by the
constant presence of Grant he is thrown
somewhat into the shade.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
CHIENG MAI TRIP
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 66)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lampoon is the last city before reaching
Chieng-Mai. We called soon after our ar-
rival on the Palat, who made known our
arrival to the Governor and procured an
interview for us. He received us very
cordially with all of his P'ayas and officers
as low before him as if he were King of
Siam, or sovereign of all the Indies. He
is, by the way, a man of as much stamina
of character about him, as any that I have
met among the Eastern officials. He is about
the ordinary height with prominent features.
There is an air of authority about him that
seems to be natural, without rendering him
haughty or ridiculous.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We were put through the ordinary rout-
ine of questions as to our errand to Chieng-
Mai, as well as all about the outside coun-
try. We had before asked the Palat, as a
special favor, to assist us in getting off the
next morning. To him it seemed simply
impossible to hunt up the elephants and
make the necessary preparations. Before
leaving the Governor's we made the same
request, supported by the argument that
one of our number was suffering under a
little indisposition, which rendered it desire-
able that we should hasten to our journey's
end. He told us yes, that he would be
happy to have us spend several days there,
but if we urged it there would be no dif-
ficulty, and spoke to P'aya Sanam to have
all in readiness. He began to hesitate a
little that the time was short to hunt up
the elephants. "Why not" said the Gover-
nor with an air of authority that left no
room for reply, "how many elephants have
you of your own?" "Seven" was the reply,
"Well then they only need four, have them
off punctually in the morning without fail."
There was no appeal, and he left immedi-
ately to make preparation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lampoon is smaller in size than Lakawn
having a population estimated at about ten
thousand. Its walls are circular instead of
square; we walked round them before
breakfast. I think the whole circuit can-
not be more than two and a half or three
miles. We paid a hurried visit to the
market also, the first regular one that we
had met after leaving Bangkok. Our men
thought it was fine to get to a market town
again. That, with a short visit to wat
Hluang, was about all that we could do in,
stop at this city. Its tall spire shaped
not unlike wat Chaang at Bangkok, presen-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ted a find appearance as it glistened in the
sun at a distance. It is a very fine wat,
though, as is often the case, the workman-
ship does not bear close inspection.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After breakfast our elephants were in
readiness, and we were off in fine spirits
on our last day's ride to the Laos capital.
For the rest of the journey, and also for a
detailed description of the place itself, I
must refer to the published account of "a
visit to Xiengmai, the principal city of the
Laos, or Shan states—By Sir Robert H.
Schomburgh. &c. &c." which most of your
Bangkok readers have doubtless seen. I did
not see it till after our return, but have found
it substantially correct.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our road in the morning was through
one of the largest and finest rice fields
I ever saw. It is several miles across it,
extending in some places nearly as far as
the eye can reach. The people were then
all engaged in gathering in a bountiful
harvest. Our road lay most of the way a-
long the Ping fork, as the prefix quaa
implies, and along a large canal dug for
the purpose of irrigating the plain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The walls of Chieng Mai did not appear
till near sunset, and we had still to cross a
wide plain of rice fields, so that it was near-
ly dark when we arrived at the royal sala.
It was to late for our arrival to be known
that night; but before breakfast in the
morning we were visited by one or two of
the head men of the city, to ascertain who
we were, and what our errand was, and to
invite us to visit Chow Rat-bokee, who was
left in supreme command while the prince
was on a visit to Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As we met two other messengers on our
way, we hardly knew whether to be flat-
tered at the honor paid us, or alarmed at
their suspicions. But whatever fears we
might have had were allayed by the kind
reception given us. We had met some of
the head men before, and the prince him-
self at Bangkok, which served for an in-
troduction, and the announcement that we
were missionaries, was a guarantee even in
that distant province that our mission was
a peaceful one. Our reception and whole
treatment while there was about all that we
could have asked. It was probably better
than it would have been, had not the diffi-
culty mentioned in the narrative referred
to above, compelled some of those in
authority there, to make a visit to Bangkok
which caused them considerable trouble.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Chow Rat-bokee was absent in the coun-
try most of the time while we were there,
so that we saw but little of him afterwards.
But there seemed to be a general determina-
tion that no difficulty should be allowed
to grow out of our visit. The princes'
head-wife sent a man every morning to see
if all our wants were supplied, and his
daughter with a large train of attendants
made us a call, in the mother's name, bring-
ing us presents of various kinds, and P'aya
Sa-yám who was intrusted with seeing our
wants supplied was very attentive.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}No hindrance whatever was placed in
our visiting the city or talking to the peo-
ple. Owing to some little sickness, occa-
sioned by our long trip and change of
water, we could not avail ourselves as fully
of this privilege as we desired.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}For regularity of plan and neatness of
the streets, and good order and respectful
behavior of the people, I have seen no
place in Siam that can compare with it,
while its aqueduct supplying the whole city
with water at their doors, brought from a
mountain two or three miles distant, might
indicate even a higher degree of civilization
than it can claim.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The market which is a very large one is
as neat and as orderly as any to be found
in any country. It is open in the morning
till about nine o'clock, and before day
break you could hear the stir of preparation
for it. The bridge near which our sala was
situated, poured forth a constant stream of
both buyers and sellers, all wending their
way with eager steps towards it. Our first
morning there, we almost involuntarily fell
into the crowd to see where such a mass
of people were going. It led us within the
city walls and soon the market appeared.
It is kept entirely by women, who seat them-
selves on the ground, with vegetables, and
fruit, and Laos confectionaries, deposited on
one of natures simple stalls, in the form of a
large plantain leaf or in little baskets made
by themselves, before them. While not
trading, they work away on their embroid-
ery which is used for their clothing and
pillows, and matresses. They use but few
words in buying and selling, very unlike
the Siamese, who expect to fall one fourth,
or one half from the price they ask. It
seemed strange to us to see salt used as
the currency or circulating medium of the
market. So seldom is money used that we
found that the owners of the articles, often
had no idea of the price of their own goods
in money, while they could readily answer
if they were asked how they would laak,
it, or how much salt they would take for
it. This arises from its distance from
Bangkok, and the rapids in the river, rend-
ering the importance of such a heavy, and
essential article as salt very expensive. The
next greatest want in the estimation of the
Siamese is fish. Though pork and fowls
should be ever so abundant and cheap, they
cannot understand how there can be good
living without fish.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What strikes one as most novel, and
peculiarly Laos too in this part of Asia, is
the immense number of elephants and
droves of oxen referred to in a former letter.
Besides the oxen we see hundreds of ele-
phants daily, in droves from two to thirty
or forty. When the prince goes off, he is
accompanied by a train of two or three
hundred. The thorough manner in which
they go to work to break in the young ones
is remarkable. They afford about as good
a specimen of the rigid school of family
discipline as could be found. I have seen
the feet tied in pairs and the body suspen-
ded by two large ropes to a beam above, so
that his feet just touches the ground, while
the poor animal was most unmercifully
speared and pounded, till he was covered
with blood and scars. He is then let down
and if he is not thoroughly subdued, he is
returned to his place and the process re-
peated. But when his lesson is once learn-
ed it is learned well, and he becomes as
submissive as he is intelligent. One might
almost suppose that the people are put
through a similar process of training, for they
are certainly very civil. The laws are very
rigid as theft is a capital crime. But while
the people respected their prince they did
not speak of him as tyrannical. Any de-
tailed account of the dress and manners and
customs of the people, would be an old stale
subject, which no one would care to have
repeated. But the scenery on the river
thence to Ra-haáng on our return route, was
entirely new to foreigners, and almost un-
surpassed for beauty, with a short notice of
which some other time, I will close.{{< /news/text >}}

LETTERS FROM GEN. LEE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/right >}}
N. Y. Observer.
{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following letters from Gen. Lee,
written soon after the outbreak of the Rebel-
lion, have just been made public:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Arlington, Va., April 20, 1861.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}General:—-Since my interview with you
on the 18th inst, I have felt that I ought
not longer to retain my commission in the
army. I, therefore, tender my resignation,
which I request you will recommend for
acceptance. It would have been presented
at once, but for the struggle it has cost me
to separate myself from a service to which
I have devoted all the best years of my life
and all the ability I possessed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}During the whole of that time-—more
than a quarter of a century—-I have exper-
ienced nothing but kindness from my super-
iors, and the most cordial friendship from
my comrades. To no one, General, have
I been as much indebted as to yourself for
uniform kindness and consideration, and it
has always been my ardent desire to merit
your approbation. I shall carry to the grave
the most grateful recollections of your kind
consideration, and your name and fame will
always be dear to me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Save in defence of my native State, I
never desire again to draw my sword. Be
pleased to accept my most earnest wishes
for the continuance of your happiness and
prosperity, and believe me, most truly
yours,        {{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Lieut.-Gen. Winfield Scott, Commanding
United States Army.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A copy of the foregoing letter was in-
closed in the following letter to a sister of
the General's, Miss A. M.:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Arlington, Va., April 20, 1861.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}My Dear sister:—I am grieved at my
inability to see you. * * * I have been
waiting "for a more convenient season,"
which has brought to many before me, deep
and lasting regret, Now we are in a state
of war which will yield to nothing. The
whole South is in a state of revolution, in-
to which Virginia, after a long struggle,
has been drawn, and though I recognize
no necessity for this state of things, and
would have forborne, and pleaded to the
end for redress of grievances, real or sup-
posed, yet in my own person I had to meet
the question, whether I should take part
against my native State. With all my
devotion to the Union, and the feeling of
loyalty and duty of an American citizen,
I have not been able to make up my mind
to raise my hand against my relatives, my
children, my home. I have, therefore, re-
signed my commission in the army, and,
save in defence of my native State, with
the sincere hope that my poor services may
never be needed, I hope I may never be
called on to draw my sword.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I know you will blame me, but you must
think as kindly of me as you can, and be-
lieve that I have endeavored to do what I
thought right. To show you the feeling
and struggle it has cost me, I send a copy
of my letter to Gen. Scott, which accom-
panied my letter of resignation. I have no
time for more. * * * May God guard
and protect you and yours, and shower
upon you every blessing, is the prayer of
your devoted brother, {{< /news/text >}}

Emperor of the French, translated from 
a Siamese copy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}An agreement to articles of a Treaty
made by Chow-Phya-Sri-Sooriwongs, Prime
Minister, in the name of Prabat Somdet
Pra Chow King of Siam on the one part,
and Monsieur Aubaret Consul of the French,
Officer of the Legion of Honor &c,-—in the
name of H. I. M. Napoleon Emperor of the
French on the other part.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Siamese government on the one
part, and the French government on the
other part, do hereby mutually agree and
determine, how the Cambodian affair touch-
ing the Treaty with the French, which was
made on the 27th July of the 8th moon,
Siamese civil era, corresponding with the
Christian era 11th August, 1863, shall be
arranged and settled.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From this time forward the two govern-
ments aforesaid, are mutually agreed to re-
scind that which causes trouble and embar-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}rassment in the working of the existing
Treaty of amity, and friendship between the
two parties. Hence the two governments
do hereby agree and settle upon the adop-
tion of the seven following articles:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ARTICLE I. Prabat-Somdet-Pra-Chow
King of Siam, consents to make public the
agreement of the Emperor of the French
for the protection of the kingdom of Cam-
bodia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ARTICLE II. The Treaty which the gov-
ernment of Siam made with the government
of Cambodia, in the month of December
1863 cannot [henceforth] be used, and must
be accounted vain and nugatory. As re-
gards the Siamese, they shall not be allow-
ed to put into force any article of that
Treaty whatsoever.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ARTICLE III. The Emperor of the
French is willing that the kingdom of Cam-
bodia shall have Sovereign power within
itself, being Independent of, and unan-
nexed to any other power. Consequently
the Emperor of the French doth hereby
engage that he will not take any part of
the kingdom of Cambodia and annex it to
his possessions in Cochin China.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ARTICLE IV. The boundary lines of
the Provinces of Battambong, Nak'awn-
Siam - ap, together with the Laos provinces
belonging to Siam, bordering on the king-
dom of Cambodia, the French agree shall
remain as they are at the present time sup-
posed to be fixed. The Cambodians shall
not cross over and commit trespass in any
of these provinces of the Siamese, nor shall
the Siamese go over and commit trespass
within the borders of the Cambodians.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to the boundary lines between Siam
and Cambodia, the Siamese and Cambo-
dian governments, shall each send her offic-
ers to survey and mark the lines anew, as
they are at the present time understood to
be fixed. And there shall be men appointed
by the French government to go and wit-
ness such surveys.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ARTICLE V. The kingdom of Cambo-
dia must remain a Sovereign and Indepen-
dent State unannexed to any other. She
shall be a kingdom between the French on
the one hand, and the Siamese on the oth-
er. But in consequence of an old cus-
tom now existing, the king of Cambo-
dia shall continue to send his ambassador
to pay his respects [from time to time] to
the king of Siam, and he shall also send
such ambassadors to pay his respects [oc-
casionally] to the Emperor of the French.
This shall be considered simply as a becom-
ing respect paid to said governments, and
not at all with any evil intent or influence
against the Independence and Sovereignty
of Cambodia. Should the king of Cambo-
dia send presents to the king of Siam,
as he has been accustomed to do and the
Siamese and the Cambodians continue to
have intimate and friendly intercourse, this
the French government will not forbid.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ARTICLE VI. The king of Cambodia
having been accustomed to reside [at times]
in Siam, the French government will not
interfere with the continuance of that cus-
tom. And on the other hand if the king
of Cambodia shall wish to go and reside
[a while] in France, the Siamese govern-
ment will interpose no obstacle to it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ARTICLE. VII. The French government
agree to require the Cambodians to observe
every one of the above articles, and has
caused them to be written in the Siamese
and the French languages—both copies be-
ing of the same tenor and date.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This Treaty was signed and sealed, both
the Siamese and the French copies, at Bang-
kok on Friday the 5th month and 4th day

AMERICA
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Military operations have resumed their
former prominence in the news from the
Federal States, and the whole interest turns
upon strategic movements, reconnaissance,
reinforcements, and expected battles. Dur-
ing the 10 days preceding the 8th of Feb.
the armies under Sherman and Grant had
received important accessions of strength
from those of the West, especially from
that under Thomas. General Grant’s army
appears to be no longer mud-bound, for a
forward movement against Lee’s right was
announced. On the morning of the 5th
of February the 5th corps, preceded by
Gregg’s cavalry moved towards Reams
Station, encountering cavalry on the road,
who retreated before the Federal advance.
At noon they reached Rownty Creek, over
which they constructed a bridge. The 3rd
Pennsylvanian cavalry were then sent out
to make a connection with the 2nd corps,
two divisions of which had gone out on the
Vaughn Road as far as Hatcher’s Run, to
demonstrate in that direction. On reach-
They advanced a mile across the Run,
driving the Confederate pickets before
them. Here the Federals erected a strong
line of breastworks, making their position
perfectly secure, and the connection be-
tween both corps was afterwards formed.
The second division of the 2nd corps, be-
fore reaching Hatcher’s Run, turned to the
right, and advancing in a north-westerly
direction, found the enemy in a strong
position in the vicinity. The Federals
having thrown up a line of breastworks,
the Confederates made several charges, and
attempted to break through them, but were
repulsed. The Federals captured a large
commissariat train. Their loss was about
100 men. On the following morning, the
6th, the third division of the 5th corps ad-
vanced along the road leading from Duncan-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}road towards Boydton Plank Road, driving
the Confederates from their breastworks at
Dabney's Mills. In the afternoon the Con-
federates made a determined attack along
the whole line, expecting to break through
or cut off the third division. Simultaneous-
ly they made an attack in front, and part
of the third division, being cut off from
communication, gave way and retreated in
disorder to the breastworks erected by the
2nd corps. Part of the third division of
the 6th corps, which had just crossed Hat-
cher's Run, and become demoralized, were
rallied, and assisted in driving the enemy
back. The Federals, during the retreat,
abandoned two artillery waggons. Shortly
afterwards the Confederates attacked the
left of the 2nd corps near Armstrong House,
on Duncan Road, but were repulsed with
loss. The Federals lost on Sunday and
Monday, the 5th and 6th, 1180 men. On
Tuesday, the 7th, they occupied the ground
lost on the previous day. Grant's permenent
lines extended from what was formerly the
extreme left at Fort Cummings, or Squir-
rel Level-road, to across Hatcher's Run, at
Armstrong Mills.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}General Lee's report states that on Sun-
day, the 5th, the Federals moved a strong
force to Hatcher's Run, Part of his infantry
crossed and proceeded to Cattail Creek,
and the cavalry to Dinwiddie Courthouse,
where they encountered the Confederate
cavalry and retired. In the afternoon Hall's
and Gordou's troops demonstrated against
the Federals on the left of Hatcher's Run,
near Armstrong Mills, but finding them
entrenched, withdrew during the night.
The force which advanced beyond the
Creek was reported recrossing. On Mon-
day morning, the 6th, Pegram's division
moved to the right bank of the Creek to
reconnoitre, when it was vigorously attack-
ed by the Federals. The battle was ob-
stinately contested for several hours; but
Pegram being killed, and Colonel Hofman
wounded, some confusion occurred, and
the division was pressed back to its original
position. Van's division was ordered to
support Pegram's, and charged the Federals,
forcing them back, but was in turn compel-
led to retire. Mahoney's division then
arrived, and drove the Federals rapidly to
their defences at Hatcher's Run. The Con-
federate loss is small, and the enemy's loss
is not supposed to be great.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sheridan's cavalry had defeated a detach-
ment of Confederate cavalry at Moorfield,
Virginia, capturing 20 prisoners, including
Major Harry Gilmer.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nothing direct had been received from
General Sherman down to the 11th of Feb.
The progress of his movements into the
interior of South Carolina was furnished by
Confederate telegrams. They state that on
the 1st of February the advance of what
was supposed to be a heavy force of Federal
troops reached Whippy Swamp, a point
within 30 miles of Branchville, where the
Confederate cavalry were driven in. A
column of Sherman’s cavalry was said
to be moving rapidly on the Augusta roal,
upon some unknown point. The Confeder-
ates were confident Sherman was moving
on Branchville. Heavy skirmishing within
20 to 30 miles of Charleston is reported,
and it was said that the Federals came up
to Young’s Island in barges on the 1st of
February. landed, drove in the pickets,
and fired a number of buildings on the
plantations. Three steamers were reported
off White’s Point, on the Combabee River,
on the same day, with troops, who were
making attempts to land. A report pre
vailed at Richmond that Sherman had effect
ed a lodgement on the railroad between
Branchville and Augusta. The only thing
confirmatory of this report was that the
telegraphic communication with Augusta
was interrupted. There were also rumours
that Branchville had been flanked and cap
tured, growing out of the receipt of news
by the War Department that the Confeder-
ate advance guard under M'Law had fallen
back within 30 miles of Branchville through
fear of being enveloped by the Federal’s
advance. Augusta papers report two corps
of Sherman’s army to be on the Georgia
side of the Savannah River.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}General Beauregard had assumed the
command of the forces at Augusta, where
be declared that be would fight to the bitter
end, and if he failed he could pay his
passage to a foreign country,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Hood’s army is said to be at St. John.
One of his army corps is reported to have
left for South Carolina. A large Confeder-
ate force is reported on the Arkansas side
of the Mississippi, near Mound City, per
paring to cross into Tennessee.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Important intelligence, of the dates of the
14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th Feb., has been
brought by the mail steamer Africa, which
arrived at Queenstown this morning at 2.30.
She brought 68 passengers and £7981 in
specie. She had been detained one day off
Halifax by a fog.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sherman has crossed the Whippy Swamp,
towards the South Carolina railroad, and,
after a successful engagement, seized Mc
bride’s Bridge, and crossed the north fork
of the Saltkehatchie, the cavalry at the same
time occupying Blackville and the stations
between Branchville and Augusta. A move-
ment beyond Branchville was repulsed
by Slocum, who was within four miles of
miles of Branchville, which was invested on
[tril] west and north. Sherman is subsequent-
ly slated to have flanked Branchville, and
cut off all railroad communication. He had
also landed in part of his force on James'
River, two miles south-west of Charleston,
The Confederals General Hardee reports on
the 13th February that the Federals had
driven in his pickets on James' Island, but
that he had afterwards re-established his
position. It appears, however, by subse-
quent advices, that the Confederates had
retreated, and it was reported that Branch-
ville had been evacuated.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are rather contradicting accounts re-
specting Charleston; but it appears proba-
ble that the Federals had completely isolat-
ed that city, and severed the last line of
communication between Virginia and the
South.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Grant still holds his position, and has ad-
ded three miles in his line of works. In
the late engagement the Confederates lost
500, and the Federals from 1500. Grant
has visited Washington and held conferen-
ces with the President and Secretary of
War, in reference, it is believed, to import-
ant military movements.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lee was removing his artillery to the
north side of the James' in front of the
Federal works. The 'Herald' concludes
therefrom that Lee is preparing to evacuate
Richmond.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The reported evacuation of Mobile is
confirmed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A movement has been made on Wilming-
ton. The Confederates were driven into
the main works, and the Federals, pressing
forward, captured the rifle pits. The Fed-
erals lost 70 men and captured 100 prison-
ers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Peace resolutions had been introduced
into the Federal House of Representatives,
but were defeated by a majority of 73 a-
gainst 43. Mr. Fessenden has proposed a
loan of 600,000,000 of dollars. On the 1st
of February the public debt was 2,153,000,-
000 dollars, and the interest 93,130,000.
The question of a general export duty is
being agitated in Congress.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The 'Herald' asserts that the Confed-
erate Commissioners proposed to Mr. Lin-
coln at the late conference the union of the
Northern and Southern armies for the en-
forcement of the Monroe doctrine.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A resolution has been introduced in the
Confederate House of Representatives di-
recting the President to accept from slave-
owners the services of negroes during the
war to perform military service. Nothing
in this act shall authorise any change in
the relation of slaves to their owners as
property, except by the consent of the
States where they reside, or by the laws
of those States. The House refused to
reject or postpone the consideration of the
bill and indefinitely reffered it to a select
committee of one member from each State.{{< /news/text >}}

MEXICO.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Havana correspondent of the New
York Associated Press denies the statement
that Mexico had ceded any territory to
France, and that Senator Gwinn had been
appointed Viceroy. Gwinn had been
unsuccessful in pressing his claims in Mex-
ico, and was en route for Europe, in order
to urge them there.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The New York journals publish advices
from Mexico to January 20, according to
which the French were concentrating upon
Oajaca.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Many towns were said to be throwing off
the imperial yoke.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Further advices from Mexico explain the
stout stand made at Oajaca by the native
troops from the fact that this natural fort-
ress is the birthplace of Juarez, and the
stronghold of his personal partisans. It
will tax all the agility of the Zouaves, it is
said, to scale the crags and ford the ravines
that fence it on every side. Military re-
ports represent the new Austrian and even
Belgian contingents as utterly unfit for the
sort of warfare that awaits them in this
wilderness. The troops are stately, solid
in their ranks, and tolerably serviceable on
level ground, but worthless for the work
of voltigeurs and smart skirmishers. They
have neither the endurance nor the activity
of the wiry, swift-footed French.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Advices from Mexico to the 29th of
January report that General Bazaine had
been defeated several times in the province
of Oaxier.—Juarez was said to be in So-
nora. The New York Tribune says,
private letters from Mexico state that the
Liberals are rising in the parts from which
the French had withdrawn. Diaz is as-
serted to have 12,000 men, and the entire
Liberal party numbered 60,000 men.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Semi-official advices from Sonora an-
nounce that a large force of Imperialist's
under Vega had invaded that province.
The Mexican General Patori started, at-
tacked, and defeated Vega at Elfurts, cap
turing his artillery and many prisoners,
including Vega himself, who was shot as
a traitor.{{< /news/text >}}

ITEMS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some six weeks since, we expressed the
hope, excited by a pretty well grounded
rumour, that the late visit of His Majesty,
the Supreme king of Siam to the Province
of Nak'awn-chei-see would result in the
construction of a large canal and carriage
road from this city to Ta-cheen river. We
are now happy to inform our readers that
that great internal Improvement has certain
ly been determined upon by His Majesty's
government, and will, it is believed, be ex-
pected with creditable despatch.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The most western terminus of the canal,
we are informed, is to be in the immediate
vicinity of the Steam Sugar Mill of Poh-
Yim & Co now occupied by "The Borneo
Company Limited" on Ta-ch'een river.
The situation of this mill is said to be a-
bout twenty miles from the mouth of the
river and very nearly west of Bangkok.
Starting from that point, it is to take a bee-
line towards the tall spires of Temple
Aroon-rot or Wat Chaang, which joins the
palace of H. R. H. Krom Hluang Wongsa
on the north. The canal will not come to
the Temple, but meeting the old channel of
Menam Chow-Phya at Bang-Chak it will
there stop and deliver all its charge to the
Creek Bangkok-Yai, which empties into
the Menam at the upper Fort. The carri-
age road is to be made on one of the banks
of the canal; and from Bang-Chak where
the new canal is to stop, it is to continue
its straight forward course toward the spires
above mentioned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Messrs S. Bateman and Captain C.
Achune together with an officer from the
Lord Mayor of the city, have been duly
appointed to survey the route of the canal.
They made their first essay about a month
since; but finding the air too smoky to see
the goal to which they are to steer from
Ta-cheen river, they postponed the survey
until a fall of rain shall dispel the haziness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The distance from the Steam Sugar Mill
to Bang-Chak is said to be only 516 sens—-
to 12¾ miles, and from Bang-Chak to Tem-
ple Aroon-rat only 160 sens—4 miles.
    This Canal and road when completed will
indeed be a great improvement. It will
shorten the distance from that great Sugar
District to Bangkok more than 30 miles.
It will open a large tract of the richest
prairie land to easy access and lucrative
culture, in the growth of rice and sugar
cane, which tract has hitherto been almost
an entire waste from the want of water
privileges. It will create very many of the
most eligible agricultural and horticultural
estates. It will insure all the cane and
paddy fields, on its right and left, against
serious damages in times of drought by
bringing water always at hand from which
they can be irrigated. The road on the
bank of the Canal will make a charming
way for pony rides and drives, of which the
citizens of Bangkok living on the western
side of the river, are entirely deprived, and
find it hard to bear patiently when they see
their fellow citizens on the Eastern side
enjoying daily their galloping steeds.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not only for the pleasure of the comparatively
few, who could afford to ride and
drive on this new Road, but much more for
the general welfare of all classes, is it to be
fervently hoped, that the Siamese Government
will make a short work of completing
this great public good.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Being the only "Bangkok Recorder" we
have to inform our readers that the Siamese
government have again been sadly disap-
pointed in regard to fond hopes placed up-
on White Elephants. The new Creature of
just the right complexion, which was supposed
to have been effectually surrounded
in the forests of Panat'aneek has prov-
en to be an apparition or an hoax, and it
is quite possible a combination of both.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}At about 10 P. M. of the 25th inst
the house of Capt. Roberts was burglar-
iously entered by a Chinaman, who on be-
ing discovered by the inmates, attempted
to kill both Capt. Roberts and a China wo-
man living in the house. Both received
very severe and dangerous wounds, and
are now in a precarious state. Through
the kindness of Mr. Blake, Dr. Campbell
was promptly sent for, who most probably
saved the lives of both. The villian
must have received at least one wound from
Capt. Robert's sword-stick, for next morning
fresh blood was traced by the police
for several hundred yards. We sincerely
hope the mark he carries with him may
lead to his discovery, he deserves to be
made a public example.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}On Monday night a thief got on board
the Siamese barque "Fortune," and stole
a Chronometer (No. 2275 made by Frods-
am, ) valued at one hundred and twenty
ticals, a spy-glass and several yards of new
cloth from the cabin. The Capt, on being
awoke by the barking of his dog, saw a
Chinaman throw something over the ship's
tafrail and then jump after it. The thief
must have wrapped the Chronometer in
the cloth, and then made a small line
(which is missing also) fast to it, the
other end might be fastened to his waist
thus leaving both hands clear for swimming.
He swam so fast that before Capt. Luis
could man a boat he was lost sight of.{{< /news/text >}}

FRANCE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is stated that extensive reductions are
to be made in what may be called the ef-
fective strength of the army. This is to be
accomplished by increasing the reserve to
400,000 in the course of the present year,
which will reduce the number of men act-
ually under arms to about 340,000. A
great saving will thus be effected, as the
reserve receive pay only for the two months
during which they are out for training. It
is further said that the reason why this ar-
rangement was not stated in the imperial
speech was, that it was understood that it
would produce more effect if announced in
the Chamber of Deputies in the course of
the debate on the budget, and might prove
serviceable in shutting the mouths of the
Opposition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A despatch from Cardinal Antonelli re-
lative to the letters of Mgr. Chigi had ar-
rived at the Foreign-office, and its contents
have given every satisfaction that the gov-
ernment had a right to expect. The For-
eign Minister is said to have informed the
Italian government that the period of two
years preceding the evacuation of Rome
by the French troops will be calculated
from the 6th of February last, that being
the day on which King Victor Emmanuel
left Turin for Florence.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The committees who are to be entrusted
with the drawing up of the address in re-
ply to the emperor's speech have been elect-
ed by the Senate and the Corps Legis-
latif. It is observed that in the former
body the anti-clerical element greatly pre-
dominates.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The leading members of the legislative
Opposition continue to hold meetings. M
M. Murie, Berryer, Thiers, Jules Simon,
Favre, Pelletan, Picard, Garnier Pages,
and others are to draw up the amendments
to the address. It appears to be the gen-
eral resolution not to make foreign affairs
so prominent a theme of discussion this
year as in former sessions Something will
no doubt be said about Italy and about
Mexico, but it does not seem probable
that there will be any organised opposition,
founded on France's relations with either
country. Home affairs will principally oc-
cupy attention. The state of education a-
mong the poor, and the laws which restrict
public meetings and the free expression of
opinion, will form subjects for animated
discussion. There is said to be a split a-
mongst the Opposition party, owing to M.
Ollivier having presumed to take an in-
dependent view and form a party for him-
self. The debate on the address is to come
on on March 13.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Several of the Paris journals notice the
incompleteness of the intelligence contain-
ed in the livre jaune. Instead of contain-
ing a fair selection of the various despat-
ches on the important foreign questions
of the last year, the volume is confined ex-
clusively to the despatches of M. Drouyn
de Lhuys, ignoring entirely the despat-
ches received from the French ambas-
sadors at foreign courts. All that can be
learned from the book, it is said, is that
France is on bad terms with the Pope and
is casting a wistful eye on Tunis.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Archbishop of Paris, one of the two
thorough-paced Bonapartists having a seat
on the episcopal bench, has issued a pas-
toral on the subject of the Encyclical let-
ter, which has been read from the pulpit
of every church in Paris It is extremely
long The archbishop endeavours to make
out that the Encyclical means nothing at
all, and praises the Pope as the friend of
progress, civilization, and so forth. He al-
so undertakes the defence of the concordat,
so violently attacked by some of his right
reverend brethren. The whole gist of the
document is decidedly anti-Papal. A
triumphal reception to the Bishop of Nis-
mes, on his return from Rome to his
diocese, had been prepared, but was pro-
hibited by the government, who invited
the bishop to keep quiet—an invitation
which the bishop meekly accepted.{{< /news/text >}}

THE DUCHIES.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prussian Government has informed
the Austrian cabinet of the nature of its
claims to the Duchies, but they have
not yet been published. It is understood
that in the discussions which have recently
taken place on this question two opposite
views were expressed in the Prussian cab-
inet. To day, February 27, an assembly
of delegates from the political associations
of Schleswig and Holstein will take place at
Rendsburg to express their wishes in
reference to the future relations between
the Duchies and Prussia. The Prussian
party is said to be making great efforts to
procure the passing of resolutions in favour of
annexation to Prussia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Two of the Prussian officers of the
Crown have gone to Copenhagen, to in-
stitute researches in the Danish archives in
reference to the right of succession to the
Duchies. The royal commission have
already informed M. von Bismarck that
they will not grant the whole of the rights
to one pretender only, and that they will
be compelled to admit that the claims of
the Duke of Augustenburg entitle him to
one-third part of the succession. A com-
promise between Prussia and the duke will
therefore become unavoidable. Should
Prussia decide upon the complete annex-
ation of both Duchies, a fair indemnity
should be allowed to the Duke of Augsten-
burg. If, on the other hand, Prussia should
determine upon to relinquishing the sovereign-
ity of the Duchies to the duke, it is understood
that she will not do so without retaining
the sovereignty over certain territorial
points.{{< /news/text >}}

ITALY.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}King Victor Emmanuel left Florence for
Bologna on Feb 22. The National Guard
lined the streets through which his majesty
passed. The king proceeded on the follow-
ing day to Turin, where he was received
by the municipal junta and deputations
from working men’s societies. Great en-
thusiasm was manifested. His majesty
subsequently passed in review the National
Guard, by whom he was loudly cheered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A petition has been presented to the
Senate, signed by 11,000 inhabitants of
Turin, relative to the events of September
last. The consideration of this petition
was declared urgent by the Senate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Turin papers deny that the two
years preceding the evacuation of Rome
by the French troops are to be calculated
from the day of the king’s departure for
Florence. The ‘Opinione’ refers to the
agreement dated the 3rd of October last,
according to which the period is to be
reckoned from the date of the decree for
the transfer of the capital. The decree
was sanctioned by the king on the 11th of
December.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another notorious brigand has been
captured in Italy. General Pallavicini has
approached the celebrated Totaro, to-
gether with ten men of his band. He is
described as a tall man, stern and gloomy-
looking, rather than of ferocious aspect, 37
years old, and of great cunning and
resource.{{< /news/text >}}
