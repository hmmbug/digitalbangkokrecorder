On the Ferry.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
BY MRS. MARY CLEMMER AMES.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}On the ferry, sailing over

{{< news/indent2 >}}To the city, lying dim

{{< news/indent1 >}}In the mellow mist of evening

{{< news/indent2 >}}By the river's further rim:

{{< news/indent1 >}}On the ferry, gazing outward

{{< news/indent2 >}}To the ocean calm and cold;

{{< news/indent1 >}}While the blue bay dips its waters

{{< news/indent2 >}}In the sunset's fleeting gold.

{{< news/indent1 >}}On the ferry, gazing outward,

{{< news/indent2 >}}O thou ocean deep and wide,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Every pulse is beating measure

{{< news/indent2 >}}With the rhythm of thy tide!

{{< news/indent1 >}}Loving waves kiss warm and eager;

{{< news/indent2 >}}Motionless the great ships stand,

{{< news/indent1 >}}While above each pendulous pennon,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Lures me with a beckoning hand.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Calm on the uneasy waters

{{< news/indent2 >}}Leans the sunset-bars of flame,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Like the legendary ladder

{{< news/indent2 >}}On which angels went and came.

{{< news/indent1 >}}In another summer evening,

{{< news/indent2 >}}On a little way before,

{{< news/indent1 >}}I shall reach another ferry,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Seeking swift a dimmer shore.

{{< news/indent1 >}}I shall cross a wider ferry,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Crossing to return no more,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Sailing for a fairer city,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Waiting on a lovelier shore.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Will God's sunshine beam around me,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Fusing every wave in gold?

{{< news/indent1 >}}Gently will you row me over

{{< news/indent2 >}}Charon, boatman, calm and old!

{{< news/indent1 >}}When these life-airs cease to chill me,

{{< news/indent2 >}}When my meager day is done,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Boatman, bear me through the splendor,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Falling from the setting sun!

{{< news/indent1 >}}Bear me outward to the mystery

{{< news/indent2 >}}The Eternal will unfold,

{{< news/indent1 >}}To the unrevealed glory

{{< news/indent2 >}}Shut within yon gates of gold.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Life may touch the soul so gently

{{< news/indent2 >}}We can hardly call it rough;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Yet we'll all say in its closing

{{< news/indent2 >}}Our brief day's been long enough.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Thus I stand with gathered garments,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Ere the deeper shadows fall;

{{< news/indent2 >}}O, my heart! drop thy last idol,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Listening for the boatman's call.

{{< news/indent2 >}}Come! and by my spirit's sinking,

{{< news/indent1 >}}By my shrinking fears untold,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Bear me gently o'er those waters,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Charon, boatman, calm and cold.

The Accusation Against Mr.
Gladstone.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}My last letter was about Gladstone;
and, as at the end of it I was very far
from the woe which Voltaire pronounced
upon "the man who says all he has to
say upon any subject," this letter shall be
about Mr. Gladstone also. A very serious
accusation is being pressed against him.
All the Tory papers and all the Toryized
Whig ones are ringing the changes upon
Mr. Gladstone's "haughty bearing" in
the House, upon his "imperious spirit,"
and especially upon the alleged "irrasci-
bility of his temper;" and they constan-
tly affirm that the catastrophe to his Re-
form Bill and to his administration was
largely owing to his display of these
qualities.{{< news/indent2 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to his having been lacking in com-
mand of his temper, and in proper de-
ference to the House, since he became its
leader, I believe that a statement more
baseless it would be impossible to manu-
facture. The question becomes a very
simple one of testimony. I will not in-
vite myself into the witness-box; al-
though I could testify that, whenever I
have enjoyed the privilege of being in
the House of Commons, I have been
struck with admiration at the dignified
and graceful courtesy of Mr. Gladstone;
at the charm and fascination of his bear-
ing; at the total absence of any tinge of
arrogance in his treatment of other mem-
bers; at his unflagging attention to every
reasonable appeal, from whatever quarter
of the room; at his forbearance toward
foes who were raging for his destruction;
at his marvelous patience under insults
the most annoying and unseemly. I will
summon to the stand two witnesses of
the highest eminence and of the most
unquestionable reliability.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a speech at Lambeth, on the 22d of
June, the celebrated Thomas Hughes,
author of "Tom Brown's School Days,"
made these remarks:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Then it is said that the Liberal ma-
jority has been lost through Mr. Glad-
stone's imperiousness. I ask you to look
this matter fairly in the face. Is it a
proof of imperiousness that Mr. Glad-
stone has given up to the Opposition
every point except those which he deem-
ed absolutely material? Is that the con-
duct of a haughty and intolerant man,
who tries to put down honest opposition?
Never was there a baser calumny uttered
against a great man. [Cheers.] My ad-
miration for that noble man has been
growing all through the session, when I
saw how earnestly he battled to keep the
promises he had made. Give me the
leader who acts as if he had a work to
accomplish, as if a woe was on him if he
did not accomplish it. [Cheers.] It is a
disgrace to the House of Commons that
they don't know a great man when they
see him. [Continued cheering.] All this
session they have been like a pack of
hounds let loose on the leader of the
House of Commons."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The highly respected member for the
city of Cork, Mr. J. F. Maguire, who
must be known in America by his ad-
mirable "Biography of Father Matthew,"
has just made public a letter, from which
I take the following sentences:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"And how did the people's champion
bear himself in this protracted struggle?
I watched him with singular interest in
all the varying fortunes of the campaign
—for that it was; and I must conscien-
tiously admit that I do not believe that
any statesman, having a due regard to
his own honor, could have borne himself
with more loyalty to his cause, or with a
juster deference to the legitimate wishes
of the House. From his very organiza-
tion he must be specially susceptible to
taunt, sneer, insinuation, however deli-
cate or covert it may be; and Heaven
knows these were rained on his head for
four long months; yet I do not remem-
ber a single instance in which he lost his
temper, compromised his dignity, or
transgressed the limits of that decorum
which is looked for in a minister of the
crown, human as he must be. He was
necessarily compelled at times to employ
the same weapons that were directed
against him; but he has on many occa-
sions held back his hand rather than
strike, though the enemy's armor was all
agape with rents and crevices, or though
his opponent was naked to his thrust. I
shall say nothing of his marvelous en-
durance, as night after night he was
faithfully at his post, ever on the alert,
ready at any moment to meet his op-
ponents, whatever their mode or manner
of attack; or how, when the emergency
called for a fuller display of his powers
and a bolder enunciation of the living
and essential principles of his measures,
his oratory borrowed majesty from the
immineuce of the perils, and his words
swelled like the deep notes of an organ,
or startled like the blast of a trumpet.
Let me only say that he fell with honor
—-fell, but to rise stronger than ever in
the public conviction of his honesty [and
truth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Will the London correspondent of the
New York Times accept these two little
bones, and oblige the world by picking
them?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Socrates, on one occasion, being com-
plimented for having the best possible
temper in the world, replied that he
“had the worst possible temper, with the
best possible control of it.” I do not say
that the former part of this Socratic con-
fession would exactly apply to Mr.
Gladstone, but he has shown that the
later part would. A finely strung, ex-
citable, sensitive man, in several emergen-
cies, while still in a subordinate position,
he has grown extremely angry in the
House of Commons; he has got into a
passion; and, giving the rein to his
boundless powers of sarcasm and invec-
tive, he has scourged his antagonists to
his own and their content. Upon the
death of Lord Palmerston, almost the
only doubt in the minds of Mr. Glad-
stone’s admirers was whether he could
always and infallibly command that high
and stormy spirit of his; for it would be
fatal to a leader of the House if his op-
ponents knew that, by a series of judici-
ously-contrived insults, they could throw
him off his guard. The Tories of all
shapes and grades raised the cry that he
would certainly lose his temper; and
they evidently resolved that he should.
They worried, tormented, insidiously at-
tacked him; and they have been exceed-
ingly angry because they could not make
him so. When one of their champion
brow-beaters, like Mr. Lowe, of rare
vituperative genius, has risen to conduct
an attack, a scene like this has been
usually presented: Mr. Gladstone would
quietly settle far down on the Treasury
Bench, stretch out his legs in front of
him, and there, with his feet against the
base of the table, his hands folded over
his breast, the back of his head against
the back of the bench, his pale, sad, but
resolute face upturned, his eyes closed
or gazing calmly at the lighted roof of
the chamber, he would receive the pel-
tings of the storm; and hour after hour,
as the assaults raved on, he would make
no sign of passion or resentment, nor any
movement, save occasionally when some
taunt of peculiar malignity would seem
to send a pang to his heart and a nervous
twitching for an instant across his face.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Wise, affluent, and magnanimous
statesman! Hitherto renowned for
strength to do, and henceforth worthy
of the grander renown of strength to
suffer! Higher from defeat than your
enemies are from victory, advancing in
the impenetrable armor of integrity, sus-
tained by the benedictions of Heaven,
and cheered by the homage and love of
the millions who in all quarters of the
globe speak the mother-speech of Eng-
land, may your power be as great as your
beneficent purpose, and may your stately
career long continue to shed gladness on
palace and on cottage, to lighten the bur-
dens of the weary, to uplift those whom
cruel circumstance has depressed, and to
leave to the generations of mankind a
model of the highest Christian statesman-

Southern Feeling.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As one page, or feature, of the present
historic times, it may not be altogether
uninstructive to place on record some of
the utterances, that now and then appear
in the Southern Press, concerning the
ladies who go to teach the Freedmen.
Not content with the damning crime of
keeping the negro in ignorance, making it
by statute, a penal offense, to be punished
with heavy fines and long imprisonment–-
or oftener capital, by the code and court of
Judge Lynch–-to teach a slave to read
even a single page of the Bible, when, with
some show of dreadful reason, they could
plead the necessities of their fearful system,
they now show how deeply “the iron of
Slavery has entered their own soul,” by
their fiendish malice towards those who,
at great personal sacrifice, are trying to
supply their lack of service–-to undo the
terrible mischiefs of their former wicked-
ness. With rare exceptions, our teachers
are treated by the Southern whites with
complete social ostracism. Instead of the
friendly call at their homes or recognition
in the streets, they encounter at best the
averted eye and silent contempt, if they are
spared the words of blackguardism, or that
feminine accomplishment, peculiar to
Southern gentility, of “gathering up their
skirts,” that, in passing, their dresses shall
escape the hated contact.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In rare instances have our teachers
been able to find board in white families,
for the reason, that public sentiment sets
so strongly against them, that even those,
who may be comparatively friendly them-
selves, or who would be glad to do it for
the money, are afraid. One of our mission
families in Virginia, was compelled to
forego the use of meat for weeks, because
the Freedmen was not able to furnish it,
and the whites had no meat for “nigger
teachers.”{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}We have intimated that there are excep-
tions. There are. We trust they will in-
crease. Down in Norfolk, two of the
leading clergymen welcome those very
"school marms," the Editor so berates in
the extract below, as they do also that
Northern aid we are rendering, (thus do-
ing what they cannot do) and bestow on
one of our schools the, no doubt, merited
compliment of being the best school, white
or black, they had ever visited.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the general ANIMUS of the South is
well expressed in the following extracts,
we clip from Southern papers. And it
seems to us, they clearly indicate,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}1. That the Freedmen's Bureau is still a
necessity;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}2. That, if as one of the Editors phrases
it, their "former masters" are the Freed-
men's ONLY "natural protectors," their
case is a bad one; and{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}3. That the North has here a work on its
hands of no mean dimensions and prob-
ably of no brief continuance.{{< /news/text >}}

ial in the Norfolk VIRGINIAN of July

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
They are Gone or Going.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our grief knows no bounds—-our eyes
are two fountains from which rivers of
tears flow continually and refuse to "dry
up," but roll down our innocent nose with
increasing volume. We are, like Calypso,
inconsolable—-and we mourn in a spirit of
abject despair, that refuses all comfort; for
hope has died within us. The only joy of
our existence in Norfolk has deserted us.
The negro "schoolmarms" are either gone,
going, or to go, and we don't much care
which, where to, or how-—whether it be to
the more frigid regions of the northern
zone, or to a still more torrid climate; in-
deed, we may say that we care very little
what land they are borne to, so not again
to "our'n" even though it be that bourne
whence no traveler returns. Our grief at
their departure is, however, lightened
somewhat by the recollection of the fact
that we will get rid of a most abominable
nuisance; and here the theory of compensa-
tion comes in to compensate and console
us, and dry up the fountains of our tears.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our only fear is that their departure
will not be eternal, and like other birds of
prey they may return to us in season, and
again take shelter with their brood of
black-birds, under the protecting wings of
that all-gobbling, and foulest old fowls,
the well-known buzzard yclept Freedmen's
Bureau.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In all seriousness, however, we congratu-
late our citizens upon a "good rid[?]ance of
bad baggage" in the reported departure of
these impudent missionaries. Of all the
insults to which the Southern people have
been subjected, this was the heaviest to
bear. It was the refinement of torture.
It did not draw our flesh off the bones as
with hot pincers; nor did it stretch our
muscles on the rack, and fill our whole
physical system with aches and pinches;
but it was the more refined torture of an
insult to our pride of manhood and our
feelings; it was heaping coals upon our
mental anguish-—to have sent among us a
lot of ignorant, narrow-minded, bigoted
fanatics, ostensibly for the purpose of pro-
pagating the gospel among the heathen,
and teaching our little negroes and big ne-
groes, and all kinds of negroes, to read the
Bible and show them the road to salvation,
just, as if we were Feejee Islanders and
worshippers of the African Fetish gods,
snakes, toads and terrapins; but whose real
object was to disorganize and demoralize
still more our peasantry and laboring
population. In this way they have done
incalculable mischief. Had they confined
themselves merely to teaching the objects
of their idolatry the rudiments of our
English education—to read, to write, and
to cypher, (which is more trouble than
they take with the children of their poor
white neighbors at home,) we might have
let their impudent assumptions pass with
the contempt of silence; but they failed to
confine themselves to these harmless ob-
jects, and at once set to work assiduously to
array the colored race against their former
masters and present natural protectors.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And the people of Norfolk have submit-
ted to all of this—-to this terrible indignity,
without even a murmur. Was ever such
respect shown for women, for order for
peace, for obligations imposed by the ad-
verse fortunes of war? Would any other
people—-would the citizens of any of the
Northern States—have allowed themselves
to be so foully insulted? Had the South
dared to send missionaries among them to
teach their ignorant masses to read and to
write, and instruct them in the duties of
Christianity, their indignation, we opine,
would have been manifested in some more
striking manner than by a formal protest
in words. We care nothing for these school-
marms, nor how much knowledge may be
crammed into a little negro's head; but it
is the iron of the insult which enters grat-
ingly into our souls, and like the clanking
of Mr. Davis's chains, forces us to cry out
"Oh! the shame; oh! the shame."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We trust, now that the negro schools
have had their annual examination-—which
came off with all the adjuncts of music
and declamation, and Bureaucratic gran-
deur—-and that they are to have a summer
vacation, that we have seen, or soon shall
see the last of these impudent women, who
have done us so much harm, and that
their return to these latitudes may be post-
poned indefinitely. We have plenty of
the South and to the manor born, to make
teachers for these colored schools, and
who can instruct them aright, too, in the
duties of their station as well as in the less
important rules of English syntax and
natural philosophy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hail with satisfaction the departure
of these female disorganizers, and trust n
favoring gale will ever return them to ou
shores, and that their bureau and oth e
furniture may soon follow in their wake.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The thrill of horror at the Memphis
massacre still lingers, and we can better
appreciate what the Memphis AVALNCHB
ssys in connection therewith in the follow-
ing extract:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Another lesson has been taught the
white fanatics. It is that we want none
of their 'school-marmus' among any of our
population, white or black. It is said they
have all left in a great fright. A happy
riddance we have. They were nuisances.
Women, who could come down South to
teach negroes, are unfit for any but negro
society. The South never learnt anything
from New England. The Pharisaical reli-
gion, the morals, the 'isms' of that land of
hickory hams and wooden nutmegs have
never obtained foothold among us, never
will. These 'isms' are sprouts to be plan-
ted among us by these 'school-marms, and
the South will rejoice when they have left
us."{{< /news/text >}}

Per Contra.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the above we have the dark and re-
pulsive side of the picture, that, which
now "unfortunately" constitutes the too
general aspects of Southern thought and
feeling. There are however, as intimated,
other and more encouraging demonstra-
tions of returning sanity and juster views
of the situation, and what the exigencies
of the times require. The number is in-
creasing, who see the wisdom, if not the
justice, of giving their late slaves, now
that they are free, that education which
their own interests and safety require.{{< /news/text >}}

Colored Schools.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We take great pleasure in recording the
interest everywhere manifested in behalf
of the education of the colored people.
No small credit is due for all this to the
much abused school-marmas, for the self-
denial and philanthropy which induced
them to leave their much vaunted and be-
loved New England, and visit this benight-
ed Southern land, illuminating the night
of our barbarism by the light of their con-
tinuance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It should be remembered, moreover, that
this serious step is not usually the result of
the evanescent dream of young romance.
By no means. Those who engage in this
important and laudable missionary work
generally are ladies of riper years, who
may be supposed to have well counted the
cost of the venture.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Preaching to the heathen, instructing
and civilizing them, appears an innate
passion with the pious descendants of the
Pilgrims. Fortunate they to find the
PARTHEN INFIDELES brought almost to their
very doors. Here they can gratify their
holy zeal without incurring the danger of
a long sea voyage, or the disagreeable pre-
dicament of being incorporated with a
sandwich. What a pity our tropical
climate and its concomitant epidemics
make such sad inroads upon their health
and spirits; and we do not think that, in
our selfishness, we ought to insist on their
remaining here any longer than the present
month. All the meteorological signs con-
cur in predicting a sickly season.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We regret the necessity of this Hegira;
for we can ill spare these Plymouth pil-
grims of progress. There are some among
us it is true, who are either so ignorant or
prejudiced, as to suppose that Southern
ladies are the equals of these accomplish-
ed Northerners. Such is not our opinion.
No Southern lady can impart that assurance
and self-confidence, which we saw crop-
ping out on all occasions among the per-
formers at the late exhibitions. We might
enumerate other differences, but want of
space compels us to bring our long school
account to an abrupt close.—AMERICAN

The Presbytery of Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The regular meeting of the Pres-
bytery of Siam took place, according
to the notice given in our last issue,
at the Chapel of the Presbyterian
Mission to day at 10 o'clock A. M.
There were present Rev. Messrs. Wil-
son, McGilvary, McDonald, McFar-
land, and George—-together with Rev.
Mr. Carden of the Presbyterian Mis-
sion, and Rev. W. Dean D. D. of the
Am. Baptist Mission, and Rev. D. B.
Bradley of the Amer. Miss. Association,
who were invited to sit as correspon-
ding members, and participate in all
the deliberations of the body, but were
not allowed a vote. The Rev. Dr.
House was absent on a visit to the
U. S.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}According to a custom in the Pres-
byterian church, the Presbytery was
opened with a sermon by the last Mod-
erator or presiding officer-—Rev. D.
McGilvary from John XIV: 30—31.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After the sermon the Presbytery
was constituted by prayer, when Rev.
Mr. Wilson was chosen moderator for
the present session, and Mr. McDon-
ald temporary clerk.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among the items of business of a
general interest we might specify an
interesting report read by Mr. McDon-
ald, chairman of a committee appoint-
ed at a previous meeting, on a ques-
tion that had been referred to the Pres-
bytery for its advice. It is one of
general interest in this and all coun-
tries where the system of slavery exists,
viz, what is a church session to do
in case of an application for church
membership by a slave, who is com-
pelled by his master to work, on the
Sabbath, or subject himself to punish-
ment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The report took the open ground
that there is but one course open in
such cases, that the Bible recognizes
no lowering of its claims in regard to
the 4th commandment more than the
2nd, and that in all cases, where the
commands of God and those of man
conflict, we must resolutely obey God
rather than man, and that he who is
not willing to do so even in face of
persecution, creates a probability that he
is not prepared to seek communion with
the church. It called forth a pleasant
and rather animated discussion be-
tween some of the members and es-
pecially the corresponding members
as to the extent in which a slave is
exonerated from guilt in the violation
of God's commands by the constraint
of a master.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the one hand it was maintained
that in all such cases where a slave
really and sincerely endeavors to obey
the law of God, but is hindered by
his master, he becomes merely a
mechanical tool in the hand of that
master, and the guilt rests with the
master. On the other hand it was
maintained by the majority that no
such exoneration could be claimed.
That in the subject of religion, while
the Bible teaches and enforces sub-
mission “to the powers that be”—every
man must make his election and de-
cide whether he will take God as his
sovereign and law giver or man. The
vote was then taken, and the report
unanimously adopted.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Presbytery then took a recess
till 2 P. M.-—when an invitation was
given in behalf of the ladies of the
mission to all present, among whom
we were pleased to see our friend
J. M. Hood Esq. U. S. Consul, to par-
take of a hospitable tiffin at each of
the three families. We need not of
course remark that they, as ladies al-
ways do on such occasions, performed
their duty to the satisfaction of their
guests.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the afternoon, according to a
standing rule, half an hour was spent
in devotional exercises. The prin-
cipal item of business besides was a
free conversation among the members
and corresponding members on the
progress of the mission work during
the year. On the whole there seems
much ground of encouragement. Some
marked progress has been made
during the year though less than we
could desire to see. Besides the reg-
ular preaching of the gospel at the
different stations and missions repre-
sented, in most of which there have
been a few accessions, we might men-
tion as an encouraging feature a board-
ing school conducted at the mission
where the Presbytery met, in which
seniors as well as religion is taught,
and some smaller schools elsewhere,
while we have endeavored, and we
hope with some degree of success, to
make both of our papers, and especially
the Siamese edition, hand-maids of
religion, and aids of the mission cause.
The Presbytery adjourned to meet
next Monday morning, when a little
remaining business will be attended to.{{< /news/text >}}

Sandwich Island No. 5.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the beginning of the year 1823
the Missionaries had among their re-
gular pupils twenty-four princes and
princesses, there being about an equal
number of both sexes. Kapiolani and
her husband Naihe who were subse-
quently eminently efficient in planting
the gospel in southern Hawaii were
members of those classes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The mission was reinforced that
year from the U. S. by 3 ordained
missionaries, 2 licensed preachers, 1
physician and 1 superintendant of se-
cular affairs, and their wives. Their
names were William Richards, Charles
S. Stewart, Artemus Bishop, Joseph
Goodrich, James Ely, Abraham Bla-
tchley, and Levi Chamberlain. King
Liholiho, welcomed them in a letter
to the Captain of the vessel in which
they came, in the following laconic
words.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Captain Clasby:—-Love to you.
This is my communication to you.
You have done well in bringing hith-
er the now teachers. You shall pay
nothing on account of the harbor,—-
nothing at all. Grateful affection to
you. {{< news/indent2 >}} LIHOLIHO IOLANI.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Keopuolani, the king's mother, hav-
ing for months given good evidence of
being a converted woman, was receiv-
ed into the church in 1823, and was,
the first who received baptism on the
Islands. Being “a daughter of a race of
kings, wife of a king, and mother of two
kings,” she was consequently one of
the highest in honors on the islands,
and was, before her conversion, regard-
ed by the people with the greatest
veneration, so much so, that they dare
not look upon her person but from the
profoundest prostrations. But when
she became a christian, she had little
relish for such honors, and greatly dis-
tinguished herself by her amiableness
of temper, her gentleness and benevo-
lence. When in her last sickness, be-
lieving that she would not recover,
she gave a particular charge to her
friends and her people that the custom-
ary heathen superstitions should not
be practiced at her death. Her charge
was obeyed, and that was the begin-
ning of the great reform that soon
took place with regard to those abo-
minations. She died in the triumphs
of faith on the 16th of September 1823.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the autumn of this year king
Liholiho, having an ardent desire to
know more of the world, and being
exceedingly impulsive, determined that
he would embrace an opportunity
which then presented of visiting Eng-
land. He did so, and took with him
his Queen Kamamalu and two of his
chiefs. But, most unfortunately, soon
after his arrival he and all his retinue
were seized with the measles before
they had had an audience with king
George IV, and both he and his queen
died of that disease. But the two
chiefs recovered, and returned a few
months afterwards to the islands. One
of them was still alive when Dr. An-
derson visited the place in 1863, and
was then Governor of Hawaii. His
name is Kekuanaoa, and is the father
of Kamehameha IV. Princess Kaahu-
manu became regent on the death of
Liholiho, and gave her decided and
strong support to the gospel. Through
her influence, schools were established
for the people of all ages and ranks,
most of them being taught by persons
who had received their first lessons
from the missionaries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Kapiolani, whose name is above
mentioned, another distinguished prin-
cess, on becoming a christian, used
her great influence directly and pow-
erfully for the encouragement of the
missionary work. She made a jour-
ney on foot one hundred miles with a
numerous retinue to the volcanic cra-
ter Kilauea for the purpose of prov-
ing to the people, that the remaining
superstitions concerning the godless
Pele who was supposed to cause the
earth to quake and the crater to belch
forth red-hot lava, was all a mere hum-
bug. While near the place, she in va-
rious ways proved to her auditors that
none need dread any evil consequen-
ces from showing contempt of those
superstitions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The remains of the late king and
Queen who died in England were very
considerately sent back by the English
government to the Islands in charge of
Lord Byron in a British Frigate. A
council of the principle chiefs of the
island was held soon after the arrival
of the Frigate, which his lordship at-
tended in company with the mission-
aries. That council is said to have
taken a marked christian character,
and made a formal acknowledgement
of the authority of the christian reli-
gion. And hence that may be said to
be the first introduction of the Sand-
wich Islands into the family of Chris-
tian nations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Princess Regent, Kaahumann
was most active and thorough in a
great variety of reformatory measures
for rearing a christian government.
Kapiolani and her husband she com-
mended for their powerful aid in sup-
pressing "murder, infanticide, theft,
Sabbath deseecration, drunkenness and
licentiousness." Prince Kauikeaouli,
then aged nine years, the brother of the
deceased king, and heir apparent "was
placed under the regular instruction
of the missionaries that he might shun
the errors of his deceased brother."
In all these measures for the improve-
ment of government, as well as for
missionary instruction in general, the
Islanders were encouraged by the coun-
sils of Lord Byron.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Near the close of the year 1825,
Kaahumanu, and nine other principal
chiefs were admitted to church mem-
bership, having been propounded for it
nine months. These all ran well the
christian race, and finished their course
in the triumph of faith. Though the
Sandwich Island government was thus,
as we may say, christianized at the
beginning, and the church and state
in one sense united, yet they have ne-
ver to this day been united in the com-
mon acceptation of the term. While
the people have become a church go-
ing people, and the state a Christian
government, the two have been kept
distinct in their organizations and
duties.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As early as 1826 the Islanders had
been accustomed to assemble in great
multitudes, generally in the vicinity
of some chief to hear the gospel. This
made it necessary to build large meet-
ing houses. At Kawaihae, on Hawaii
there assembled that year not less than
10,000 persons at once, to listen to
the preaching of the gospel. A meet-
ing house was built by the nation the
same year at Kailua, 180 feet long by
78 feet broad, that would seat 5000
persons. The chief rulers of the na-
tion attended its consecration, and
made addresses to the multitudes, de-
claring the purposes of the govern-
ment to follow the principles of chris-
tianity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There were then schools establish-
ed in every district of the Islands,
comprising 400 teachers, and 25,000
pupils, nearly all of whom were adults.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Strange to say, there were not wan-
ting in that place and time of wonder-
ful awakening and reformation, per-
sons, among whom were Europeans,
who had the hardihood to stigmatize
the efforts of the missionaries as being
a curse to the nation. Mr. John Young
whose name was mentioned in our
first article, had then been a resident
on the islands forty years, and had
been "the confidential adviser of the
first Kamehameha, and grand father
to the queen of Kamehameha IV,"
gives the following very interesting and
credible testimony concerning the re-
formation that had been wrought. It
was written at Kawaihae the 27th of
November 1826.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Whereas it has been represented
by many persons, that the labors of
missionaries in these Islands are at-
tended with evil and disadvantage to
the people, I hereby most cheerfully
give my testimony to the contrary. I
am fully convinced that the good
which is accomplishing and already
effected is not little. The great and
radical change already made for the
better, in the manners and customs of
this people, has far surpassed my most
sanguine expectations. During the
forty years that I have resided here, I
have known thousands of defenceless
human beings cruelly massacred in
their exterminating wars. I have seen
multitudes of my fellow beings offered
in sacrifice to their idol gods. I have
seen this large island (Hawaii) once
filled with inhabitants dwindle down
to its present numbers through wars
and disease, and I am persuaded that
nothing but christianity can preserve
their total extinction. I rejoice that
true religion is taking the place of
superstition and idolatry, that good
morals are superseding the reign of
crime, and that a code of christian
laws is about to take the place of ty-
ranny and oppression. These things
are what I have longed wished for,
but have never seen till now. I thank
God that in my old age I see them,
and humbly trust I feel them too."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would appear that one of the
false witnesses against the Protestant
Mission on the Islands was a French-
man by the name of Rives. He had
been living sometime among the peo-
ple, and at length, secreting himself in
the ship which bore king Liholiho to
England, he secured a passage. And
having arrived, he proceeded to France
and falsely represented himself as being
the owner of large plantations on the
Islands, as having great influence with
the king of Hawaii, and as having a
great desire for the conversion of that
people to the Roman Catholic faith.
He succeeded in persuading three
French Roman Catholic priests to go
as missionaries to Hawaii, and several
laymen of the same faith to accom-
pany them as agriculturists on his pre-
tended plantations. They reached the
Island July 7th 1827.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Such was the origin of the Roman
Catholic mission to the Sandwich Is-
lands. Their arrival was annoying to
the native rulers, who regarded their
worship as a return towards their for-
mer idolatrous system, and as so far
contrary to their laws."{{< /news/text >}}

The present king of Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
PHA CHAUM KLAE.
CHAPTER XI
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Though a good ruler is supposed to
encourage enterprise and patronise
learning and religion, that is accom-
plished in a good government more
by protection than patronage. In pre-
senting the reign of any king there-
fore, we should look at the laws and
usages of the country to determine
the rank of the nation, the power of
its ruler, and the hopes of the country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the present king ascended
the throne he found usages establish-
ed, and a system of jurisprudence in
practice, which he must have perceiv-
ed exceedingly defective. But one
man, though a king, cannot upturn
long standing customs, without great
disturbance. So that often it is better
to endure the defects of a custom al-
ready in force, rather than immedi-
ately institute an entirely new usage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are free to pronounce, the old
system of punishing and detecting
crime, and collecting revenue, (which
seem to be the great works of govern-
ment, the one to protect government,
the other to pay for protecting, and to
institute such internal improvements
as shall promote the interests of the
people,) to have been so managed as to
have almost made the government a
clog, rather than a stimulus to indus-
try and progress, a fetter to keep
down rather than a plume to produce
boyant hope and enterprize.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Yet we are happy to say the king
in this department, instituted an or-
der of things, which while it does not
immediately disturb old laws and old
regulations, will gradually undermine
the old and introduce a better way.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The king has taken the trouble to
introduce a foreign master of police
with a liberal salary, and a police force,
that had been trained in the nearest
English port Singapore.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He has tried this police force for
several years, and seemingly pleased
with its operations, he is now esta-
blishing a native police on the same
model, all the officers and the police
force to be from Siamese subjects.
This is as it should be. If a country
wishes to be strong, it must be self re-
liant as fast as possible.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Yet when we say subjects, we do
not mean what may be called pure
Siamese: we mean the native born, and
those who have adopted the country
and expect always to live here, to edu-
cate and rear their children here, and
here to live. We would think it good
policy to introduce this people as fast
as possible to all the privileges and
powers of Siamese subjects. We be-
lieve the Laos, Cambodians, Cochin-
Chinese, Chinese, Malays, Peguans,
&c. &c. would make just as good sub-
jects as those in whom flow what is
called Siamese blood. This latter class
are already almost entirely a fusion
of races, and why not admit the pure
races at once and give them the pro-
tection and advantages of subjects and
make it for their interest to seek the
advancement of their adopted country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When people adopt a new country
which gives them better sources of
livelihood and improvement than their
own country, they owe it more grati-
tude, and if they adopt it, will stand
by it to the death even to the detri-
ment of their mother country. There
need be no fear they will be treacher-
ous, if they are protected and justly
promoted. I now mean of course, as
a gradual measure, with appropriate
restrictions and conditions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}America is a noble example in this
department. Scotch and Irish, Ger-
mans French and English, Spanish
Italians and Portuguese, Swedes Danes
and Russians, join hands amicably and
call themselves a great nation, greater
than all their ancestry, and on a high-
er better platform of government. We
wish the same joining of the eastern
races in Siam and the same success.
We think it possible, feasible and
desirable.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are glad the native population
have so good a leader in the English-
man who now stands at the head of
the police force, which is to give pro-
tection to this city of multifurious ra-
ces. An official with a beam in his
eye cannot see clearly to pull the
mote from his brother's eye, or a
breaker of law be a fearless champion
for rectitude, lest some culprit should
turn upon him with “thou that sayest
a man should not steal, dost thou
steal.” Our European police master
is exemplary. His residence is neatly
and thriftily kept. His wife tidily and
tastefully keeps her house and house-
hold, and they are church-goers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such a man is doubly effective. He
acts by precept and example, and can
thus speak and act advisedly, for he
has experience. He can say come and
go with us, and we will do you good.
Leave your bad ways, adopt a true
course, and be an honest exemplary,
happy man. It is possible. It is ne-
cessary to progress and happiness.
Sin leads downward and destruction-
ward.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But while the European policeman
is well paid and exemplary, he has a
great vantage ground over the native
officials as "a terror to evil doers."
He has a good salary, and can afford
to deal justly and fearlessly. Before
the treaties with the western nations
the revenue was so meager, or rather
there was so much absorbed by royal
ty, there was little left for subordinate
officers' salaries, which were almost
nominal and hence bribery, & oppres-
sion took the place of justice and pro-
tection in departments of business.
Hence it became a usage to give small
salaries and make up the deficit by
perquisites. Judges and the whole
phalanx connected with the righting of
wrongs have become the greatest wrong
doers. They were driven by necessi-
ty to take bribes to live.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We come from a country well gov-
erned, where officials have delegated
power, and means to help them fully
meet the expense in any way which
government may arrange that shall
meet conveniently the wishes of the
officials, and officially and justly admi-
nister the government. The officials
are liberally salaried for their onerous
duties, and to receive a bribe or em-
bezzle the public revenue is a great
crime.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Protection and stimulus to every
laudable enterprize is the watchword
of government, supposed infringements
of law after a fair trial are decided up-
on by a large jury supposed to be im-
partial, and the penalties of law
promptly, efficiently and judiciously
executed, both to reform the offender,
and as an example to make the lawless
fear. When the guilt is certain, it be-
comes the duty of government to see
it though in all its bearings, punish-
ing the wrong and seeing it as far as
possible righted. Paying the cost of
trial falls entirely on the offender as
well as remunerating the injured.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Siam at present, has little of this
efficiency. Let an illustration show
the difference. A man was caught
stealing. It was an undoubted fact
though of small amount. The owner
of the stolen property made over the
thief to proper authorities, asking for
justice. Months afterward a messen-
ger came to him from prison saying
the poor wretch was pining in prison
and chains on the brink of the grave.
What in chains still! was the exclama-
tion. Yes, was the reply. It is the
custom of the country. He will stay
till he dies if no friend comes to the
rescue. Let the poor fellow go, was
the order of the injured party, and so
he was set free perhaps to pursue his
old course for he had nothing but
chains to make him better.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We need a Howard here beyond
measure, to visit the prisons, represent
their defects, and show the working of
the present measures. The king is
the father of his subjects, he wishes
all the people to be good and happy,
and should so arrange all his measures
as to secure these results. Punish-
ment should be prompt, just, and al-
ways and every where for the good of
the whole people. It should not be
the policy to destroy but to save.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is another feature here which
is very disheartening in the party
seeking justice. In the developements
of the infringements of law, prominent
men often become implicated, and the
policy of government seems to be to
shield them and substitute a scape-
goat. If we want a country to pros-
per, justice must be done though the
sky falls. That is, justice must be
known and the penalty affixed. Af-
ter sentence is passed, pardon becomes
possible, or an amelioration adjusted.
Murder may, for example, be commuted
to imprisonment for life; or a king
may set a culprit free for sufficient rea-
sons. But law must take its course,

Domestic Animals.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
CHAPTER V.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In our last article under this head we
wrote of the Tookhaa. Our friend A Res-
ident intimates that it is a monstrous
perversion of language to class this
creature, being so much like a croco-
dile, and in fact belonging to the same
genns, among domestic animals. We
confess that he has a great hanndle to
his ideas, but it appears to us as much
out of proportion to the thing he
wishes to wield by it as a hanndspike
to a jack knife. With far more pro-
priety might he say that it is out-
rageous to call a dog a domestic ani-
mal because he belongs to the wolf
tribe, or that a cat must be ex-
cluded from the same category be-
cause he stands gennerically among
lions. But we are only playfully re-
plying to our correspondent in this
writing, having caught the spirit from
him. We are thankful for his artiele
as it was written in a good spirit, and
has brought out more of the nature
and characteristies of the animal
under diseussion than we had thought
of.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We propose now to write on an-
other animal under the same general
head, which it may be thought, even
less worthy of a place among domes-
tic animals than the Tookhaa. We
refer to the crow or raven. Lexicog-
raphers seem to make some little
distinction betweon a raven and a
crow, but we confess to an inability
to discover it, and shall content our-
selves with considering the two names
as synonymous terms. To persons
born and brought up in the Western
world, especially in America, as yet
unacquainted with the crow of this
Eastern world, the idea of classing
this bird among domestic animals
must seem very strange. And we
fancy we hear them exclaiming even
now, what, call one of the wildest
and shyest birds in all creation a
domestic animal! It is absurd. Not
quite so fast gentle reader. Wait a lit-
tle and we will show you that the nature
of the crow is wonderfully changed
in this Eastern world of wonders.
And here we would frankly say, that
if it be essential to the idea of domes-
tic, that the creature to which the term is
applied should live in human dwellings,
then we can not properly denominate
our crow of Siam a fully domesticated
animal. The term is only applicable
to it in the sense of living about our
houses, frequenting our verandahs or
corridors, and occasionally, when it
gets a good opportunity, darting into
our dining room, alighting on our
table while being prepared for a meal,
and grabbing what it can most ex-
peditiously get hold of, it may be a
bit of fowl, or duck, or pork, or pota-
toe, or bread, or cake, or even a silver
spoon, or fork, if there be the smell
of food upon it. The creature is so
quick on the wing, and so expert at
dodging, that it is next to impossible
to catch it, or hit it by any thing you
fling at it in the act of thieving. And
if you attempt to shoot it while in
sight of you, it darts away the mo-
ment you begin to take aim at it.
Its nature has endowed it with a great
wariness of all pointing towards it.
When the bird comes and lights on
the verandah railing, within eight or
ten feet of your table, to have a look
at you is eating, and to see if by
hook or by crook it may not get a
bit of something to eat, and runs over
the bare [?] lessons to curry favor
with you, with even more graceful
genuflexions than the politest French-
men, you have only to raise a knife or
fork or simply the hand and point it
towards the creature, and it spring to
its wings in an instant. The bird seems
to know well that a bow and
string with an arrow attached to it, is
an instrument of death, and hence
fancies that its life is in danger when
near to it. Consequently a bow and
arrow hung up in the door way or
window opening is one of the best
Scare-crows we have. The next best
is a wing of a crow suspended by a
string, and the next a bit of black
rag or a few strings having some
slight resemblance to a net work,
stretched across your door-way, or
near any thing that you would pro-
tect against their depredations. Our
housewives are greatly annoyed by the
crows stealing away their yeast put
out to dry in the verandah, or their
dough placed in the sun to rise. A
white napkin spread over it is not
enough, for they will pull it off and
away with both your bread and
yeast.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is interesting to observe the wis-
dom or canning of our crows in saving
the fragment of food which they have
over and above what they need for the
present meal. They will fly away
with it to some lonely place on the
tiled or thatched roof of another
house near by, and carefully stow it
away under some tile or leaf of attap,
keeping their eyes out continually
against observers of their own kind.
Should a crow thus engaged espy an-
other crow not in partnership with
itself looking at it, it will abandon
the place and seek a better one for its
purposes.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Our Siamese crows become wonder-
fully intimate with our infant children.
Put your creeping baby in your ver-
amiah, or in the door way with a piece
of bread and butter, and very likely
if left alone a few minutes a crow
perched on a roof or tree near by,
watching its opportunity, will dart
down and alight first on the railing
eight or ten feet distant; and then
hopping a foot at a time un-
til within four feet, will venture to
take its stand on the floor before the
child; and then, if it sees no danger
nigh, will very genteelly step up and
take the morsel out of the hand of
the child, or even out of its lips. In-
deed our little children who are able
to walk, often become so intimate
with the crows, that they call them to
them, and the birds come and take it
out of their hands.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our Siamese crows have another
habit which we never noticed in the
western world, and that is, when one
of their number has been killed by a
shot, they will come together in scores
and even hundreds, under great exci-
tement, jabbering to the top of their
voices, as if intent at all hazards to
take vengeance on the author of the
murder of their fellow.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are myriads of crows that have
their homes in and about this city,
and they perform invaluable service
as scavengers of this great metropolis.
In the day time they are scattered all
about. You can scarcely look out a
moment without seeing some of them.
But as it grows dark in the evening,
they love to flock together by hun-
dreds, and take up their lodgings on
two or more trees in some temple
ground. They have one grand Ho-
tel near our dwelling. It is common
for them to have a season of the freest
jabbering on getting settled for the
night, and being very shy, the least
unusual noise in the vicinity will start
them all to their wings in wonderful
harmony, and they will fly hither and
thither about the neighborhood, every
one talking incessantly in its own
way a few minutes until they all get
back again to their roost. They are
often times disturbed in this way
many times before they are quietly
settled for the night.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They make their nests in the tops
of trees about the temples and or-
chards of cocoanuts, betels, mangoes,
mangostiens, durians and other trees.
We frequently see their young ones
just beginning to take their first les-
sons in flying, tumbling down among
the bushes about our houses, the
mother crows coming after them,
greatly concerned for the welfare of
their young.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Siamese crows in other respects are
quite like the crows we were accus-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}tomed to see in our boyhood days
being of the same size, quite as
black and tidy, though they feed
much more on carrion than their broth-
ers in the western world.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}MR. EDITOR,-—In conversation with
an acquaintance a few days ago upon
the subject of total abstinence from all
intoxicating liquors, he quoted the oft
perverted passage where the Apostle
Paul advises Timothy, to "drink no lon-
ger water, but use a little wine for thy
stomach's sake and thine often infirmi-
ties," in support of moderate drink-
ing. This same passage is used by a
vast number in support of the drink-
ing usages of the present day; but the
true meaning of it is either unknown
to them, or else they willfully mis-
apply the whole passage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What was Timothy? Was he a
moderate drinker, or a total abstainer?
"Drink no longer water, but use a little
wine for thy stomach's sake" is Paul's
advice, thereby proving clearly that
Timothy was in the habit of drinking
water, and water only. Of what use
would it have been, supposing that
Timothy was a moderate drinker, for
Paul to have told him to "use a little
wine," when he was habitually using it?
The advice which Paul gave to Timo-
thy was perfectly appropriate to the
total abstainer, but to be given to a
moderate drinker it was entirely mis-
placed. I therefore conclude that Timo-
thy was a total abstainer in the strict-
est sense of the term. Paul's advice
to Timothy was to "use a little wine"
as medicine "for his stomach's sake
and his often infirmities" but I cannot
find one word that tells me that he
followed the advice, and even if he
did, that would not prove him to have
been a moderate drinker.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Does the moderate drinker know
that he is in danger of becoming a
drunkard? No man at the outset ever
intends to let himself sink so low in
the scale of being. He thinks that his
resolution is strong enough, and that
he is perfectly able to withstand all
the seductive influences of the intoxi-
cating cup. But once entered upon
the slippery path, he finds himself
quite powerless, and is carried onward
by the fatal current until he finds
himself sunk beneath the beast that
perishes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“The prince of this world,” has found
strong drink to be a most fruitful in-
strument in attaining his ends with
men when all his other arts are of
no avail; and through its all prevail-
ing power, he has reaped an abundant
harvest of souls for perdition. Strong
drink has proved itself to be man’s
greatest enemy, yet strange to say,
men are daily sacrificing health, wealth,
and happiness to indulge in it. The
majority of all classes of men, seem to
think that there is no true pleasure in
the absence of the wine cup. It is
fashionable to use it, and as a fashion
and a custom it draws thousands to its
shrine. But O the fearful end to
which it surely leads!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Slowly, but surely the demon alco-
hol gains upon its victim, until the
moderate drinker becomes the habi-
tual drunkard, and then what a sad
spectacle is he to look upon! See his
sunken blood-shot eyes, his withered
hands, his tottering gait. The very
children in the streets are laughing at
his bloated visage and haggard appear-
ance. He breathes God's pure air and
receives unnumbered blessings from
His bounteous hand, but no grateful
emotion fills his breast. He is fretful
and discontented with his lot in life,
and with every thing around him. I
ask, is there any thing in God's crea-
tion that presents so degrading an ap-
pearance as a drunken man? No, there
is not; for he degrades himself below
the level of the brute. He is lost to vir-
tue, his character is blasted and all his
prospects for this life are ruined; and
if he ever looks forward to the eternal
world, he sees the sentence recorded,
"drunkards shall not inherit the king-
dom of heaven," and sinks in despair.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But is there no remedy to save the
moderate drinker from becoming the
habitual drunkard, and of avoiding
the drunkard's fearful doom? There is
but one sure remedy, and that is ban-
ish forever the intoxicating cup from
him. "Touch not, taste not, handle
not," is the only safe ground upon
which the moderate drinker can hope
to stand secure, and successfully resist
the demon alcohol.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Would that every one of whatever
name or nation they may be, protes-
tant or papist, missionary or layman
in this benighted land, had the moral
courage to adopt, and the energy to
carry out the resolution of the Rev.
Dr. Scudder. "I would not allow a
heathen to see me take a glass of wine
for a kingdom." {{< news/indent4 >}} G.{{< /news/text >}}

near P’ooteinat. This vessel was bring-

who had escaped from a wreck at
Hainan last year. P’ooteinat is a Siam-

with two assistants as passengers on

Captain Buckholdt. It appears that
the government has especially in view
by his services a survey of the River
Mekong, independent of course of
the survey which the French have
undertaken, but no further, probably,
than where the river is in Siamese
territory. We hope he will be em-
ployed for a month or two at least in
surveying for a street on the western

Charon Kroong. We wish the gov-

{{< news/text >}}We learn that the Viceroy of
Egypt has come out against polyga-

his own family. This is a great and
grand stride in the way of moral im-

rulers have so long made it a high aim
of earthly glory to have princely har-
em.s. We trust that this illustrious
example will soon lead on to a great
reformation in that land which has for
hundreds of ages been cursed by poly-
gamy. Would that His Majesty the
king of Siam might see the great good
he would do, and the great glory he
would acquire by abolishing polyga-
my in his family! The harems of the
kings of Siam have from time imme-
morial made the crime honorable for
all, and all have consequently follow-
ed it to the utmost extent of their
ability; and it is now a terrible curse
in the land—-a vampire sucking out the
life blood of public morals. Oh that
the king would see and feel it! Then
would he come out against it by his
own example at least, and strike a
death blow to the curse. All his prin-
ces and rulers would honor him for it,
and many, if not all, would quickly
follow such an illustrious example,
and Siam would consequently take
immense strides towards high civiliza-
tion and honor. In this matter, as well
as in regard to religion, the king of
Siam has the most fearful responsibil-
ities resting upon him, and he will
sooner or later have to give an account
of them to the Judge of all the earth.{{< /news/text >}}

THE VIRGIN MARY SAVING A MURDERER.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Rome correspondent of the PALL
MALL GAZETTE gives the following details
of another attempt to impose upon the
credulity of the priest-ridden Romans.
The facts will best speak for themselves,
and but one feeling can be entertained
towards the murderer—that of regret
that so blood-stained a monster should
under any circumstances escape the just
penalty of his deeds :—"From an authen-
tic narrative we learn that Felix and An-
tonio di Guiseppe, or Ventura, brothers,
originally of Capitignano, in the Neapo-
litan provinces, were tainted with every
crime. By turns brigands on the high-
way and adroit sharpers in the towns,
they followed their vocation in every part
of the Pontifical territory, committing
felonies without number. Finally they
were both arrested, and were tried and
condemned to death by the Supreme
Tribunal of the Council. The pope re-
mitted the capital sentence on Felix, the
least guilty, commuting his punishment
to hard labor for life. It was impossible
to extend the same clemency to Antonio
di Guiseppe. He was accused of eleven
murders, committed in twenty-three years;
he confessed to five. He had cut off the
breasts of a young girl; and, more dread-
ful still, he was suspected of having as-
sassinated his own mother. The sentence
was that he should be beheaded at Brac-
ciano, the scene of his latest crime—the
murder of Pietro P.alini, a herdsman.
In the prison of the town, Antonio began to
evince great contrition, confessed to the
priest, and devoted himself to religious
duties, celebrating especially every day in
his dungeon the service of the "month
of Mary," in honor of the Holy Virgin.
On the eve of the day appointed for his
execution, he informed his confessor, with
an air of profound conviction, that the
Madonna had appeared to him and an-
nounced that she accepted his repentance,
and that he should not die on the scaffold,
but live to expiate his crimes, and be-
come one of her servants. This statement
he repeated when the officers came to
read his condemnation to him, at the
same time declaring that he richly deserved
his sentence, to which he listened without
the least discomposure. He asked per-
mission to walk to the scaffold barefoot;
and on his way thither, and even as he
mounted to the platform, he reiterated
his conviction that he should not be ex-
ecuted. He made the same statement to
the assembled crowd, asking their par-
don for his crime, but adding that he
would not bid them adieu. The people
listened in silence, thinking him mad,
and they were confirmed in this opinion
by the composed manner in which he
knelt down and offered his neck to the
axe. The executioner seized the handle
of the guillotine, which had been tried in
the night, and found to act effectively.
The cleaver, loaded with enormous
weights, now descended, but, wonderful
to relate, it stopped abruptly by two
fingers' length from the neck of the male-
factor. The executioner, resolute in his
duty, reset the apparatus; again the blade
fell, but it was again arrested at the same
point as by an invisible hand. Meanwhile
the spectators became excited beyond
control, and shouted "Pardon! pardon!"
while many leaped on the scaffold and
released the culprit by force. A courier
was dispatched to obtain his pardon of
the Pope, and it is confidently stated that
the Minister of the Interior has ordered
an inquiry as a step in this direction. The
miracle has, in the interim, made such
rapid progress as an article of faith, that
it has been recognized by the popular
poets, and this morning they were sing-
ing a recital of it at the corners of the
streets, and exhibiting in illustration pic-
tures coarsely daubed on linen, which
represented Antonio receiving a visit from
the Madonna in his dungeon, and then
his miraculous deliverance on the scaffold.
Such is the incident which now absorbs
the attention of Rome, and which has
been adroitly planned to catch the popular
fancy, to raise the courage of the brig-
ands, who behold one of their number
specially protected by the Madonna, and,
finally, to fill the coffers of the Govern-
ment.-—N. Y. OBSERVER.{{< /news/text >}}

that truth on which much skepticism
prevails, that Christianity, so received as
to become an integral part of a man, is

Palissy, or Buxton, or Budgett, or Per-

of a man's whole self'—as the one thing
which gives dignity and nobility to what
is in itself sordid and earthly—as the
mainspring of earnest and successful stri-
vings after loftier ends and a purer life—
as the power outside of and within man,
which, lifting up conduct in the individual,
raises the community—and not as a state
of mind mystical, and in active life unat-
tainable, high up among things intangible,
separated from contact with work-a-day
life, appropriate to Sabbath days and
special death-beds. Every man who is
'diligent in business, serving the Lord,'
is a sermon brimful of the energies of
life and truth, a witness to the compre-
hensiveness and adaptability of Christ's
religion, a preacher of righteousness in
scenes where none can preach so effec-
tively or so well."{{< /news/text >}}

Anecdote of Whitefield.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}George Whitefield stopped for several
days at the house of a general, at Provi-
dence, R. I. The general, his wife, his
son, and three daughters were serious but
not decidedly religious. Whitefield de-
parted from his usual custom, which was
to address the residents, in the house where
he staid, individually, concerning the wel-
fare of their souls. The last evening
came, and the late night he was to spend
there. He retired to rest; but the Spirit
of God came to him in the night, saying,
"O man of God! if these people perish,
their blood be on thy head." He listen-
ed; but the flesh said, "Do not speak to
these people; they are so good and kind,
that you could not say a harsh thing to
them." He rose and prayed. The sweat
ran down his brow. He was in fear and
anxiety. At last, a happy thought struck
him. He took his diamond ring from his
finger, went up to the window, and wrote
these words upon the glass—"One thing
thou lackest." He could not summon
courage to say a word to the inmates, but
went his way. No sooner was he gone,
than the general, who had a great vener-
ation for him, went into the room he had
occupied; and the first thing that struck
his attention was the sentence upon the
window, "One thing thou lackest." That
was exactly his case. The Spirit of God
blessed it to his heart.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}BEECHER OF BROOKLYN.—The largest
income of any minister in America is
probably that of Henry Ward Beecher, a
man of exuberant vitality, uncommon
sense, lively fancy, and ever ready wit,
and the most perfect type of American
independency. His congregation pay him
an annual salary of seven thousand dol-
lars—last year even over twelve thousand
dollars, and they may well do this, for
it is only about one-third of the income
from the pew rents, which are annually
sold at auction and sought for by thou-
sands eager to hear the extraordinary
orator, who, either as preacher or lecturer
on popular topics of the day, political,
moral, and religious, can gather the largest
audiences in the United States, and who,
though never rising above the popular
horizon, can clothe the feelings and ex-
periences of every day life with uncom-
mon freshness and interest. The resources
of his genius seem to be inexhaustible,
and his mind enjoys a perpetual spring.
Though he never quotes poetry, he is
full of poetry, and passionately fond of
flowers and of children. Though break-
ing through all the traditional notions
of clerical propriety, and turning the
pulpit into a rostrum, he interests thou-
sands of intelligent young men in vital
religion. He is a truly American pheno-
menon, which could only grow on Yankee
soil; yet I do not wonder that the "Life
Thoughts" from his sermons have, even
in Germany, found many admirers. I
only wish the whole man could be trans-
lated and multiplied into German and
French, to rouse the indifferent masses
of large cities to a sense of religion, as
the deepest and highest concern of life.

Admirably Illustrated.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are now multitudes of inquirers
who need to be dealt with as Mr. Patrick,
of Scotland, dealt with a women who had
been long anxious, but seemed to obtain
no relief.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Placing himself beside her and look-
ing steadily in her face, he said:”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Do you believe the Bible?””{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“I do,” she replied.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Can you tell me who made the
world?”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She smiled a little contemptuously, and
after a pause said:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“It was God.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To which he immediately replied,
“How d’ye ken? Were ye there to see?”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She seemed surprised, perceiving that
there was evidently more meant by the
question than she had supposed, and then
remarked:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“No, I was not there, but the word of
God says that he made it.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Ah, well, ye believe a’ the Bible says,
d’ye?”
She said, "Yes."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Ah, well we'll see. "This is my be-
loved Son, in whom I am well pleased;
hear ye him." Who says that ?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The Father."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Weel, will ye do as the Father bids
ye? He commands ye to hear the Son."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To this she assented.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Weel, then, what does the Son say?
"Him that cometh unto Me I will in no
wise cast out." "Come unto me, and I
will give you rest." To the woman in the
gospel he said, "Daughter, thy sins, which
are many, are forgiven thee;" and will
he not say the same to you? Is he not
saying it even the now? Ye dinna believe
that; ye dinna believe him. I tell ye, ye
dinna believe a' the Bible."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She instantly saw the shame and sin of
not trusting in a promising, present Re-
deemer, and instantly ventured on His
mercy and found the peace she sought.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}LIFE.—-As incessantly as the river flows
toward the ocean, does time flow towards
eternity; as fast as a bark glides along
with the stream, does man float with the
stream of time until emerging into eterni-
ty. Time is the perishing part of duration.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}NEVER.—-Esteem any man, or thyself,
the more for money, nor think the meaner
of thyself, or another, for the want of it;
virtue being the just reason of respecting,
and the want of it slighting any one. A
man, like a watch, is to be valued for his
goings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}GOOD AND EVIL.—-The knot of our life
is of a mingled yarn—-good and evil to-
gether; our virtues would be proud if our
faults whipped them not, and our crimes
would despair, if they were not cherished
by our virtues.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We often make life unhappy by wish-

they do, merely because that is possible
to the imagination which is impossible to
