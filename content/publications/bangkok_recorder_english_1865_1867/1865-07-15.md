Bangkok July 15th.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Since our last issue the celebration of
the 4th has been the principle local event, at
least so far as Americans are concerned. The
programme of the day has been given pretty
fully already, elsewhere, still we shall ven-
ture to give it again briefly. The proces-
sion which was to come off at 10 A. M. did
not take place until nearly noon, which
made it just in the heat of the day. The
tide was also ebbing very rapidly which
made it very difficult to keep boats in pro-
cession on the river. That part of the
performances might have been dispensed with
without detracting from the other exercises
of the day. The audience met in the
Chapel of the Presbyterian Mission, and
the exercises were opened with the reading
of Scripture and prayer. The whole Ameri-
can community was present, and also the
Consuls of the other Treaty Powers, and
very many of the other European residents.
After prayer and singing the "Glorious day
of Liberty," the "Declaration of Indepen-
dence," was read by G, W, VIRGIN Esq.
U. S. Vice Consul.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Although this document was made and
signed eighty nine years ago, and has long
since been recorded as a great historical
event, we were surprised to find that but
few of the Englishmen here had ever seen
or read it. Having thus passed into history
it can be read any where by Americans,
and listened to by Englishmen of the pre-
sent generation, without any unpleasant
feeling. Besides, all candid Englishmen
acknowledge that George III. acted unwise-
ly in regard to the Colonies, and drove
them to take the steps they did. English
historians too, will acknowledge that the
declaration was an act which has been
largely conducive to the best interests of
humanity. The reading of it might have
been dispensed with, on the 4th, but it
would have appeared to Americans like
ignoring their "Magna Charta."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The address on the occasion was extem.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}poraneous but appropriate, and will likely
be reproduced and printed in pamphlet
form. "Hail Columbia" was then sung
and President Lincoln's Emancipation pro-
clamation read. "The Flag of America"
was then sung, and President Lincoln's last
inaugural read. "The Star Spangled Ban-
ner" was then sung, after which a series of
resolutions, expressive of the sentiments of
Americans here were adopted. The exercises
were then closed with prayer. After retiring
from the chapel the audience partook of a
collation prepared by the American ladies.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Fireworks had been ordered for the
evening, and almost the entire European
community assembled at the residence of
F. Blake Esq. at 8 o'clock p. m. to witness
them. After the fireworks were over they
all partook of a repast which Mr. Blake had
prepared for the occasion, The whole affair
passed off very agreeably, and creditably
to all. We are glad to be able to say that
there was nothing like intoxication or im-
proper conduct during the whole perform-
ance. Americans have often been charged
(and sometimes justly) with exhibiting a
little too much "spread eagle" on Inde-
pendence day, but we think the present
occasion is free from any such charge.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A paper coming from very high authority,
and addressed to the American citizens and
the Newspapers here, throws upon the con-
ductors of those papers the "onus probandi"
that the United States is as great a country
as Americans say it is.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This paper has been translated and print-
ed by our contemporary, so we need not re
publish it. The task assigned to us we do
not care to undertake for several reasons.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would be difficult to prove to a man
born blind, that there are seven primary
colors in the rainbow, and that neither
nature nor art has produced any thing else
to equal it in beasty. It would be equally
difficult to prove to one whose ideas
scarcely gone beyond the limits of his own
small Kingdom, that America, lying twelve
thousand miles distant, on the other side of
the globe, is the greatest country in the
world, how much soever Americans may
believe it to be so. It would even be difficult
for him to conceive its vast area in
square miles.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He also says, he does not wish to read
"Lengthy articles which do not refer to
things present." If then he is unwilling to
go back to first causes it is impossible for
him to understand the nature of the rebellion
which has raged for the last four years
in the United States, and which has been
so successfully put down. Again the writer
of the article is so taken up with such titles
as "Majesty, Imperial, &c.," that it would
be difficult for him with his present feelings,
to comprehend or appreciate, the workings
of such a government as that of the United
States, where such titles have really no
meaning. He has also a set of correspon-
dents in London and elsewhere, upon whom
he relies implicitly for his information, and
who are either not capable of informing
him correctly upon the affairs of the United
States, or do not wish to do so. For in-
stance, in a letter to one of the Consuls here,
he says that his London correspondent tells him,
that the assassination of President Lin-
coln is only an indication, that the rebellion
is about to break out in a new place. So
long then as he trusts implicitly for his
information to such sources, it is useless for
us to inform him to the contrary.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The best way to dispel his doubts in re-
gard to the United States, would be to
send an Embassy to that government, and
we think, now that the war is over this gov-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ernment of the United States will renew
its application for an embassy from the
court of Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In that embassy there should be at least
one of those who have already been to
Europe. That one too, should be a per-
son like the worthy Lieut. Gov. of Pet-
chaburee, or the present International judge,
who would not be carried off with the fol-
lies—the "Kan len" of the country, or its
brandy, but would be capable of examin-
ing into the workings of the government
and the internal improvements of the coun-
try, and of comparing them impartially with
what they saw in Europe.{{< /news/text >}}

Resolutions.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolutions: passed at the 89th anni-
versary of American independence, cele-
brated at Bangkok July 4th 1865.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whereas we the American citizens resid-
ing in the Kingdom of Siam, are met to day
for the purpose of appropriately celebrating
this the 89th anniversary of our national
independence, we also consider it expedient
to give some expression of our sentiments
upon such an occasion, Therefore—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved 1st-—That while far from our
native land we still glory in our birthright
as American citizens, and having sym-
pathised in our country's struggles and sor-
rows, we now rejoice in her triumphs and
restored prosperity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved 2d-—That whilst slavery has
hitherto been a blot upon our national es-
cutcheon, we to day look with unmingled
pleasure upon the banner of our country,
and with exultant joy behold its unstained
folds waving over "the land of the free and
the home of the brave."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved 3d—That whilst we enjoy the
protection of our national flag in a foreign
country, we pledge ourselves to honor it,
and the country we represent.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved 4th-—That while we honor the
Rulers of our land who have stood by her
constitution and executed her laws—and the
patriotic statesmen who have defended our
national rights against foreign encroach-
ments and domestic insurrection—-and those
valiant commanders who have led forth
armies and our fleets to conflict and victory
—and those noble men who have so gener-
ously sacrificed their lives on the altar of
their country-—we recognize also with
special interest those heroic women who
have in all times of our country's peril, with
such unflinching patriotism, given up their
husbands and brothers, their sons and fath-
ers for liberty and their country's life, and
have roused with untiring faithfulness the
sick and the wounded, among our soldiers
and sailors.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved 5th-—That in the midst of our
Jubilant exultations over the recent triumphs
of our army and navy-—we bow with pro-
found humiliation and sorrow, before that
mysterious Providence which has brought
our late President, Abraham Lincoln, to
his tragical end, and left us to mingle our
tears with a nation in mourning, while re-
gardless of political creeds and party dis-
tinctions with one accord we cherish with
hallowed memory the varied excellencies of
our late Chief Magistrate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Resolved 6th—-That in our National In-
dependence which to day we celebrate, as
well as in the deadly strife from which we
have been so recently delivered, we recog-
nise the merciful interposition of Almighty
God, to whom belongs our devout thanks.
given, and all the glory.{{< /news/text >}}

American Generals.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 107)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gen. Grant's rising star was nigh culmi-
nating however at Shiloh or Pittsburg Land-
ing. After Donelson he did not remain long
idle. He transported his troops down the
Cumberland, and up the Tennessee to Shi-
loh. Jeff Davis had sent Beauregard and
Albert S. Johnston, his two crack Generals
at the time to arouse the friends of the Con-
federacy in the west. Johnston was the sen-
ior in command. Grant's head quarters were
at Shiloh. Gen. Buell was crossing the coun-
try to join Grant. The rebels were at Corinth
They conceived the bold plan of surprising
Grant, bagging his army and munitions of
war, and seizing the steamers in the river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Great blame was at the time heaped upon
Grant for allowing himself to be surprised,
but from which he has long since been ex-
erated. It is certain however that he did
not expect an attack, but such an attack to
any other one than Grant, would have been
ruinous. It is said by those present that he
reconnoitered in person on the previous even-
ing before retiring to his head quarters, and
had left orders for a signal gun to be fired
should there be any indications of an attack.
Early on Sabbath morning the rebels advanc-
ed in the twilight and whilst many of the
Union soldiers were in their beds asleep, the
bullets of the enemy came whizzing around
them. We give the scene of the battle in the
language of an eye witness. "But where is
Grant? Boom! Boom! I went the signal gun
ordered in case of an attack. He instantly
ordered his horses and trains to be made
ready. He sent a messenger to Buell ten
miles distant and in an hour and a quarter
was at the head of the army.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The noble Sherman had already ridden
with the speed of the wind over the field of
chaotic strife, and stemmed the tide of
disaster.  I shall not attempt to give you
the exact aspect of the field, but the general
result, especially Gen. Grant's part in the
fortunes of the day. He found the fresh
troops of Prentiss' routed. Indeed the
entire front was broken in and crushed back
a mile. The mad and proud surges of rebel-
lion after carrying on their crest the wrecks
of Prentiss' and Mc. Clennand's commands
dashed against that of Wallace. A shell cut
open Gen, Johnston's thigh and he was
borne to the rear to bleed to death, whilst
the terrible blow was concealed from his
troops. All the while Gen, Grant was
breasting the wild tumult of panic, and in-
vasion, causing the arrest of a dozen fright-
ened field officers who were flying and
crying we are "whipped let every one who
can save himself". With Gen. Sherman
to second every movement he held and
reorganized the tumultuous masses of sol-
diery for then long hours of bloody carnage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At length there is a chance for the gun
boats on the river, and then globes of iron
and imprisoned fire go shrieking and bursting
up the ravine down which Gen. Bragg's
forces were moving by order of Beauregard
to drive the broken columns of our army
into the river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Destruction rides upon the awful storm of
batteries protected by and acting in concert
with the gun boats. About noon Gen,
Buell reached the ground in advance of his
troops. He asked Gen. Grant what pro-
visions he had made for retreat in case of
defeat. "I am not going to be defeated"
replied Grant. "Such an event is possible"
added Buell "and it is the duty of every
prudent General to provide for such a con-
tingency." Grant pointed to the transports
quietly asking "Don't you see those boats"
"Yes but they will not carry more than
10,000 men and we have 30,000." "Ten
thousand is more than I intend to retreat
with" replied Grant.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the sun hung low in the sky of
that Sabbath day he sent his beams aslant
through the murky atmosphere, and along
the ghastly heaps of dead. "We shall hold
them yet" said Grant but scarcely any
besides himself believed it. Whatever
others may have thought then or still think
Gen. Grant expected to come unconquered
out of the dire confusion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is a commotion on the opposite
bank and then a shout; Buell's troops are
in sight. The boats cross over and receive
the timely reinforcements. Monday's sun
streaked with herald beams the east, when
Gen. Grant with Buell's army added, antici-
pated Beauregard, (whose intention it was
to fall upon the Union troops and gain the
landing,) and ordered an attack. The fan-
cied annihilator of Gen. Grant was met by
Nelson on whose front the gunboats had
driven the rebels back. For an hour the
doubtful struggle raged, till Mendenhall's
battery came up and poured in the grape.
* * The rebels intoxicated with whis-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}key in which was dissolved gun powder,
and recklessly confident of driving our
troops into the Tennessee shouted along
the lines "Bull Ran; Bull-Run;" and
when our troops prevailed they shouted"
"Fort Donelson; Fort Donelson;" Gen.
Grant and staff who had been recklessly
riding along the lines during the entire
day amid the unceasing storm of bullets,
grape, and shell, now rode from right to
left inciting the men to stand firm. About
8 o’clock in the afternoon he rode to the
left, where the fresh regiments had been
ordered and finding the rebels wavering,
sent a portion of his body guard to the
head of each of the five regiments and or-
dered a charge across the field, himself
leading, and as he brandished his sword
and waved them on to the crowning victory,
the cannon balls were falling like hail a-
round him. The men followed with a shout
tht sounded above the roar of artillery;
and the rebels fled in dismay as from a des-
troying avalanche and never made another
stand."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Jealousy and hate together with a misap-
prehension of the facts were again aimed
at Gen. Grant's rising popularity. A com-
mittee among whom were the governors
of some of the states again waited upon
Gen. Halleck and asked for the removal of
Grant, urging the loss of life at Shiloh and
also declared him wanting in capacity and
sobriety.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Hon. E.B. Washburn of Illinois, de-
fended Gen. Grant from the detractions of
his enemies in an eloquent speech upon the 
floor of Congress.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I come before the house to do a great 
act of justice to a soldier in the field, and
to vindicate him from the obloquy and
misrepresentation so persistently and cruel-
ly thrust before the country. I refer to a
distinguished general who has recently
fought the bloodiest, and hardest battle
ever fought on this continent, and won
one of the most brilliant victories. I mean
the battle of Pittsburg Landing and Major
Gen. U. S. Grant. Though but forty years
old he has been oftener under fire and been
in more battles than any other man on this
continent, except that Great Chieftain now
reposing on his laurels and on the affections
of his countrymen, Lieutenant Gen. Scott.
He was in every battle in Mexico that it
was possible for any one man to be in. He
has received the baptismal fire. No young
officer came out of the Mexican war with
more distinction than Grant, and the re-
cords of the war department bear official
testimony to his gallant and noble deeds.
He resigned in 1855 and afterwards settled
in Galena the district I have the honor to
represent on this floor. I came here to
speak of an Illinoisan, proud of his noble
and patriotic state, proud of its great his-
tory now being made up, proud above all
earthly things of her brave soldiers, who
are shedding their blood upon all the bat-
tle fields of the Republic. If the laurels of
Grant shall ever be withered it will not be
done by the Illinois soldiers who, have fol-
lowed his victorious banners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But to the victory of Pittsburg Landing
which has called forth such a flood of de-
nunciation upon Gen. Grant. When we con-
sider the charges of bad generalship, incom-
petency and surprise do we not feel that
even the joy of the people is cruel? Also to
the question whether there was or not what
might be called a surprise. I will not argue
it, but even if there had been Gen. Grant is 
not responsible for it, for he was not sur-
prised. He was at his head quarters 
when the fight commenced. His head quarters
were in the proper place for the command-
ing general at the time. He visited Pitts-
burg Landing and all the important points
every day. The attack was made on Sun-
day morning by a vastly superior force. In
five minutes after the first firing was heard
Gen. Grant and staff were on their way to
the battle field, and instead of not reaching
the field till 10 oclock, or as has been still
more falsely represented until noon, I have
a letter before me from one of his aids who
was with him, and who says he arrived
there at 8 oclock in the morning, and im-
mediately assumed command. There he
directed the movements, and was always
on that part of the field where his presence
was most required, exposing his life and
evincing in his dispositions the genius of
the greatest commanders.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With what desperate bravery that battle
of Sunday was fought! What display of
prowess and courage! What prodigies of
valor! Our troops less than 40,000 strong
attacked by 80,000 of the enemies picked
troops and led by their most distinguished
generals.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is no more temperate man in the
army than Gen, Grant. He never indulges
in the use of intoxicating liquors at all. He
is an example of courage, honor, fortitude,
activity; temperance and modesty, for he
is as modest as he is brave and incorruptible.
To the bravery and fortitude of Lannes he
adds the stern republican simplicity of
St. Cyr. It is almost vain to hope that full
justice with ever be done to men who have
been thus attacked. Truth is slow upon
the heels of falsehood. It has well been
said that falsehood will travel from Maine
to Georgia, while truth is putting on her
boots. Let no gentleman have any fears
of Gen, Grant, he is no candidate for the
presidency. He is no politician. Inspired
by the noblest patriotism, be only desiress
to do his whole duty to his country. When
the war is over he will return to his home
and sink the soldier in the citizen."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Soon after Pittsburg Landing came the
seige of Corinth. Gen Halleck was present
in person. The rebels evacuated the place,
but Halleck afterwards acknowledged that
if he had followed Grant's suggestions he 
might have captured the whole rebel forces.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Vicksburg the Gibraltar of the Mississippi 
was the next place of attack. Toward this
Grant now directed his columns and here 
he made his reputation. Vicksburg stands
in a great bend in the Mississippi. The first 
thing tried was to cut a canal across the
bend and change the channel of the river 
leaving Vicksburg inland, but this proved
a failure. Gen. Grant had not yet reached 
the city in person. The seige was then
apparently raised and a shout of defiance 
went up from the rebel fortress. An-
other accident occurred which frustrated 
another plan of Grant's and caused sev-
eral weeks delay. Colonel Murphy left in 
charge at Holly Springs allowed himself
to be surprised. Gen. Sherman who had 
been left at Memphis carried out his part
of the plan, and made an unsuccessful at-
tack on Vicksburg. Gen. Grant moved his
head quarters to Vicksburg. Lake Provi-
dence is but a mile from the Mississippi and
a plan was formed of cutting a canal to
that lake and then passing out through
the bayous to the Red River, and thence
into the Mississippi below Vicksburg. After
reaching lake Providence. however it was
found that the waters were too low and the
plan was abandoned. Another wilder ex-
pedition was proposed by some one of go-
ing through the Yazoo pass leading from
the Mississippi to Cold Water and the Tal-
lahatchie rivers, and getting a passage for
troops to Hains' Bluff near the mouth of
the Yazoo river, but the rebels found is
out and sent a force to frustrate the plan.
Grant now undertook one of the boldest
and most hazardous things in the annals of
warfare.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He marches his troops across the bend
of the river whilst the gun boats and trans-
port run the batteries at Vickburg. This
accomplished he moved down the river to
Grand Gulf, took that and thence to Fort
Gibson, and there surprised the rebels. In
the mean time in order to divert the rebel
attention he sent Sherman up the Yazoo
pass to threaten Hains' Bluff, and Corwin
was sent along the Mobile and Ohio rail-
road to divert the attention in that direction.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After taking Raymond and Jackson he
threw his forces in the rear of Vicks-
burg. He makes an attack but fails. The
rebels in turn march out and attack him
but are severely repulsed. Seeing that the 
place could not be taken by storm without
great sacrifice of life, he established himself
for a regular seige. In the mean time the
rebel Gen, Joe, Johnston was collecting
troops and preparing to attack him in the
rear, and make him raise the seige. A
hundred times was it declared by the rebel
journals, and as often reiterated by sym-
pathizing journals in Europe, that Johnston
was just about to annihilate Grant. Grant
however had taken good care to prepare
for such an attack and had sent his favorite
Sherman to attend to Johnston. The fol-
lowing despatch from Gen. Pemberton to 
Gen. Johnston was captured, "I have 15000 
men at Vicksburg, and rations for thirty
days—one meal a day. Come to my aid
with 80,000 men,—attack Grant in the
rear. If you can't do it within ten days
you had better retreat, Ammunition is al-
most exhausted particularly percussion
caps." Many other despatches, and private
letters were captured, all desponding but
hoping Johnston would soon come to there
relief Grant wrote to Sherman "They
seem to put great confidence in the Lord
and Joe Johnston but you must whip John-
ston at least fifteen miles from here." John-
ston however kept out of the way of Sherm-
an. Days pass on and at last Pemberton
unable to hold out any longer surrendered
July 4th 1863. Grant's reputation was
made. After the fall of Vicksburg some
of the complaining gentlemen called on
President Lincoln when the following con-
versation took place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"So Grant drinks whiskey to excess!"
remarked the President. "Yes" was the
reply. "What whiskey does he drink?"
asked Mr Lincoln.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"What whiskey!" doubtfully enquired
the gentlemen.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Yes, is it Bourbon or Monongahela?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why do you ask Mr President?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Because if it makes him gain such
victories as Vicksburg I will send a demi-
john of the same kind to every General in
the army.{{< /news/text >}}

Tour to the Hot Springs.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
( Continued from page 120 )
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the first excitement of finding
and examining the Hot Springs began to
flag at about 10 o'clock A. M., we then be-
came somewhat impatient for the ar-
rival of our "staff of life" which we had
left in our rear far beyond our call. In-
deed we then learned, with surprise, that
the bearers of it were left to start from the
Karen village after we did; and hence a
multitude of queries arose, as for example;
have they, Siamese like, delayed an hour
or two in starting! Is it not possible that
they have mistaken our breakfast for our
dinner? Have they missed the way as we
did, and not been favored with a stranger
to set them right, as we were. Shall we
have to wait till noon for our breakfast, and
then, possibly, be obliged to return for it
to the Karen village in the evening.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was too hot to rove about in search of
geological specimens or other curiosities.
The terrible "sun stroke" menaced us by
all the openings of the leafless limbs. To 
find a tolerable shade was then a great de-
sideratum to every one of us. We tried
one and another and another, lying down
in each successively.  But there was no
abiding confidence to be placed in any
shade of trees, because the sun could not
be made to "stand still," and look down in
one direction only.  He would gaze through
the crevices of the thin leaves upon us,
and upon favoring this spot, anon with the
sweet veiling of his beams.  But we found
his favors so narrow and evanescent that
we soon abandoned all hopes of comfort
from them, and unanimously resolved to
convert a certain wild beast's lair, under a
low bower of bushes and thorny vines, close
by the spring, into a human lodging place.
Calling to our aid our Karen attendants,
armed with their short swords and the
bushman's knife and cleaver, we cut out
the thorns, and hewed down the little
stumps, and scraped off the old leaves; and
then spreading down our mats and blankets
we crawled into the place, hoping to get
each a little nap out of sight of the sun our
subtle persecutor.  But it proved to be but
a miserable protection from the vertical
beams, for the bushes and vines, though
quite thick, had but few leaves, and the ar-
bors was so arranged above and around us as to
precede all hope of cleansing the shade by any
screens that we could put up.
    Our circumstances were especially trying
to our invalid companion, who had been 
seized with the dysentery in the early morn-
ing, and was then suffering so much pain from 
it. But our merciful Heavenly Father 
had taken care to provide a remedy for 
him even in that wild Karen jungle. He 
had put it into the heart of one of our
number, and he not a physician, to bring
with him a few doses of "Dover Powder."
Of this we administered to him from ten
to fifteen grains, which produced speedy
and great relief.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At 11 o'clock our stewards arrived
with the box of food and goblet of water
swinging between them. Their coming was
hailed with shouts of joy. But it was soon
discovered, that not only the guns had
been left behind, but also the teakettle.
And we all felt, that in our circumstances,
tea was almost as important to our health
and comfort as food. How then shall we
make our tea! was the earnest enquiry.
Through natures teakettle was boiling splen-
didly close at our feet, we were at first too 
stupid to think that we might borrow a
little of its crystal water in which to infuse
our tea leaves. Hence we all set our wits
to work in all other directions to devise
some substitute for a teakettle. If we were
among any human habitations we might
borrow an earthen rice pot for the purpose.
But no such hope was allowed us. It was
proposed to try our goblet. But no, that
would break by the first touch of the fire.
As necessity is wont to become the moth-
er of invention, so now we were going to
see that edge verified. Our guide, one of
the most stupid of men, as it seemed to us,
proposed that we buil water in a section of
bamboo. The thought at first seemed pre-
posterous. But a little reflection reminded 
us that the natives bake cakes in such ves-
sels, and why not boil water, for a joint of
bamboo is water tight, and while green it 
is with the greatest difficulty made to burn.
It was a unanimous vote to try the virtues
of such a teakettle. A native cut down a
bamboo tree of middling size and cut off
one joint of it for the purpose. It had a
calibre of three inches diameter, and was 
about fourteen inches in length. Being 
filled with water, it was placed in a leaning
posture against a stone, and then a fire was
made under its lower side. The experi-
ment was completely successful, and the water
was quickly boiling. But just at that junc-
ture another embarrassing discovery was 
made, which was, that we had no teapot.
(Strange to say, that then our inventive
faculties were too dull to think that anoth-
er joint of the same bamboo would have
made a good teapot.) There was only one
thing we could think of that could be made
to serve for one, and that was a slender tin
canister in which we had brought a little
sugar. This offered a fair hope of being all
that we needed. The sugar was turned out,
and the tea leaves and hot water turned in.
But here a third obstacle met us. The tea-
pot was found to leak not only at the top
but also at the bottom. Happily it was so
small a leak, that only about half of the
water escaped while the tea was steeping.
In this way we supplied ourselves, but too
slowly, with a very palatable and whole-
some beverage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The spirit of experimenting having be-
come dominant, it popped into the head of
one of the gentlemen, that we had been fools
up to that moment, in not considering
that we could make tea from the water al-
ready boiling in the Spring.  He at once
put a spoonful of tea leaves into a soda
water flask, and filling it with the hot wa-
ter left it to steep awhile directly where the
water comes rolling up from the sea of fire
beneath.  In less than ten minutes the
infusion became colored as usual in well
made tea, and was found to answer all the
purposes of that enlivening beverage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having finished our breakfast about
noon, we sent our Karen stewards back to
our lodgings bearing between them what
little remained, determining ourselves to wait
two or three hours, as best we could, and
then follow in the cooler part of the day.
We tried thoroughly the lair for a loung-
ing place, but found it fearfully close and
hot. Possibly imagination aided in getting
up the intensity of the heat; for superadded
to a cloudless sun streaming through our
bower, we had a large marsh of hot water
spread out before us, and an ocean of vol-
canic fire not many miles beneath us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}While thus waiting, one of our Karen
attendants brought to us a dead black
faced monkey which he had just shot with
a poisoned arrow from his cross-gun. The
arrow had entered his belly and produced,
as the archer affirmed, instant death. The
body appeared to have been convulsed by
the poison. Our archer had his quiver
full of arrows all tipped with a vegetable
poison. He said he was going to take the
monkey home and eat it. What, said one of
the gentlemen, eat flesh that has been pois-
oned to death! Yes said he, there is no
harm in it. In this the simple minded
hunter was doubtless correct, as the little
poison which was deadly when mingled
with living blood, becomes harmless when
taken into the stomach in connection with
the flesh whose life it has destroyed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We saw in this princely hunter (for he
was a son of a chief) many interesting
characteristics of the tribe to which he be-
longs. He was quite a good looking
young man, about five feet six inches in
hight, having black and keen eyes, with a
sprightly mind, quickly comprehending
what we said to him, and promptly and
aptly replying to the same. His costume 
was simply a p’anoong and a loose Jacket
I fancied that I could see in his mein some
likeness of Nimrod the great hunter. He
seemed to feel the utmost freedom in call-
ing all those wide extended jungles his
own.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In conversation with him, he said that
he had some weeks since, captured a re-
markable tortoise, having six legs, and
that it was still in his possession at home.
One of the gentlemen merchants, being
enthusiastically engaged in the honorable
service of procuring curiosities for Cam-
bridge College Mass, was delighted at the
intelligence and prompt in striking a bar-
gain, for the monster at almost any price
that? might be named. My readers may
perhaps hear of this creature again in con-
nection with a monster hog born with only
two legs, which we all had the pleasure of
seeing a few days before. Surely Siam is
wonderful for monstrosities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Being about to leave, we made other ob-
servations touching the Hot Springs. The
water boils out of a bluish lime stone rock
in a fractured state. Never before had
we seen water more perfectly clear. When
cooled it was as agreeable to the taste
as the water of Petenburee river, with
which it ultimately commingles. An an-
alysis of a bottle of it has proved, that it
is entirely free from mineral properties, thus
cutting off all hope of its ever becoming a
fashionable resort for invalids. when Siam
shall have become not a whit behind what
England now is.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We left the Springs about 4 o'clock p.
m. taking mainly the same track by which
we came. The beauty and sublimity of
our Father's handy-work in creation and
providence as manifested on the route, we
enjoyed even more than in the morning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How true, thought we, are the words of the
Preacher-—"He hath made every thing
beautiful in his time." About midway
from our I m and the Springs, we came to
a place of general rendezvous for teamsters,
who come from the Laos villages 20 or 30
miles East of it, to barter for Sapanwood.
It appeared to be a market place for this
dye wood. It was charmingly homely to
see the oxen eating straw out of the carts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We arrived at our Karen camp a little
after sunset, and were very sorry to find
that our affable and most hospitable land-
lord, had been seized with a fever in our
absence, and could not come out to see us.
The very extraordinary exertions he had
made the day and night before, to entertain
us in a style compatible with our great
dignity, had evidently been too much for
his slender frame. Two of our party went up
to his house to visit him in his affliction, and
to express unto him our gratitude for all
the attention he had shown us, and to pre-
sent to him a little silver bonus besides.
Our amateur curiosity-seeker became par
ticularly interested in the earrings of the
chieftain's wife. One of them was a block
of red-wood an inch in diameter, and the
other two inches, each nearly an inch thick
and solid. They looked much like some
wooden snuff-boxes. Seeing the curiosity
they had awakened, the chief had them at
once slipped out of their living bands, as
one would slip out a file of letters from an
India-rubber belt, and gave them to the
gentleman most interested in them. If the
ship don't become an entire wreck in
which they are to be forwarded to the U.
S. A. those Karen earrings will doubtless
attract the gaze of thousands at Cambridge.
Museum The bands by which they are
kept in their places on the ears, are made
by puncturing the lobe of the ears when
quite young, and the orifices gradually
enlarged by forcible extension, until they
will admit without pain such huge blocks
of wood.  Well has it been said that "there
is no accounting for taste."  These most
ugly looking ear-drops dangling nearly to
the shoulders, are by the Karen women ac-
counted ornamental.  So may any thing in
this world become ornamental if it be in
fashion.  The males also have their ears
bored and the orifice extended quite as
much as the females; but instead of solid
blocks of red wood for ear-drops, they
make them carry sections of bamboo for
cigar cases.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The dress of the Chief's wife reminded
us of the coat ear-drops that was "without seam,
woven from the top throughout" and every 
thread she wore was comprised in that 
garment extending from the shoulders to the 
knees.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As our plan was laid to depart thence 
the next morning at 1 o'clock, we took 
leave of our host at his sick bed before 
we retired to sleep.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}March 16th. Faithful to our appoint-
ment, we arose at 1 o'clock, and taking a
little lunch, and a cup of hot tea, we all
mounted our ponies, determining that we
would reach Petchaburee, a distance of
about 35 miles, before 7 o'clock, and this
feat we actually accomplished. But O!
how wearied we were, long before we
reached our destination—especially the
writer, whose pony was the largest of all
the seven, and had never been trained to
any gait but a hard walk, a shocking trot,
and a terrible gallop.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}7. On Sunday 28th May 1865 birth of 
a princess, the daughter of H. R. H. Prince 
Pramote Krom mun Worachark, the 26th 
Son of His Majesty the late King of Siam 
in the second reign of the present dynasty, 
and the eleventh half brother of the present 
King, and Master of the Royal Household.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In accordance with Siamese royal custom 
the birth of the descendants of royal blood, 
must be registered annually, previous to the 
payment of the annual salaries, to the gov-
ernment officials, &c. &c.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The offspring of the sons and daughters 
of the Sovereigns of Siam in any reign, 
have the title of Their Highness, without 
the prefix, Royal, that their parents have, 
who are called in Siamese Chanfas, and 
Phra Ong Chao, the paréts of the former 
being both of royal blood, but of the latter 
only one of the parents is of royal blood,
their children are called Mom Chaus. The 
title of Royal Highness can be prefixed
to the names of uncles, aunts, brothers,
sisters, sons, and daughters of the Sovereigns
of Siam, but all others, whose fathers were
not Sovereigns of Siam, although they are
called princes and princesses, can only
have the word "Highness" prefixed to 
their names, except where the title is con-
ferred by the Sovereign as a reward for some
special services. Descendants of Princes and
Princesses, Mom Chans, cannot be called
Chau, they have only the title of Mom, as

Amoy Jottings.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our jottings from Amoy are too amus-
ing to be allowed to lie over any longer, so 
we proceed with them at once.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And first regarding the posture assumed
by the Baron de Meritens.  We are un-
der the conviction that however much his
services may be needed by the Chinese
Military authorities, and however effective
they may prove, he is taking a false step
in combining military with custom house
duties.  The French are naturally so zeal-
ous and active minded, so fond of fighting
and intelligent, that they are apt to put
themselves forward and to work them-
selves up in the employ of Oriental poten-
tates. But the system does not answer.
They generally manage to enable the 
power whose cause they may espouse to
fall into their views and to become exces-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}sively pacificious; in this state of mind
Oriental Potentates are very liable to quar-
rel with the British. The Gallic mercen-
ary always sticks to his colors, but as in-
variable, goes to the wall. He compels 
John Bull, it is true, to equip a much 
stronger force than would otherwise have
been necessary, but even so, John makes a
clean sweep when he is about it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What Power in India was there, that gal-
lant French adventurers did not assist to 
repel the British! The native Princes be-
came elated at the result of their Gallic mer-
cenaries' handiwork, and relying on their
powers of resistance, gave the British just
cause of offence and became involved in war
which necessarily ended in their downfall.
But for the intervention of these French
adventurers, India would not now have
been British. Some of the Chiefs whose ter-
ritories we have annexed would have been 
tributary, some would have been subsidis-
ed, and some would have been independ-
ent. The British would never have
dreamed of conquering India but for the
resistance which the Native princes were
enabled to make, through the knowledge
and instruction which they derived from
the French. John Bull was like a horse
—he did not know his own strength until
he was forced to learn it, and then, being
taught the lesson, he took full advantage of
it and never forgot it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We do not seek to enlarge upon this
topic. What we desire to lay down is;
that the enterprise and the pugnacity of
the French render them a dangerous race
in the East where British interests do the
most predominate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Monsieur Giquel for instance at Ningpo
was a very estimable man and a very gal-
lant fellow.  We think we are correct in
stating that he held a civil appointment in
the French service at Ningpo.  He became
excited by war's alarms—he grew exasper-
ated at the apathy of the Mandarins—he 
felt like a war horse in the stable, and
taking the field be rendered the Mandarins
vast service.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Baron de Meritens is a man of more
calibre than Monsieur Giquel, but his im-
pulses are identical.  He receives the pay
of the Imperial Government in one capacity
and his feelings, revolt at seeing the inter-
ests of his employers sacrificed in another
capacity.  He deplores the apathy and the
impracticability of the Mandarins—-he sees
the Mace at the gate, and his seal overrides
its discretion.  He turns Customs cruisers
into vessels of war, and he illegally confis-
cates a foreign steamer that he may avail
himself of her gratuitous services as a cruiser
to the exclusive nomination of the French.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What next? To a military career; to
misunderstanding with the British, and
to the game of India played over again.
There is no controverting the fact. John 
Bull in the east is a most testy fellow—-he
has enormous interests in that quarter—-
and he will never submit to dictation from
the French, who really have next to no real
interests at all with China. True they buy
a little Silk, but they do the business with
British capital through British houses.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Besides, we submit that nothing can save
the Mandarins from destruction except a re-
liance on their own resources for slavation.
So long as they think the an-Kwei will
step in and save them from utter destruction,
so long will they continue apathetic fatalists.
But let them once know that they have to
work their own salvation or to perish, and
we may see an improved state of affairs.
That they are deeply inculcated with the
ideas that foreigners will intercede to save
them, we have no doubt whatever: that this
idea is greatly detrimental to the interests
of the Imperial Government we submit there
is no question. Such being admitted, the
gallant and devoted service of such spirits
as Monsieur Giquel and the Baron de Mer-
itens certainly tend to fortify the detrimen-
tal ideas on the Mandarin mind, and to
encourage that hope which is based on
fatalism and which inducing apathy, and
nurturing imbecility points to destruction.{{< /news/text >}}

THE MOONSHINE TRACT.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The land on this tract is heavily timbered,
with Mahogany, Rosewood, Ebony, San-
dalwood, Nightblooming Cereus, Centnry
Plants, and other varieties, suitable for
building purposes, and the manufacture of
hermetically sealed barrels.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Upon this land, and along the banks of
Cheat River, were found some diamonds of
the first water.  The specimen on exhibi-
tion at the office is a large and splendid
jewel, which far exceeds in lustre the
famous Kohinoor, or any other diamond
since the great Mogul was cut.  The ground
was so rich in precious stones, that the Sur-
veyor who first laid it out, discovered—-ere
he had half completed his survey—-that he
had a large carbuncle on his neck.  {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The most remarkable discovery made
was that of an antique copper coin, with
heads on both sides; also, some loaded
dice, marked cards, and lottery tickets.
These are all convincing proofs that Oil
Companies must have been known in the
remottest ages of antiquity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
THE ANNIAS AND SAPPHIRA TRACT.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This, though a small tract, embracing
only 65,000,000 acres, is worthy of a careful
examination by all who desire to invest in
the stock of the Company.  The first strike
was a large vein of originators of oil
schemes.  Each one had a prospectus con-
taining an accurate description of the pro-
perty, and stating what percentage per
month each Company would pay from its
start.  Here also was fonnd a correct list
the incomes of all persons not connected 
with the Company.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Immediately succeeding was a vein of
Lawyers.  This was an unfortunate strike,
and far from profitable.  They claimed that
as they were part of the land, they had a
fee in it.  Our learned legal adviser con-
tended, on the trial, that they had not
been in possession of the surface, or soil, for
twenty one years, they had no title; and
further, that as the vein immediately under
them was Brimstone, it was evident that
they were more than half-way down, and
should go to the other side.  The Judges in
this case decided in favor of both parties
and advised a compromise.  This was done
in the usual manner.  The attorneys of the
Company took five-ninths, and the other
side took five-ninths, leaving the balance of
the property for the Company.{{< /news/text >}}

THE CHINA OR HADES TRACT,
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The whole of this magnificent tract has
been, since its survey, the wonder of the
world. Every acre is known to be rich in
Tea of the most excellent quality. On the
30th of February last, at 3 A. M., after a
great deal of gas from each of the seven-
teen thousand wells, there was thrown out
per hour, 5,783 chests of Young Hyson,
Souchoong, Gunpowder, Pennyroyal and
Beef Tea, (also, T rail.) Tariff duties paid.
Directions how to imitate tea and coffee, and
an economical method of supplying wash-

Company to state that this is not the tea
thrown overboard in Boston harbor.){{< /news/text >}}

GULLIVER AND RHOROACK TRACT.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This tract embraces 65,000 acres of arable
land, and was laid out by an experienced 
and Competent Patagonian engineer. There
are sixty-three hundred and fifteen wells,
now producing, on each acre, whose average
depth is 49,985 feet, being down to the very
edge of the tertiary formation, and passing
through precious metals—-platina, bismuth,
native gold, corn-starch, fish hooks, verdi-
gris, pewter-mugs, golden syrup, pearlash,
hard boiled eggs and lampblack—-all of
which are being taken out by lateral rail
roads, from the projecting surface of each
vein, and are now sold at highest prices,
thereby yielding an incalculable profit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The flow of Oil from all the wells on this
tract is so enormous, that it was found im-
possible to provide tanks; and, in conse-
quence the Directors have been obliged to
purchase and drain Lake Superior, and use
it as a reservoir.{{< /news/text >}}

Nuisance.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not long since a gentleman on walking
through the Sampeng bazar, saw a corpse
stretched by the side of the walk, having
nothing but a very small peice of mat
thrown over it, leaving the head and legs
exposed to view. How long it had lain
there it is hard to say. Seated near the
corpse were two men begging money to
buy wood to burn it. It was about 9
o'clock A. M. and very hot and the stench
from the corpse was sickening. What it
would be at noon it is hard to say.  It is
said the Police have no power to interfere
in such matters.  It is time however that
some one would interfere and put a stop to
such exhibitions as they are of frequent oc-
currence.  It is an old custom and if it can't
be changed, we think some other place
should be chosen than just by the side of
the thoroughfare, where every person has to
pass along.{{< /news/text >}}

Counterfeiters.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some two weeks ago a Chinaman came
and reported that he knew of a place where
counterfeiting was carried on, and offered
for a certain sum to conduct a police force
to the place.  He conducted them to a
place in the Sampang near Wat Yuan, where
they found a Tachue Chinaman engaged
counterfeiting the common lead cents
or ats used in market.  His mould was
rather an ingenious affair made of chalk.
It consists of a small mould in which is
cut the impression for one of the ats. To
fit in that is a small stamp with the impres-
sion for the other side of the ats. In the
mould there is a small hole for the lead to be
poured in. They found over 350 ats in
his possession probable the work of part
of a day. Two other Chinamen engaged
distributing them were also arrested. The
ots are very much like the genuine except-
ing a small defect on one edge where the
hole is in the mould for the lead to be
poured in.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Fire.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A very destructive fire broke out on the
afternoon of the 11th inst. on the river
bank in the rear of the dock of Chow Paya
Bodin. There was a breeze from the S. W.
which carried the fire rapidly back towards
the new road, and crossing it burning as
far as there was any thing combustible to
burn. It followed the new canal around,
stopping at the bridge near Poh Toh's
building. Mr. Ames arrived with a party
of police, with fire buckets, &c, who were
instrumental in preventing the fire from
reaching a bamboo building adjoining.
Had the flames reached that building, Poh
Toh's buildings would certainly have gone
too. It is said the police deserve great cred-
it for the manner in which they went to
work, and it also shows the necessity of
forming a police station in that quarter.
Had there been such a force there, much
more assistance might have been given and
property saved. About sixty nine houses
in all were burnt. The principle European
sufferers are Messers Dyer & Co. of the
Oriental Hotel, as that establishment and
almost every thing belonging to it, was
destroyed. We learn however that Measure
Dyer & Co. have secured a floating house
and intend to continue business.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}West was also badly burnt, being asleep in a
room and was not rescued until the flames
had already reached where he was, when
taken out he was plunged into the canal.
The fire was the result of carelessness. It
is said that a woman had been cooking
rice and did not extinguish the fire, but
went to the river to bathe, and while bath-
ing the fire caught the house.  Like all
fires it collected a great crowd, many of
whom no doubt 'came for plunder, and
some were detected in plundering goods
which had been saved from the fire, and
they were taken to the police station.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}On the evening of July 1st, a China-
man was attacked in Sampeng, by two or 
more Siamese who undertook to rob him.
The Chinaman roared lustily, and a police-
man immediately ran to his assistance, and
succeeded in capturing one of the gang
whilst running off: upon which another of
the gang gave the policeman, who was
struggling with his prisoner, a severe blow
across the forehead with a hatchet. An-
other policeman arrived in time to secure
the one who struck the blow, but the first
prisoner escaped. He has since been ar-
rested and both have suffered the penalty
of the law. The policeman was not very
dangerously cut and is recovering. He ap-
pears to be unfortunate, having had his nose
cut nearly off, some time since by, some
Germans, whilst he was trying to quell a
disturbance at a house of ill fame.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}A brutal attempt at assassination occur-
red a few days ago. A lad aged about 14
years, was employed on board the pilot
Schooner. He was enticed by some per-
sons to go ashore, and whilst there was
stabbed, the knife barely escaping his heart.
The assassin has escaped, but a man and
woman who were with and lent him the
knife, have been arrested. The cause of the
act has not yet been ascertained.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}We understand that Ah Hoy, alias Sam
the China Captain of the Schooner "Hawk"

by nearly all the Foreign Consular officials
and assistants, with a full representation of
all the Foreign Merchants, and the Roman
Catholic, and Protestant Missionaries. The
number of guests was about forty. The
table was well arranged and tastefully deco-
rated. But it contained an unusual small
variety of viands and fruits, as the market
in Bangkok at the time was very uncom-
monly meagre. What was wanting in eatables,
the wine bibber could gladly say, was more
than made up in drinks, of what quality
we cannot say; but judging from the free
use of them by some they must have tasted
well. We were happy to notice among the
officials and others, some noble advocates
of the transcendent excellency at dinner
parties of the use of Heaven's bright water,
which never makes a man silly or ugly.{{< /news/text >}}

French in Cochin China.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 96)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The employment of a second force, that
of Colonization, has it been energetic? Have
we adopted wise measures? Have we in-
vited capitalists, and laboring men into our
new possessions? Have we opened out com-
merce and industry so as to show our new
subjects the superiority of our power and
civilization. The word colonization ought
to be taken in those days in a different
sense to that of the preceding centuries.
It does not imply those acts of violence and
injustice to which resource was had, to give
quick and profitable returns to the mother
country, from the territories bought or
obtained by conquest in distant parts. No
European nation of our days would use
force even to the most barbarous people to
expel them from the soil they possessed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our enterprise in Cochin China ought to
succeed by economical means, which do not
repudiate the principles of justice and hu-
manity. We ought to offer advantages to
capitalists and laborers, to resort to our
new possessions for their own benefit, and
the interest of France. In this point of
view, we regret that our Government is
more occupied in organising receipts of re-
venue, than in looking to the benefit of the
colony.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our administration ought not to forget,
if they wish to make much of Cochin China,
that they ought to inspire liberal principles,
and to admit in our ports foreign flags free
of duties, and receive laborers and cap-
italists from every country whatever, and
give them lands without national distinct-
tion, viewing in all who come precious
auxiliaries; and denying to no person to
co-operate.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is to the freedom of their ports that
Singapore, and Aden have become in a few
years, the one an entrepot of the commerce
of Indo-China, the other of the Red Sea,
and they have become the central points
from which merchant ships fill these seas.
If adopted at Saigon this system would
produce the same effect. Being at the mouth
of two rivers the Dormay and the Cambodia,
which brings in the produce of the interior,
and fifteen leagues from the sea, it opens
an unlimited field for exportation. Saigon
is called upon as an immense commercial
place, to dispute with Singapore her superm-
acy in the far East. The English, the
American, the Dutch, and the Spaniard
will crowd to it, bringing with them the
activity and ability of their nations, which
will aid us in rendering our new possessions
a market in this central position to the
westward of China, which is to this day
unexplored by Europeans.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The geographical position of France and 
the sedentary habits of her people, do not
allow her to trust to these resources to at-
tain such results, have we not therefore
means? We find in our own organized ad-
ministration, means which are unknown in
many other countries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To carry out this antagonist, it will be 
necessary to form at Saigon a company of
colonists composed of Frenchmen, who 
would use their influence amongst parties
and capitalists to whom we have given free 
access. But we have motives of a different
kind to recommend.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our administration reduced to its own 
resources, are incapable of giving a lively
impulse to the development of the country, 
we are obliged to keep within the bounds
of our resources, which the balance of the 
Budget obliges the Government to measure
with a rigorous parsimony. A company on 
the contrary disposes of a large capital which
it augments by its credit, as useful oper-
ations become necessary, stimulated by its
interests it enlarges its sphere and pushes 
on its efforts, laying the foundation for
future prosperity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Taking for our guide what the English
have done in New Zealand, by forming a
company, and what the Dutch did forty years
ago, by giving a monopoly to a company
called the Matreopy, their successes ought
to be an example for France. The com-
pany thus formed would advance to the
Annamites funds to cover the expense of
cultivation, and to employ more laborers
to open out the immense extent of uncult-
vated lands, they would furnish steam en-
gines for manufacturing sugar. Mills for
making mustard oil, and husking rice.
With those industrial means, the company
would always be able to purchase the pro-
duce at lower rates. Thus there would
always be a permanent purchaser of the
produce of the soil, who would send it to
all parts of the globe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}According to the Annamite system the
forests belongs to the state, and should not 
be left to the mercy of speculators, their 
management should be regular. The forests 
of teak and other timbers should not be left 
unprotected. The company might under-
take this charge under certain fixed con-
ditions. These views have been submitted 
to Government by several projectors, for the
formation of a company, to whom might be
confide? the management of this possession.
Unfortunately for the present there is no
thought of realizing such a programe, the
present absorbing question is of a different
nature, which if resolved upon would have
different results and upset all our dreams.
In closing this essay we ought to state the
sudden changes our policy is undergoing in
Cochin China.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It ought to be remembered that the
treaty of the 5th June 1863 was reluctant-
ly signed by the King of Annam. After
the first answer, which Admiral Bonard
did not consider satisfactory, he was obliged
to send the "Forhin" to Hué, and signify
to the King Tu-duc, that if he seriously
wished for peace, he ought not to delay ask-
ing for it, and also pay down 100,000
ligatures (about 100,000 francs) towards
the expenses of the war, if not, hostilities
should be recommenced with greater vigor.
This manace would not have been sufficient
if he had not at the same time had to put
down the revolt of Tonquin. In spite of
the habitual dissimulation of the Mandarins
who tried to conceal their real sentiments,
all those who accompanied Admiral Bonard
to the Court of Hué for the exchange of
the ratification, returned with the impres-
sion that the Annamites considered the
treaty as ephemeral, as a truce which they
would throw off on the first occasion. The
manner in which Tu-duc insisted upon
sending an ambassador to the Emperor in
France confirmed these suspicions, and from
that time people talked of the possibility of
the Annamite Government obtaining the
restitution of the ceded provinces by pay-
ing the indemnity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A few months after the signature of the
treaty, an Annamite embassy arrived at
Paris. They did not appear in Oriental
pomp, they were modest in manner, and
appeared humiliated rather than proud of
their mission. During their stay in the
capital, they occupied their thoughts and
regarded moveably, our monuments, our
riches, our army and all that was before
the Power of France. Silent and
reserved, it was apparent that they had
other views, then of coming to pay homage
to the Emperor of the French, and to re-
new in the name of their King the engage-
ments of friendship, and peace as recorded
in the Hué treaty. They had confiden-
tial meetings with the Emperor and with
the Foreign Minister. What proposals did
they make? What assurances did they get
in answer to their overtures? We do not
pretend to know, but from that moment it
was noised abroad to the public, that the
Annamite ambassadors had opened negoti-
ations for the restoration of the three prov-
ing in Lower Cochin China which we oc-
cupied. Those that heard it would not
believe such an unlikely act possible. The
Annamite ambassadors returned and the
people were persuaded that if they did as 
above stated it was more to show an honor-
able national feeling before their conquerors 
than with a hope of succeeding.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
For the Bangkok Recorder
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Editor-—One of your most re-
spectable subscribers was heard to say yes-
terday—-"What, have you not got through
with the Fourth of July? I thought that
was all over long ago." He has got full
enough of that subject because he is an
Englishman. But, knowing that he and
all his countrymen would delight to dwell
long on the subject of such a Fourth if
they were placed in the circumstances of
Americans, I will venture to say a little
more about the evening of that day, and
thus obey the "golden rule."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Blake's dwelling, though small, was
made, on that evening, to look like a delight-
ful arcade. The wreaths of green bushes,
variegated with the sweetest flowers were
tastefully formed and arranged. The drap-
ing of the doors and windows, and all
the walls of the outer hall with a variety
of the flags of all nations had the effect
for which it was designed. There was an
unusual proportion of black among the
drapery, which was a suitable emblem of
mourning on' that extraordinary occasion
for the tragical departure of "our great
and good Abraham Lincoln."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I was quite awed while I stood in the
inner-hall before supper, and looked at a
few of the names, of the great cloud of Re-
volutionary worthies, civil, military and
naval, as also at the names of many of our
late and present noble champions, and saw
them battling still more gloriously for the
crushing of that terrible slavacrocy, and
the emancipation of her millions of the
whites and the blacks. Their names were
neatly printed in large letters on white
muslin and hung all around the room. At
one end of the hall I read the ever dear and
venerable name George Washington, and
at the other the no less endearing one
ABRAHAM LINCOLN. This was touchingly
draped in black.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the borders of the white table cloth
were inscribed in large letters with waving
lines, the names of the chief battle fields in
that Greatest of mortal conflicts with human
armor, the world has ever known. At one
end of the table cloth stood Richmond with
the name LINCOLN on the wall by it. At
the end was written Charleston with the
name WASHINGTON corresponding to it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There were two lines of names extending
around the hall. The lower comprised a
choice selection from the great army of
statesmen and warriors of—76. On the up-
per tier, indicating a great advance upward
from the beginning of our nationality, and
the growth of a power able to annihilate the
monster SLAVERY, were the names of Lin-
coln, Scott, Halleck, Grant, Sherman,
Fremont, Foote, Rosecrans, Farragut, But-
ler, Warren, Thomas, Meade, Sheridan,
and many others whose deeds of valor will,
I doubt not, shine in the galaxy of our na-
tional history as long as time shall last.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was quite exhilarating to an American,
and that too without the aid of wine, to
stand at that supper table in the dead of
night as a servant of one of the most bril-
liant parties of European and American
ladies Bangkok had ever before witnessed,
and fancy himself assembled with them a-
mong those battle fields which are destined
to arise Phoenix-like from their present
desolation, being forever freed from the
blight of slavery, and glorying in the Re-
publican armies that had so quickly and
thoroughly emancipated them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There was another view in that inner
hall more touching than any other. It was
the sight of some 30 or more photographs
of American generals and statesmen, arran-
ged in an oval form on one side of the wall.
In the centre of this group was a charming
picture of our late and much lamented
Prest. Lincoln. This was skillfully draped
by itself, whilst the whole group was
artistically wreathed with leaves and flow-
ers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There was a sober mellow tone in all
the festivities of the evening, which may
have been imparted by that and other
manifestations of the saviour of our coun-
try so suddenly taken from us to a higher
sphere of influence and glory. *{{< /news/text >}}
