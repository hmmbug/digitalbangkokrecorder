{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A Madrid letter in the Paris, gives the
subjoined narrative of the execution of
the sergeants implicated in the revolt in
that city:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At noon, two days back, 21 young fel-
lows of the army engaged in the late in-
surrection, almost all of handsome ap-
pearance, were taken out of the prisons,
and, after being tied together two by
two, were placed in carriages with the
windows wide open, and escorted by a
numerous body of troops to the place of
execution. a spot selected in the vacant
ground between the Salamanca Palace
and the Champa Elysees. There was a
preliminary ceremony of military degra-
dation ; a promenade under the flag ;
then a discourse, which I could not hear,
but which lasted two hours, during which
time these unfortunate men must have
already suffered a thousand deaths. An
enormous crowd which had followed the
procession was kept at a distancess by the
troops. At last the 21 victims were
ringed in file, at about a yard's distance
from a low clay wall, with their backs to
the soldiers, and then the discharge took
place. Nearly all of them fell. At that
moment the Hermanaos de la Caridad, or
Brothers of Charity rushed forward to
save at least a few, but were repulsed by
the troops, and the firing recommenced
and continued. The firing went on and
more than 200 shots were fired. What
a sight! I saw one man raise himself
three times and fall again on his knees
with his arms extended in a direction
from which a piercing voice was heard
to shriek in the midst of the mass re-
“Federico! Federico!” The soldiers
then approached the corpses, turned
some of them over with their feet, and
still perceiving some signs of life here
and there, discharged a last shot point
black. All was then over. The bodies
were thrown upon tumbrils, and the re-
giments filed off, some to an air of the
Norma ; some to one of the Semisamide.
Thirty more are to be shot in a day or
two—-soldiers also ; the rest will come af-
ter. Let us hope the queen will show
some compassion.{{< /news/text >}}

Madrid and the provinces. and no appre-
hension exists of fresh disturbances.{{< /news/text >}}

Straits Transfer.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A bill before the House of Commons
provides that the Straits Settlements—
that is to say, the island of Singapore,
Prince of Wales' Island, and Malacca—
shall, at a time to be fixed by Order in
Council, cease to be part of India ; and
Her Majesty in Council may establish
laws and constitute Courts for the gov-
ernment of these Settlements. This
transfer from the Indian to the home
administration is made at the desire of
the merchants in the Settlements. It
will not entail any charge on the finances
of the country—-the Settlements will be
self-supporting. Sir Hercules Robinson
was instructed by the late Duke of New-
castle to report upon the subject of this
change, and the report, which was made
two years ago, recommends that the
three Settlements be incorporated into
one Crown colony, under one governor,
with an executive council, and that for
all legislative purposes there should be
one council, composed, as in Ceylon and
Hongkong, of official and unofficial mem-
bers nominated by the Crown, the Go-
vernor to be enjoined to visit Penang and
Malacca for the certain portion of the
year.{{< /news/text >}}

European War.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}[The following communication is

Continent of Europe, and therefore may

{{< news/centre >}}
BERLIN 9TH JULY 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Great events have taken place since
my last communication. The war has
actually broken out. The Prussian
armies entered the capitals of Saxony,
Hanover and Hessen.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The king of Saxony fled with his
army of 30,000 men to the Austrian
province of Bohemia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The king of Hanover tried with his
army of 20,000 men to reach Austria
or Bohemia, but he was surrounded
by a Prussian army, and after a battle
at Langensalza, which the Hanover-
ians fought with great courage, the
Hanoverians surrendered on the 28th
June to the Prussians, 20,000 men,
cannon, munitions of war etc. etc.
The king of Hanover, generals and
officers were allowed to retire to any
place they liked. The army was dis-
banded and sent home; king, officers
and army swearing not to fight against
Prussia during the war.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Grand Duke of Hessen was
taken prisoner in his capital and sent
to the Prussian Royal castle at Stettin
on the 25th June. He is however al-
lowed to visit quite freely through the
town of Stettin.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Since the last 14 days other great
events have taken place. Prussia enter-
ed with three different armies into
Bohemia, Austria. The 1st army is
commanded by H. R. H. The Crown
Prince; the 2nd army, by Prince
Fredrick Charles, nephew of the king
of Prussia; and the 3d by General
Herwarth v. Bittenfeld.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 27th June the 1st army
gave battle to an Austrian army at
the small town of Nachod in Bohemia;
the Prussians won the battle making
about 8,000 prisoners, 20 cannon etc.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 28th the 2nd army gave
battle to an Austrian army near Mua-
chengratz in Bohemia, the Prussians
were again victorious making 4,000
prisoners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Different other small encounters
took place, a larger one near the Castle
of Seihrow, where the Prussians made
1500 prisoners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 29th another great battle
took place at Gitschin. The Prussian
army was again victorious making
about 6,000 prisoners, driving the
Austrians from this well fortified
place. So that up to the 1st July the
Prussians made 20,000 Austrian pri-
soners. By this victory the Prussian
armies of the Crown Prince and Prince
Fredrick Charles became united in
Bohemia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 1st July H. M. the King of
Prussia left Berlin and arrived at Git-
schin on the 2d July.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 3d July a still greater battle
took place between the whole Prussian
armies and the Austrian armies, the
battle lasted 8 hours; the Prussians
were commanded by H. M. the King;
the Prussians winning again, routing
entirely the Austrian army, making
20,000 prisoners, 120 cannon, and an
immense amount of war material. 3
Austrian Arch-dukes were wounded,
several Austrian generals were made
prisoners. The loss in dead and
wounded is very large on both sides,
but perhaps double on the Austrian
side, on account of the Prussian needle
guns and rayed cannon. It is impos-
sible to describe the result of these
terrific needle guns and rayed cannons,
both Prussian inventions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Austrians fired about once a
minute with their old guns, the Prus-
sians about four or five times, besides
being more accurate and carrying a
greater distance. It is reported from
good authority, that entire Austrian
battalions refused to stand against
these terrific guns and cannon, seeing
that it was useless to fight at a dis-
tance not being able to approach so
that their musketry would have good
effect.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 4th July the Austrian Field
Marshal Benedek sent Gen. Gablenz
to the king of Prussia suing for an
armistice, which was refused.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 8th the Prussians head
quarters were at Pardubitz an import-
ant central point of the Austrian rail-
ways in Bohemia. The Prussian armies
are still advancing; the Austrians
retiring.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The other Prussian armies in Sax-
ony, Hessen etc. had slight engage-
ments with the Bavarian troops with-
out importance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Italians declared war against
the Austrians and Bavarians on the
18th June. They gave battle to the
Austrian armies at Custozza in the
kingdom of Verona on the 24th June,
in which they lost 2,000 prisoners,
and the Austrians 1,200. The Aus-
trians claim the victory, the Italians
deny this, and say that it was only a
great skirmish at best ; but there is no
doubt that the Austrians won the day,
and that the Italians were obliged
partly to retire, but without losing the
battle entirely.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prussia in all her dealings with the
conquered countries of Saxony, Han-
over, Hessen, and part of Bohemia
acts exceedingly friendly and fair to
the populations, not levying any mon-
etary taxes and not taking possession
of any collections of arts, paintings
or valuable curiosities, always declaring
that Prussia wars not with the people
but only with the ill guided Kings and
governments who are under the com-
mand of Austria, and the Catholic
clergy party who wish to crush Pro-
testant Prussia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You cannot imagine how many
false reports are spread all over Eu-
rope by persons whose interest it is to
hide the truth, and so it comes that
many newspapers give altogether false
reports.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The reports I send to you are en-
tirely to be relied upon.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 4th July, after the Emper-
or of Austria heard of the lost battle
of the 3d, a council of all the minis-
ters was held at Vienna till late in the
night, and the desperate state of the
Austrian army in Bohemia was certi-
fied. The Emperor and ministers
have been for a long time aware that
they cannot keep Venetia much longer,
but they were in honor bound to show
fight and to make Europe believe that
they were not afraid of the Italians,
and that if they would cede Venetia
they would do it by their own free
will. A better moment than after
they had won the battle of Custozza
could not be, but they allowed it to
pass ; and rather late the Emperor of
Austria, after hearing of the lost battle
of July 3d, telegraphed to the Emper-
or Napoleon on the 4th or 5th July,
that he, the Emperor of Austria, ceded
to the Emperor Napoleon, part of the
kingdom of Venetia, and requested the
Emperor Napoleon to arrange an
armistice between Austria, Italy and
Prussia.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Up to this date no decision is taken.
The report says, that Italy is not will-
ing to give up the war, without Prus-
sia, as Italy and Prussia after their
treaties cannot single handed make
peace. There is no doubt that des-
patches and telegraphic messages are
hourly exchanged between France and
Austria, and France with Italy and
Prussia, but I do not believe much in
these peace like reports, unless Italy
receives entirely the kingdom of Ven-
etia, and Prussia keeps the supremacy
over Northern Germany.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}DR. SCHWARZ has communicated to the
JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS the
following simple method of preserving
small quantities of ice, which he has
practised with success. Put the ice in a
deep dish or jug, cover it with a plate,
place the vessel on a pillow stuffed with
feathers, and cover the top with another
pillow carefully, by this means excluding
the external air. Feathers are, it is well
known, bad conductors of heat, and in
consequence the ice is preserved from
melting. Dr. Schwarz states that he has
thus preserved six pounds of ice for eight
days. The plan is simple, and within the
reach of every household.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}WHITE USED FOR MOURNING.—-At
Combe, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, the
custom is as follows, when an unmarried
person, under thirty (speaking in the
rough) of either sex, is buried:—-If, as
in the case of a child's funeral, the bear-
ers are young women, they wear white
dresses (commonly nothing better than
petticoats), and white bonnets, with black
cloaks or shawls ; if, as in the case of an
older person's funeral, they are young
men, they are dressed in black, but wear
white gloves and white neck-ties; the
pall is white. At Stonesfield, an adjoin-
ing parish on the north, I found the fol-
lowing additional custom, on recently of-
ficiating there at the funeral of a little
boy. While I read “Man is born of a
woman,” &c., the four girls held the
white pall by its four corners, over the
coffin ; after the coffin had been lowered
into the grave, they held the pall over it
in a similar manner, until the service was
concluded.—-NOTES AND QUERIES.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}How to Produce Eggs.—-“J. H. F.”
writes to the PRAIRIE FARMER; “A hen
is a perfect machine which if cared for as
it should be, being kept in comfortable
quarters and fed with care, will produce
eggs in spite of herself. If as a rule a hen
is kept clean (for nothing enjoys clean-
liness more than a hen) and furnished a
supply of grain, meat and vegetables,
she will produce the eggs which she has
got to lay or die. Take away the flesh
and vegetables and small grain and give
corn and water alone and your hens will
cease to lay and become fat. Corn in it-
self has less of the properties which make
the egg than any of the smaller grains
which we raise. Rice, wheat, barley and
buckwheat are best for eggs.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}BENEFIT OF PLOWING.—-"Farmer
writes to the MAINE FARMER:—-"After
living on a farm for half a century prac-
tising and experimenting, observation and
experience teach me that plowing, in-
stead of being an injury, is a great bene-
fit to any land. My method of treating
waste or pasture land is to first plow it
and sow with grain. The next season I
lay it down, and turn it to pasture for a-
bout four, years, observing to keep
stock on the land night as well as day
for the summer season. Then I plow
again and take off another crop of grain,
after which turn to pasture as before.
My land managed in this way fifteen or
twenty years, is in as high a state of
cultivation as the best manured land I
have."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}HARROWING.—-One of the most im-
portant operations on the farm is the
preparation of the ground for the seed.
Among these is a careful harrowing of
the ground. The cultivator either for
oxen or a hors is a valuable aid on most
soils towards pulverizing the earth. An
extra harrowing is labor never lost. Amid
the hurry of planting we are apt to over-
look the importance of the value of a
fine mellow soil. We never think of
sowing beds in our garden without har-
ing the soil as deep and mellow as pos-
sible. Let Buck and Broad go over the
ground once more, even though the boys
do protest against it. Tell them it will
be all the easier for it.-—MAINE FARMER.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}MR. PEABODY IN NEW ENGLAND.-—Mr.
George Peabody, the eminent American
banker and philanthropist of London,
reached Boston last week in the Scotia,
and has been received with distinguished
marks of honor in his native State, as he
will be in every part of the country that
he may visit. Mr. Peabody was born in
Danvers, Mass., February 18th, 1795.
He started in life poor, as a clerk in a
grocery store in his native town. In 
1814, he became engaged in the whole-

England in 1837, and established himself
as a merchant and banker in London in
1843. His house thenceforth became the
headquarters of Americans in London.
In 1852, he gave to his native town of
Danvers the sum of $80,000 to found a

with a pledge to increase this sum to
$500,000. He also gave $10,000 to the
Grinnell Arctic expedition. His benefac-

Rangoon, Bangkok & Singa-
pore Telegraph Line.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We rejoice in hearing from Singa-
pore of the continued success of the
Telegraph Company concerned in the
projected line from Rangoon to that
place. It appears that their wishes
have been fully granted by the Malay
governments of Jehore, Rambow, and
Selangore. It remains only for the
Company to obtain from the govern-
ment of Perak (a small Malay State
between Selangore on the south and
Quedah on the north—-a tributary
State of Siam) the privilege of cross-
ing her territory with their line, when
the way will have been fully prepar-
ed for commencing its construction.
In consequence of some civil commo-
tions at present existing in that State,
this concession may be delayed a little,
but with no danger that it will be re-
fused.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The English government at home,
we learn, is much pleased with the
project, and expresses lively gratitude
to the Siamese government for its
prompt and noble encouragement of
it. Hence we conclude there is much
reason to hope that the line will be
completed within two years, together
with its contemplated Bangkok
Branch, and its extention also to Ba-
tavia.{{< /news/text >}}

Siamese Ploughs or yokes and
Harrows.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Though a native plough be not
worthy of the name, as remarked in
our last article, we think it worthy of
a description. Their ploughs are of
two kinds, one designed to be drawn
by a single buffalo, and the other by
a yoke of oxen. The difference be-
tween them is mainly in the length
of the beam. The plough for a single
buffalo has a beam only about four
feet long; but the beam for a yoke of
oxen is from 10 to 12 feet in length,
proceeding forward from the handle
with an upward curve, then down-
ward, and the... again upward to a
slender and graceful point which is
seen above the heads of the oxen and
18 or 20 inches a head of them.
This long beam saves the necessity
of having any rope or chain with
which to draw the plough. The
yoke is attached to it by means of a
rope passing through auger holes in
it, and around wooden pins in the
plough beam some 3 feet from its an-
terior end. The end where it curves
above the heads of the oxen serves an
important purpose aside from mere
fancy. Cords passing from the nasal
septum of each ox is made fast to it,
with sufficient tightness to keep the
heads of the cattle quite elevated,
causing them to look peculiarly smart,
and making them, it is said, much
more manageable than without such
an expedient. But for it they could
not, it is thought, be kept in the track
marked out for them, as they loose
all recollection of duty in their hun-
ting for some thing to eat as they
plod along. Such appears not to be
the weakness of the buffalo, and con-
sequently, needing no such martin-
gales to keep his head up, he is hitch-
ed to a plough with a short beam
and draws it by means of rope traces
passing from a rude whippletree to a
wooden yoke fixed on his neck
by a rope in the place of our ox
bow. The yoke is in the form of a
crescent with its extremities curving
a little outward in the form of a small
knob. To these knobs the traces are
tied. You will see the buffalo going
along with great apparent careless-
ness, always holding his head near
the ground, snapping up here and
there a mouthful of grass, and yet
never losing the furrow by which he
is to walk. The only trouble seems
to be, that he will halt a little to get
what he wishes to eat. He, as well
as the oxen, is guided by reins fas-
tened to his nostrils.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A yoke designed for a pair of oxen
is often a simple, straight and round-
ed stick 2¾ inches in diameter and 3¾
feet long. Some of them are more
tasty by having a slight bend down-
ward in their middle with a little
enlargement there for an auger hole for
the rope of the plough or the tongue
of a cart to be attached, a slight curve
upward and then downward for the
necks of the oxen, ending in a little
curve upward. The neck of each ox
is confined to its place by means of
two straight wooden pins three quar-
ters of an inch in diameter and a foot
long, passing through the yoke in the
place of a bow, being less open at
the top than at the bottom, and then
small cords, passing under the neck
tied to the upper ends of the pins,
complete all the purposes of an ox-
bow.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The two kinds of ploughs are a-
bout equally strong, but neither of
them strong enough to stand a hard
pull from a yoke of ordinary western
oxen. The one for a buffalo would
not usually weigh more than 30 lbs.
Its runner and mould board is a na-
tural crotch being one and the same
stick, the shorter branch of the crotch
serving for the mould board, and the
longer branch for the runner. The
latter is about two feet long by 10
inches round. It comes to a small
point at its nose fitted for the socket
of the ploughshare. The latter, but
a little larger than a large human
hand, is made of cast iron the shape
of half of a large ovate leaf cut
square off in the middle. Its upper
plane is flat inclining a very little to
the right hand when in its place. It
bulges out on the under side to form
a flattened socket to receive the
nose of the runner. It is never fas-
tened in its place excepting by a
close fit, their owners wishing to have
them so that they may be knocked
off at night and carried home to
secure them from thieves.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The mould board, if such it can be
called, is only of the same width of
the runner, but made thinner, curving
backward and upward about 12 inch-
es. It has a slight inclination to the
right hand to favor the turning of the
clods to that side rather than the oth-
er. Being a natural branch of the
runner it needs nothing to strengthen
it. The hinder end of the beam cur-
ves down and is framed into the back
end of the runner. The handle of
the plough (for there are never two)
is a natural crook forming a large
segment of a circle four feet long,
passes through the beam just behind
the mould board, and is framed in
the runner near the acute angle made
by the two.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now such is all there is
of a Siamese plough, the wood part
costing only 75 cents, and the iron 15
cents. It cuts a furrow 2 inches deep
and from 5 to 6 inches wide. We
should judge that only about half of
the clods it breaks up are turned
over by it. It does its work very imper-
fectly at the best.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The natives plough in the same
way as we do in America, going
round and round a plat of the lot or
the whole, if it be but small, until
it is all cut up. The teams alway
have rope reins fastened to their nos-
trils, and these the ploughmen take
in their left hand while they hold
the plough with the other.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}This, as before intimated, is sim-

of a rounded stick of tough wood 3
inches in diameter, having 10 or 12
teeth. It has a hoop shape handle
for the convenience of lifting it up to
shake off grass and stubble that get
entangled in its teeth, and for bearing
down to give it more execution
when needed. Its tongue is made of
two small bamboos and extends far
enough ahead to admit of tying to it
the cords from the nostrils of the oxen
and forcing them to hold up their
heads.{{< /news/text >}}

Prof. John Silsby.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have recently received two num-
bers of "The Nationalist " a sheet
36 by 24-inches published at Mo-
bile, Alabama, and edited by Prof.
John Silsby, once our colleague in
the missionary work in this city.
The Nationalist is one of several
newspapers that have sprung up in the
South since the collapse of the great
rebellion, and supported chiefly by
the Freedmen. We are pleased with
the ring of this paper, showing as we
think it does the genuine metal of the
great Republican party, which will
not rest in its onward march of liberty,
until every root as well as branch and
stalk of African slavery shall have
been eradicated from the hearts of
the people as well as from all statute
books in the U. States.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prof. Silsby returned home in 1854
in consequence of his health being
impaired by the climate. From that
time to the beginning of the late civil
war, he was connected with a new
educational institute in Wisconsin.
He and his eldest son enlisted early in
the war. The son having been wound-
ed after two years of service died in a
hospital The father continuing through
the war in the capacity of lieutenant
in the Tennessee Division, has come
out a bold editor in behalf of the mil-
lions of Freedmen, and will we trust do
great good for that chosen people of
God.{{< /news/text >}}

Cheang-Mai State Boats.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As one great object of our paper is
to give reliable information concerning
Siam and its tributary states we pro-
pose in this article to describe the
boats of the king of Cheang-mai, in
which he and his retinue came to the
capital on the 9th inst. We regard a
king who is as yet but little known as
a great curiosity, and the royal barge
in which he rides, and the state boats
which accompany him triennially to
pay tribute to his Suzarain become
consequently curious things. Who
would not highly prize a photographi
pictures of them! Now as we cannot
furnish our readers with such a picture,
we will do the next best thing-—give
a particular description of them with
words.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The whole fleet of 25 boats are es-
sentially of one fashion but of different
sizes. The one in which the king him-
self rode is, we should judge, 70 feet
long, and that more than half of the
train are but little shorter.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A striking characteristic of them all,
is the flaunting stern, curving abrupt-
ly up some 8 or 10 feet, and ending
in the form of a swallow’s tail 20 inches
wide by 2 or 3 thick. Just in front of this,
and nearly as high, is a round roof cov-
ering the main cabin, as we may call
it, about 12 feet long and 8 wide. The
arch of this roof describes nearly the half
of a circle, and is made of bamboo
wattling with palm leaves nicely laid
beneath it to shed the rain. The boat
is only from 2 to 5 feet wide thus near
the stern, and the floor of the cabin
consequently extends over its sides at
the hinder part 3 feet. The cabin of
the royal barge is of course a good deal
more tasty than that of the other boats.
Its walls are of teak-wood paneled, form-
ing a breast work 3 feet high all
around. The space between the top of
this to the beams is occupied by shut-
ters made of bamboo mats neatly paint-
ed, and swinging on hinges above.
Hence the cabin is a very airy room
when all the bamboo shutters are open-
ed. But there is one very serious in-
convenience in this cabin, which is the
long and heavy shaft of the rudder ex-
tending nearly through it, and the
helmsman standing in its midst hold-
ing it. But this inconvenience is ex-
perienced only when the boat is going;
when in port the rudder is taken out
and laid up on shore.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The rudder-shaft of the king’s barge
is 18 feet long and five inches in diam-
eter, and has a paddle-shape blade 6
feet in length by 2 in width. In the
back wall of the cabin, quite to the left
side of the boat is an orifice surroun-
ded with fancy work for the shaft to
pass into the cabin, and on that it
works as its fulcrum. In answer to
the question what can be the necessity
of such a huge rudder for so small a
craft? The native’s reply was, that
the boats could not be steered without
them, especially in passing over the
falls far up at the north.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The midships of the boat is occupied
by a round house 30 feet long, without
any opening excepting small doors at
each end. Its top is 2 feet lower than
the roof of the cabin. Its sides are
made of teak nicely matched and calk-
ed, and the space between the two
is of bamboo wattling like the cover-
ing of the cabin. The width of this
room thus enclosed is about 8 feet. It
is by far the best protected room in
the boat and is, as we suppose, used
for sleeping purposes by the king. The
20 or more feet of the boat in front of
this is open, and there the four or five
rowers sit flat down on its floor with
their faces sternward, and pull their
heavy oars. The bow of the boat ex-
tends out in a flat open plane 5 feet
long and 2½ feet wide, coming to a
point like a dart. This is in fact only
the end of the log of which the bottom
of the boat is made. All these Laos
boats, like the state boats of the Siam-
ese are but immense logs scooped out
to the thickness of two inches or more,
and then the sides sprang out by means
of fire as far as they can be, which is
sometimes 3 times more than their
natural width. The sides are then built
up from 1 to 3 feet with teak plank.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The king's boat is principally dis-
tinguished from all the others by rich
gilding on its stern, describing leaves
and flowers on a black ground work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All the boats have a plank foot path
on both sides, which is more especially
needed when the boatmen are required
to propell the boats by poles against a
strong current in shoal water. They
then walk the planks from stern to stern
pushing with all their might.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have observed that the Siamese
and Chinese, who live far up the Menam,
have boats much like these of the Laos.
There has recently been a great fleet
of them in port all freighted with cot-
ton.{{< /news/text >}}

of Cheang Mai to inquire after her
health, and were happy to learn that
she is reported to be convalescent. Still
she is very feeble and greatly emacia-

which she was seized some weeks be-

Correction.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have not until this late day
learned that we made a mistake
in saying in our issue for July 12th,
that Monsieur Aubaret, Consul for
the French, had the honor of presen-
ting a sword to His Majesty the king
as a present from the Emperor of the
French, and that he probably at the
same time presented Prince Somdetch
Chowfa Chulalongkorn a dagger, be-
ing a gift from the Prince Imperial.
It now appears that neither of these
tokens of honor were sent by him. It
seems that our mistake arose from its
having been incredibly reported that
both the sword and the dagger were
mentioned in the Emperor's auto
graph letter to His Majesty the King
of Siam as having been sent by the
hand of M. Aubaret, and eye witness-
es of the public audience testified
that they saw the sword presented.
This is an apt illustration of the
difficulty we have of get ting correct
information on affairs that occur in
the royal palace.{{< /news/text >}}

Bangkok, Siam as it is.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
From S. U.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}We will take our boat for a morning
side before breakfast. We start on the
broad Menam but only go up the river
a little, and turn into a great canal on
the right hand towards the east, and
this soon leads us to the canal which
surrounds the city without the walls.
We pass on to the rear of the city, leave
our boats and climb a great pagoda yet
uncompleted, but affording from the top
at present a most beautiful panoramic
view of the city and its surroundings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We see the city entire—-the city
proper is now on the eastern side-of
the river. We see the wall around it, a
broad road all around within and the
canal without. Then there are streets
meeting this circular one at right an-
gles. The one through the city runs
along beside the wall which encloses
the palaces of the first and second
kings, (the latter of whom is now no
more,)with their extensive surroundings
for accommodating their extensive ha-
rems, and their equally extensive
crowd of servants; and then again the
homes of the daughters, and sisters,
and aunts, and near relatives of the
reigning king, and of those who have
passed away that once were royal;
for all these are doomed to celibacy,
and must be provided for from the
royal treasury, and have homes and
protection within the palace walls. It
is a complicated household indeed,
that of a king’s in a heathen country
which cherishes polygamy for the kings,
and eternal celibacy for their daughters,
if they cannot find no royal husband.
Then there are the elephant’s houses,
and the royal gardens, and the royal
monasteries many and varied and beau-
tiful towering up before us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We see little of the great river, but
the gardens of fruit trees upon its bank
look like a great forest winding along
amid the vast rice fields, stretching
away on every hand to the edge of the
horizon. The river fronting the city
proper has no gardens. So we see on
the opposite side distinctly-—the forti-
fications made by Falcon and the palace
once occupied by the Siamese kings,
but now by one of the king’s brothers.
Below the palace and inland a little is
a long line of imposing buildings oc-
cupied by the Prime Minister, the Min-
ister of foreign affairs, and their exten-
sive families, and the families of their
father and uncle, two of the most pow-
erful men in the kingdom when the
present monarch ascended the throne.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Their families now steady the reins
of government. They are among the
most wise, politic, and far-seeing in
the kingdom. God grant that they may
henceforward show themselves unsel-
fish, patriotic, and true to the best in-
terests of their country. Should they
suggest liberal policy, the giving to
the people a free choice of worship and
at the same time encouraging good-
ness, learning, and the arts, aiming at a
good government, the day might im-
mediately dawn in Siam and the go-
vernment awake to a new sense of its
powers and its destiny.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The mass of the foreign population
live without the city walls one mile and
a half below on the river, and the new
street parallel with it. The mile and
a half between is occupied by the mar-
ket, the merchant Chinamen, and the
conveniences for trade, and the dwel-
lings of business people. We see also
the king's great lotus garden, the vege-
table gardens, the multiplied rice
mills dotted on the great panorama.
No hills relieve the landscape. It is
the great valley watered by the Menam.
The hills are beyond the ken of vision
except as they may mistily loom up in
the far off horizon. It is a luxurious
prospect, but little varied or striking.
It may be called beautiful but never
bold, or grand, or magnificently pic-
turesque. Yet this scene affords food
for thought. A book might be written
with the recollections of what I have
seen and felt and witnessed in this
place, and among the people now before
me. It is a very suggestive scene.{{< /news/text >}}

to the sun. All these subjects are
sculptured in stone. One may see
painted in gaudy colours and more
fantastic shapes in the Royal Watts at
Bangkok, but in Nakhon Watt are

animated contest is depicted. One

The other seems to be the duel between

procession of his warriors on foot
and horseback, each chief heading
followers on Elephants. I counted
[..] 1000 figures, or at least heads
[...] single department. What gives
[...] interest to this section is the
fact that the artist has represented the
different nationalities in all their dis-
tinctive characteristics in mode and
[...], from the flat nosed savage in
[...] garb of the Prom, and the
[..] haired Los to the straight nosed
[...] with sword and shield, and
[....] Moor with a catalogue of
qualities like another column of
[..] In the predominate physical
formation of each race, on the
whole there is such a prevalence of
specific cast in the features and pro-
portions, as well as the elegant attitudes
of horsemen, that one might sup-
pose Xenocrates of old, after finishing
his labors in Bombay, had made an
excursion to the East. The Chinese
"Min-thanang" compared the
features of the Ceylonese to the
features of a bird, and the Cambodians
are not less surprised at the prominent
peculiarities displayed in these sculp-
tures, which are so decidedly different from the
type in which they themselves for
the most part rejoice.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The department called the three
stages the natives believe they see the
representation of Heaven, Earth and
Hell, but I have reason to doubt this
interpretation. The lower stage it is
represented on one half, the world
of men, and on the other different
animals, but the two upper stages appear
to represent the history of the manner in
which savage tribes were civilised by
colonising foreigners, and must have
reference to the foundation of these
ancient monuments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The far advanced out posts on the
wild mountain forests which are visi-
ble from the windows when walking
through the majestic colonnades,
those who refused the new religion
offered to them, were precipitated into
the hell below; whereas the reborn
converts entered the palaces which
appear on the upper stages immediate-
ly above it. The middle one, not be-
ing continued, particulars of these in-
structive pictures I shall have to defer
till the publication of the drawings
illustrative of them, which were exe-
cuted by a native painter whom I had
taken with me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One subject which frequently occurs
in these sculptures shows the head-
dress of the rude barbarians, being
changed by the king, who adds flowers
and ornaments. Tassals in richly ad-
orned head-dresses called Thepha Kan-
ya or Chao Savan dwellers in Heaven
are sculptured neatly in life size. On
every part of the building forming the
retinue of the deified kings they cor-
respond to the Wedadari of Javanese
Mythology, but they are designated by
the Cambodians of to-day in grateful
remembrance of benefits received as
the benevolent or kind hearted Ladies.
The varieties of the head-dress are
manifold, but that which occurs most
frequently towers up in three high
points. The name Ketsmales the
father of king Pathu-massury-wong,
one of the race of the sun-born lotus,
means, when translated the head ad-
orned with garlands,are mostly Champa
flowers. There are a great many in-
scriptions scattered all over the build-
ings at Nakhon Watt, some of them
are modern, written with Cambodian
letters and in the language now spoken
by the people. Their purport is to
describe the offerings made, and give
the name of the worshipper. The
other inscriptions are written in a
character, which likewise for the most
part resembles the Bali, and therefore
the Cambodian letters, but in a more
antiquated form approaching that of
the Kawi inscriptions, and sometimes
deviating considerable. The language
differs from the vernacular Cambodian
as well as from the Bali, and is not
understood now. When the ruins
were discovered in 1570 the inscrip-
tions were already, as De Maneando
remarks, unintelligible to the Cambo-
dians.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With the help of some priests in
Udung, I have however succeeded in
deciphering some names, and I am
still busy with them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The modern inscriptions every lit-
terate Cambodian can read.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In one of the galleries a square ta-
blet of black marble has been set into
the wall, bearing an inscription which
my guide told me contained the his-
tory of the building. I had it copied
and as it was written in the common
Cambodian, interspersed with some
obsolete expressions, I had it read to
me and translated, but found it only
to contain a long discription of offer-
ings made by different donors, inter-
spersed with some interesting allusions
to mythological objects. The date was
1628 probably of the Maha sakkarrat.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The central of the five towers of
the inner circle in the temple of Na-
khon Watt forms an octagon, with
four larger and four smaller sides. On
each of the four larger sides, opening
out in gates which face the four hori-
zontal points, stands a large figure of
Buddha overlooking from its high
position the surrounding country. This
open exposure of the statues is the
very counterpart to their concealment
in the vaulted cells of Pagan, where
the statue in the Ananda temple is to
be illuminated by artificial light and
in the rock cut Basilicas of the Dek-
kan.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This combination of four Buddhas
occurs frequently in Cambodia, and
is there called Phra Muk Buen, (Phra
si na) in Siamese,-—or the Lord with
four faces—although not only the faces
but the whole bodies are four-fold,
and Chatua Baya four shouldered
would be more appropriate. If sculp-
tured on the Watt three faces only
can become visible, but if standing
free a fourth face is added to the
Trimurti. A four faced deity is
worked out in gigantic proportion on
the large gate on Nakhon Luang, and
is there called Phrahun or Brahma,
signifying the protection given by the
all seeing god, which was afterwards
transferred by the Buddhists to the
four Pala. As this direction to the
four points of the horison naturally
forms a crossing, the Siamese call a
crossing (Phrahun) and the Praat
Prassada. The distinguishing feature
of these exotic stone monuments of
Cambodia forms always a cross with
the corridors dissecting each other at
right angles. The cross is the de-
stinctive character for the Doctors of
reason in the present Buddhism of
Kasyapa.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The corridors are two-fold with
blocks of stone projecting over each
other so as to form an arch. Narrower
arches are formed by the hollow of
the covering stone resting on two
stones in the form of a wedge. The
blocks of stone are fitted together
without cement but leave scarcely a
trace of there joinings, and the same
is to be observed of some contempo-
raneous brick buildings which are
found at other places intermixed with
other stone ruins.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The edifice of Nakhon Watt was,
as their name City of monasteries,
signifies, built for the reception of the
learned patriarch Buddhagosa, who
brought the holy books of the Trai
Pedok from Langka, Ceylon. The
residence of the kings at that time was
the far famed Inthapataburi, which
is now in its ruins called Nakon Luang
—-Royal city, by the Siamese, or Na-
khon Tom—large city, according to
the Cambodians, both languages hav-
ing adopted the Bali word Nakhara.
Its foundation is referred to a prince
of Roumah or Ruma, but the story is
too long to insert here.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Connected with the temple of Na-
khon Watt is the establishment of a
number of villages inhabited by a
people called Samre, on the neighbor-
ing Khao (mountain) Lechi. When-
ever some work is to be done on the
temple, the abbot sends a message to
the mountains (1½ day distant) and
the required number of laborers has
to be sent by the head man.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The nomination of the abbots, who
were placed there after the re-discovery
of the temple in the year 1570, is now
in the hands of the Governor of Siem-
rab. The custom to endow a temple
with slaves was prevalent on the whole
continent. There were pagoda slaves
connected with Schewery-dragon in
Rangoon, and there are still slaves be-
longing to several pagodas in Birma
proper. In the latter country they
were however supplied by prisoners
of war, Arracanese, Kassay, Peguans
&c. &c. whereas the Samre belongs to
the aboriginal stock of the population
inhabiting most of the hills around
the lake and thence to Kampot.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Leaving the platform of the temple,
which is fortified by broad moats and
a stone wall, a two hours ride through
the forest brings us to the ruins of
Inthapataburi, the ancient capital of
Cambodia, now known under the name
of Nakhon Luang, or Nakhon Tom.
The ruins are there extensive, and from
them were taken the stones which
furnished the material to build the
fort of Siemrab.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The outer most of the three walls
encloses a wide arch, which according
to the natives, it would take a whole
day from sunrise to sunset to circum-
ambulate. The second wall was the
fortification of the city proper, and
then followed the celestial wall, the
adamantine one Kampeng Keoh, which
contained the palace and the royal
buildings now to be traced in these
ruins. This system of three fortifica-
tions, one within another, is a standing
one in Ultra India, but has recently
been repeated by the Burmese in
building their new capital.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One enters the Watt of Nakhon
Tom, which is built with square blocks
of iron conglomerated through a mas-
sive structure forming the gate, the
upper part of which is worked at the
four sides into a face of Phrahm.
The Chinese traveler of 1295 mentions
a five faced Buddha of stone placed
above the gates of the Cambodian
capital. The space inside the Watt
is mostly overgrown with jungle, but
here and there are some spots cleared
for the planting of rice, or a bamboo
hut is perched on heaps of rubbish
under which the stone and brick
buildings of the old capital are buried.
Large images of Buddha of modern
make are put on some old foundations;
but in that dedicated to the protecting
Deity of the Town we find an ancient
figure of the Elephant headed Ganese.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In Siam every town has a larger or
smaller chapel for the honor and the
preservation of the Lak Muang—-the
Town pillar, an injury to which would
bring destruction on the citizens. The
tree is still pointed out at Nakhon
Tom under which the leader of the
emigration buried the golden umbrella
—the emblem of Royalty, and by this
artifice got possession of the country
which had before been occupied by
the Dayms.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The palace was situated on an em-
inence, and a stair case which leads up
to what remains of the second story.
The corridors are in the same style as
those in Nakhon Watt, but lower and
of a more rude workmanship, wanting
the high finish and elegance which
distinguishes every part of the former.
The figures also of men and animals
which are sculptured on some of the
walls, show a more primitive style of
execution, bolder but less graceful and
probably older than those in Nakhon
Watt. One of the finest specimens
still possessed of these bye gone times
is the statue of the last King Phya
Khi Ruen or Phra bat Songkaya, who
reigned in Nakhon Luang, and was
afflicted with leprosy for having desert-
ed the snake worship of his ancestors.
A great number of stone inscriptions
in the ancient character called Akson
Mihing, are found at Nakhon Luang
on the pillars and on the walls.{{< /news/text >}}

Trichinae.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Professors in the Academy of
Sciences, Chicago, Ill., have recommend-
ed the following means of defense against
the ravages of the trichinae.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now that the existence of trichinae in
our pork has been established beyond a
doubt, it will be proper for us to point
out all known means of defence against
its ravages. First, with regard to the
rearing of hogs. These animals undoub-
tedly become infested through the eating
of flesh of some kind, since no trichinae,
nor germs of trichinae, have ever been
found in any vegetable food. A strict
attention to the feeding of hogs, and
their confinement in pens where no animal
food is accessible, is an infallible preven-
tive against trichinosis in them. Such
management is all the more necessary,
since European authorities agree that it
is impossible to diagnose the disease in
the animal from external appearances,
and no culpability can therefore attach to
the farmer for selling hogs which prove
to be affected with trichinae.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In regard to pork the origin of which
is doubtful, the use of the microscope is
primarily indicated. With this instrum-
ent only can we ascertain with certainty
whether the muscles of the hogs are free
from the parasite. The general use of
the instrument is, however, impracticable,
unless a system of microscopic inspection
be adopted here, as in Europe, at the
great packing establishments. But we
have in our power much more simple
means of insuring safety in the consump-
tion of pork. It is simply necessary to
cook it thoroughly, so that every portion
of the meat shall have experienced a
temperature of at least 160 degrees
Fahrenheit. We cannot insist too strong-
ly upon this point. Again, by properly
salting and smoking the meat for a
period of at least ten days, the trichinae,
should they exist, will be certainly killed.
Simple desiccation of the meat, if con-
tinued for a period of sufficient length,
will also kill them. They will never be
found alive in old hams, for instance.
On the other hand, mere pickling appears
to have very little effect upon these
worms.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Trichinae have doubtless always existed
in the muscles of the hog, although pro-
bably not to the same extent as at present.
And trichinosis in man may have existed
to a considerable extent in this country
before its nature and cause became
known. Some of the members of your
committee can recall cases of obscure
disease which have come to their know-
ledge in past years, which may have been
owing to the presence of trichinae.-—New

{{< news/text >}}A friend called on Michael Angelo,
who was finishing a statue. Some time
afterwards he called again: the sculptor
was still at work. His friend, looking at
the figure, exclaimed, "Have you been
idle since I saw you last?" "By no
means," replied the sculptor; "I have
retouched and polished that; I have sof-
tened this feature and brought out this
muselo; I have given more expression to
this limb." "Well, well," said his friend,
"all these are trifles." "It may be so,

{{< news/text >}}A WONDERFUL TREE.—In the birch
wood of Culloden, Scotland, there is a re-
markable tree, well worthy of note. About
thirty years ago, a young giant of the forest
was blown down, and fell across a deep
gully or ravine, which it completely span-
ned, and the top branches took root on the
other side. From the parent stem no less
than fifteen trees grew up perpendicularly,
all in a row; and there they still flourish,
in all their splendor, while the parent stem
evinced no token of decay. Several of the
trees are not less than thirty feet high.

Ancient Egyptian Fashions.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Egyptians shaved their heads and
chins, and looked with abhorrence on the
rough-haired and long-bearded Asiatic
nations. They only allowed their hair
and beard to grow when in mourning, and
looked upon it, in any other circumstan-
ce, as a sign of low and slovenly habits.
Most of them wore over their shaven polls
wigs made of curled hair, with a series
of plaits at the back. Poor people, who
could not afford the expense of real hair,
had theirs made of black sheep's wool.
By a singular contradiction, the great
people wore artificial beards, which they
likewise affixed to the images of their
gods. The beard of an individual of rank
was short and square, but much longer;
and that of a god was pointed, and turn-
ed up at the end. Ladies wore their hair
long, and worked into a multitude of
small plaits, part of which hung down
their back, and the remainder descended
on each side of the face, covering the
ears completely. They generally had an
ornamented fillet round the head, with a
bud in front by way of a FERBONIRE.
Some of the CREME DE LA CREME indulg-
ed in a head-dress representing a peacock,
whose gorgeous plumage set off their dark
tresses; and princesses were usually dis-
tinguished by a COIFFURE of extraordinary
dimensions, combining all the riches of

sian Court fruit is preserved by being
packed in creosotized lime. The lime is
slacked in water in which a little creo-
sote has been dissolved, and is allowed to
fall to powder. The bottom of a plain
deal box is covered with it one inch thick,
and over it is a sheet of paper. Upon
this the fruit, well selected and cleansed,
is arranged; over this another sheet of
paper, and on the top of this another
stratum of prepared lime; in the corners
a little finely powdered charcoal is put.
The whole box is then filled in the same
manner, and the well-fitting lid nailed
down. Fruit kept in this manner will re-
main intact at least one year.—PRESBY-

"Fine Writing."
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As the loveliest women are not gaudy
women, so the most excellent writing is
not "fine writing." A thought that is
overdressed must be of the highest worth
not to be criticised as meretricious. Splen-
dor of diction must have the big brain of
a Burke or a Milton back of it to render
it admissible. The great masters of style,
however, as Homer, Demosthenes, Dante,
Shakspeare, are splendid by virtue of their
magnificent naked thoughts. Their words
are thunder because their thoughts are
lightning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But there is a vast brood of writers
now-a-days that "spread themselves" on
language. They are nothing if not mag-
niloquent. Rainbows, birds-of-paradise,
and peacocks' tails are their staple colors,
which they lavish over all creation. They
gather up the four winds of heaven and
blow everything sky-high. They pile the
agony upon all they behold. They des-
cribe a dog-fight in language stately
enough to depict the Battle of the Py-
ramids.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Headly is of this high-pressure style
and Abbott, and George Lippard. Sou-
thern writers are nearly all keyed up to
this intensely strained and pop-eyed pitch.
Indeed, these latter are always eating fire
and splitting ribbons of chain lightning
and blue blazes. Every one of them
stands, as it were, constantly with "one
foot on the Andes and the other on the
Ganges," and howls his awful eloquence
to the nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Youth is very much addicted to this
"fine writing." It is natural. Spring for
flowers. But it is not the fruit-blooms
that flower all summer. The style which
would yield intellectual food must cast
the painted metal and betake itself to the
green leaf.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You must quit "fine writing" early if
your ambition is to produce anything ac-
ceptable to refined taste. Strip your
thoughts as naked as ever they were born,
if you wish them to fight well in the world.
Go as direct to your theme as a streak of
lightning. Ride right down upon it like
a charging cavalryman. Fill your words
up with thought, so that they shall weigh
seventeen or eighteen pounds a piece.
Weigh each word and see that it comes
up to that standard before you say it.
Nobody wants your words. Your thoughts
—-your own-—everybody is interested in.
What do you think? Say—-and quit your
froth and fustain. We desire no more
"fine writing." John S. C. Abbott, for
instance, has furnished enough to last to
the end of the world.—-XENIA TORCH-

The Nile.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. R. DUNN, correspondent of the Lon-
don MORNING STAR, in a letter from Suez,
under date of February 21, thus speaks
of that most wonderful river in the world
-—the Nile:—“The great NATURAL pe-
culiarity of Egypt, and that which not
only distinguishes it from all other coun-
tries, but is the cause of all its other pe-
culiarities, is the wonderful Nile. The
immense quantity of water necessary to
cause the continued rise of a river with a
good strong channel, ordinarily from a
half to one and a half miles wide, is
widened to from five to fifty miles in
width, is astonishing, and almost sufficient
still to stimulate the belief that some
divine agency, rather than the rains of
Abyssinia, must be the cause. And this
appears still more strange, when it is re-
membered that not a single spring or
branch of any kind enters it within a
thousand miles of its mouth. It is strange
indeed, that in so hot a climate and so
vast an extent, the volume of water is
not diminished by absorption and evpora-
tion; and perhaps the fact that the wat-
ers seem to extend through the entire
valley upon the same level with the Nile,
can alone explain this continued fulness.
The sands from the deserts, which bound
this valley upon either side, seem to be
constantly crowding in upon the fertile
soil, while the deposits of the river, which
have raised its bed and banks about fif-
teen feet within three thousand six hund-
red years, are crowding in upon the de-
serts, and thus, as elsewhere in nature.
antagonism maintains the equilibrium."{{< /news/text >}}

Rev. Edwin Sidney has recently received
a letter from Dr. Livingstone. It ap-
pears that he has taken with him a num-
ber of tame Indian buffaloes, to introduce
into Africa; and as, like the African ones,
they do not suffer much from that terrible
pest the Tzetze, it is hoped they may be
acclimatized. Hitherto there have been
no beasts of burden as such in Central
Africa. The intrepid explorer and mis-

Christians, and willing to work, and the
Doctor has great hopes that they will
prove valuable pioneers and coadjutors.

to remarry, when the mutiny broke out.
Mr. Beadon has pledged himself to intro-
