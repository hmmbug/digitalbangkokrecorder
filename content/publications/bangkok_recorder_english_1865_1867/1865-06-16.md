Bangkok June 16th.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The news from the United States of A-
merica by last mail to those of us who are
citizens of that country is full both of joy
and sorrow. The surrender of the two prin-
ciple armies of the rebellion to the Federal
commander, must be a source of joy to
the whole civilised world whatever differ-
ences of opinion may have hitherto existed.
But it is appalling to think that such a
struggle which had already cost so much
blood should end in such a tragedy. Noth-
ing could be more lamentable than that the
South after having laid down their arms
should be avenged by the hand of an assassin.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That the death of ABRAM LINCOLN at
such a time as this is a calamity to the
whole civilized world we presume there are
few who will attempt—to deny.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The storm which burst upon the United
States in the spring of 1861, had been gath-
ering for thirty years. Again and again did
the Southern leaders break out, and threat-
en to dissolve the Union, and as often was
the matter hushed up again by “pouring
oil upon the troubled waters” and making
new concessions to the slaveholders. A
point however was eventually reached be-
yond which the North could not go. The
fugitive slave law which was one of the con-
cessions made, had become a dead letter, as
the great majority of the people in the
Northern States could not conscientiously
whole civilized world we presume there are
ed the slaveholders very much.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The refusal to admit the taking of slave
property into any of the free states or ter-
ritories, was also very irritating to the
South. When however a strong opposition
arose in the North to the extention of slave
territory, the wrath of the South was be-
yond bounds.—In 1856 the Republican
party was formed, which adopted as the prin-
cipal plank of its platform the leaving of
slavery in the states where it already ex-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}isted, to those states themselves, but to op-
pose the extention of slave territory. This
the South declared was not a national par-.
ty, nd should such a party be successful
they would immediately secede. The par-
ty with J. C. Fremont at its head was de-
feated in 1856. Mr. Buchanan. was elected,
and although a Northern man was a strong
Southern sympathizer. He chose his cabinet
officers chiefly from the South. During
the whole of his administration they were
preparing for secession. They robbed the
treasury, and sent all the arms and muni-
tions of war South.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}During this time, however, Providence
was raising up one who should guide the
nation through. the pending struggle. The
Republican party in 1860 nominated A-
bram Lincoln as their Candidate. Why he
was nominated, we suppose no one can tell.
He was at the time comparatively unknown
to the nation. He had raised himself by
force of character to a respectable position
as a lawyer in Illinois and eventually to con-
gress. But when the Republican conven-
tion at Chicago in 1860 could not agree
on any of its prominent candidates, and
began to look around for one not so exten-
sively known, why they chose Mr. Lincoln
rather than a hundred others we can't tell,
unless they were governed by an overruling
Providence, Mr. Lincoln was elected. The
storm broke upon the country. Lincoln
soon proved himself to be no ordinary man.
The manner in which he took hold of the
reins of government and conducted the
country through that fearful contest, is
familiar to all who read the news of the
day. He was the choice of the majority of
the people, and when the flag of the nation
was insulted, that people rushed to the as-
sistance of their Chief Magistrate. Every
thing that a free people could do to sustain
his hands was done. Still he had not only
a powerful enemy to contend against, but he
had also a very strong opposition party in
the North, which was throwing every ob-
stacle possible in his way. He had also
the opposition of the principle powers of
Europe to contend against. At the out
break of the rebellion scarcely a power in
Europe believed the North would ever be
able to subdue it. The whole tone of the
press, and the influence of the principle
men of England, and France, with a few
honorable exceptions, was to that effect.
Not the least daunted by all this, President
Lincoln remained firm in his purpose to
preserve the Union. With that object he
started out, and he firmly adhered to it.
True he sometimes, in cases of military,
necessity, resorted to expedients, which
were declared by his enemies to be not in
accordance with his avowed object, but
still he retrected nothing. No President ever
relied more upon his own judgment and
resources than did Mr. Lincoln.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Wholly a self made man, and never hav-
ing had the advantages of a finished educa-
tion, still his state papers are acknowledged
to be models of style and power. In his
social qualities, although the butt of ridicule
for courtly Journals, and often betrayed too
clearly that he had not been brought up in
the atmosphere of the court, still he possess-
ed high conversational powers, an original-
ity of thought, and richness of joke, which
any courtier might have envied.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He was no less renowned for his honesty.
Actuated by no ambitious motives he start-
ed out with one object in view, and of that
object he never lost sight. The preservation
of the Federal Union was his highest am-
bition and the people felt the country was
safe in his hands. “Honest Abe. Lincoln”
will be the watchword of future generations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He also displayed great ability in steer-
ing the country clear of foreign difficulties.
The strong sympathy displayed for the re-
bels among certain classes in England, and
the supplying them with arms and muni-
tions of war and vessels to prey upon the
commerce of the United States, was cal-
culated to irritate the loyal people of those
States. There was a strong pressure from
certain influential quarters to demand from
England reparation for property destroyed
by the Alabama, and other privateers, and
to push that demand even to war if neces-
sary. Mr. Lincoln's course however was
such that no one could take exceptions to it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The magnanimity which he in the end
displayed towards his own enemies, and the
enemies of the country, of itself proves
him a great man. The rebels had tried to
destroy the country, they had heaped upon
him also the vilest abuse, they starved, and
murdered in cold blood the Union prisoners
but still, when they yielded, he manifested
no disposition for revenge, no desire to vent
a personal spite, but was willing to bury
the past, and offer the right hand of fellow-
ship to all who were willing to return.
The crowning act of his life however, or
that which will perpetuate his name to pos-
terity more than any thing else, was his
emancipation proclamation, freeing millions
of the human race who were held in bond-
age.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That President Lincoln should be per-
mitted to fall by the hand of wickedness
just at this time, when the rebellion was
subdued, is one of those dark Providences
which we cannot penetrate. His work
doubtless was done. Taken away however
at this time, he will live forever in the hearts
of the American people. Had he been
permitted to live longer, he might possibly
have committed some blunder which could
have tarnished his fair name. Had James
Buchanan been called away before he oc-
cupied the Presidential chair, he might
have been lamented in his death by a grate-
ful people. But he disgraced the Presi-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}dential chair by his weakness and Southern
sympathy, and will go down to his grave
unlamented by his countrymen. Presi-
dent Lincoln was undoubtedly a firm be-
liever in the doctrines of Christianity, and
had a high respect for the services of the
sanctuary. It is to be hoped therefore that
amidst all his other duties he did not whol-
ly forget his duty to his Great Creator and
Redeemer.{{< /news/text >}}

TUILERIES-During the
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Revolution of 1789.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Palace of Versailles since its com-
pletion in 1702, had been the usual re-
sidence of the French Monarch. Here
Louis XIV spent the last years of his long
reign, and Louis XV the whole of his.
For the first fifteen years, also, after Louis
XVI came to the throne, the Court con-
tinued to be held at Versailles. But on
the memorable 5th of Oct. 1789, that ill-
fated Monarch and his Queen left this sumpt-
uous abode never to return. On their
arrival at Paris in the evening, in the hands
of the mob, they were conducted first to
the Hotel de Ville and thence to the
Tuileries. This Palace was their ordinary
dwelling, and eventually it may be said
their prison, till the deposition of the King
on the 10th Aug. 1792, when he and his
family was removed to a more secure
place of confinement. The removal of
Louis XVI from Versailles to Paris was
followed in a few days by that of the
National Assembly. The first sitting which
this body held in the national capital wasAssembly,
on the 19th Oct. 1789, when they met in
one of the Halls of the Archiepiscopal
palace in the Ile de la Cite. Here they
remained till the 9th Nov. when they re-
moved to an apartment, which had been
prepared for them, in the Manege, a riding
house attached to the Tuileries. The Hall
in which the assembly met is said to have
been both inconvenient and mean. *{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The convention which followed also met
in this apartment on the 21st of Sept. 1792,
but removed in April next to the splendid
hall in the Palace formerly called the Salle
des Machines, and now forming the Salle
des Spectacles, or Theatre. On the closing of
the convention and the establishment of
the constitution of the year III, in Oct.
1795, this Hall was appropriated to the
council of the Ancients, and the council
of the Five Hundred met in the Manege,
which was repaired for their use. The
two legislative bodies continued to occupy
the same place of meeting till they were
transferred to St. Cloud by Bonaparte in
Nov. 1799. †
The 28th of Feb. is known in the annals
of the revolution by the name of la journee
des poignards, the day of the poniards. On
the morning of that day the mob, (let the
reader imagine the bravest Irish rabble to
be ever witnessed, and then he will hardly
realize the grovelling characteristics of a
French mob,) had assembled in consider-
able strength in the Faubourg St. Antoine,
with the intention of proceeding to Vin-
cennes and demolishing the palace there,
and massacring every one who should offer
the least opposition to their unnatural fury.
These rioters were headed by Santerre
the Commandant of the Faubourg. They
had actually carried their purposes into
execution to some extent, when Gen.
Lafayette arrived at the head of a detach-
ment of the national guards, and without
much difficulty dispersed them, taking
fifty or sixty of their prisoners. On his
return to Paris, however, Lafayette encount-
ered considerable opposition from the
rabble, and so much personal outrage that
he narrowly escaped with his life. His
aid-de-camp who was mistaken for him
was fired at more than once as he passed
through the wood of Vincennes. In the
course of the evening the rumour of these
events spread over the capital. It was
said that Gen. Lafayette was killed, and
that the royal residence was on the point
of being demolished. Alarmed by these
reports, about nine or ten o'clock that
night, a considerable body of the noblesse
and other persons of monarchical prin-
ciples, amounting it has been said, to
about five or six hundred persons, present-
ed themselves at the Tuileries and ob-
tained admission by means of orders
obtained from the Duke de Villiquier and
the gentlemen of the bed chamber. They
were armed with swords, pistols, hunting
knives and daggers. They came they said
to defend the person of the king in which
they believed to be in imminent danger.
Whatever Louis might have thought of
the motives which inspired this offer, he
felt its extreme imprudence, and than placed
as he was, it was impossible to avail
himself of it. The Parisian guard, to
whom the defence of the palace properly
belonged, exclaimed against their introduc-
tion, and the king in reply to their profes-
sious of loyalty, and zeal for his safety,
desired them to surrender their arms and
retire, adding " I am in perfect security
amidst the national guard." At last La-
fayette himself who had been reported
killed, made his appearance. Perceiving
at once the disastrous consequences which
were likely to result from their rash enter-
prise, he could not refrain from insisting in
warm language that they should immedi-
ately deliver up their arms. They however
attempted to resist his demand, but were
without much difficulty overpowered, and
at last laid down their arms, as ordered, on
the tables which stood in the anti-chamber
of the royal apartment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These miscellaneous weapons were at
once seized by the national guard as trophies
of their victory, and their late possessors
were then subjected to the additional hu-
miliation of being made to pass forth from
the palace between two rows of those
troops, who, with as little generosity as
could be expected from the jealousy, which
the known character and political senti-
ments of the intruders were so well calculated
to excite, not only insulted the hapless
cavaliers with hooting and all manner of
derision, but added still more violent acts
of outrage and injury on the most distin-
guished members of the noblesse among
hemt.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is understood that the result of the jour-
nee des poignards, and the conviction im-
pressed on the King's mind, led to the re-
newal in a more urgent manner on the part
of the royal family, of overtures, which had
already been made sometime before, to the
celebrated Mirabeau, to secure the aid of
his great talents for the monarchical party.
The negotiation had been completed, the
orator gained over, the price of his deep
treachery settled, part of it paid, and the
plan which he was to commence oper-
ations in his new character arranged, when
he was suddenly attacked on the 28th of
March with an illness which proved fatal on
the fifth day after. He died on the 2nd
April 1789. Here let us give a passing
glance at the real character of this remark-
able French patriot.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Honore Gabriel Riquetti Count de Mira-
beau, was born at Aix in the year 1749,
and was one of the Marquis de Mirabeau,
author of the “Ami des hommes” and one
of the chiefs of the sect of the Economists.
This apostle of public liberty was the tyrant
of his family, and his harshness was one of
the principal causes of the irregularities
and vices of his son, whose youth was agi-
tated by the most violent passions.‡ Return-
ing to his country, after having served
some time in Corsica, he at the age of
twenty five undertook to carry off a young
lady of interesting appearance, from the
person to whom she was promised in mar-
riage. Being little scrupulous about the
means of accomplishing his object, he made
use of calumny, and in a little time she who
was the subject of it, had no other way to
save her reputation but to marry the man
who had tarnished it. It was impossible
that this union could be happy. The mis-
conduct and dissipated life of Mirabeau
caused his father to take the most vigorous
measures against him, and even to cause him
to be banished. In consequence of a pri-
vate quarrel he was shut up in the castle
of Jouix in Franche Comte.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Making an ill use of some relaxation of
his captivity, he committed another flagrant
crime and fled to Holland. He was con-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}demned to death for this crime—and being
arrested by surprise in 1777 he was again
imprisoned in the dungeons of Vincennes.
While in prison he devoted himself with
all the vehemence of his character to study.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Being set at liberty in 1780 he published
two years afterwards his works on "Lettres
de Cachet" and "State Prisons." Not long
after this he was employed by the ministry
on a secret mission to Prussia. He there
witnessed the last moments of the Great
Frederick, and the beginning of the reign of
his successor, whose character and weak-
ness he unveiled in his "Secret History of
the Court of Berlin," a libel which appeared
in 1789.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rejected by the nobility of Provence on
the election of the deputies to the States
General in 1789, like another Clodius he
renounced the rights to which his birth en-
titled him, and got himself elected by
"Tiers etat" of the city of Aix. He pro-
moted the reunion of the three orders and
declared himself openly in insurrection,
almost in the King's presence in the sitting
of the 23rd of June, by replying to the grand
master of the ceremonies, who brought to
the assembly the order for them to separate,
"Go and tell those who sent you that we
will not quit our places until compelled by
their bayonets," "No body," says the Mar-
quis de Ferrieres speaking of the sudden
extinction of this brightest luminary of the
assembly, "dared to seize the sceptre which
bad dropped from the grasp of Mirabeau". La-
trape and other writers have drawn the
character of this famous orator, whom, if
we please, we may call a great man; but
woe to the country and age that may pro-
duce a number of great men like him.{{< /news/text >}}

American Generals.

(Continued from page 94.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}After two years further, service Captain 
Grant resigned his commission in the army,
and removed to St. Louis Missouri to try 
his fortune at civil life. He secured a small 
farm in the neighborhood of Mr. Dent's 
his father-in-law, and commenced farming. 
He has frequently been seen during the 
winter season seated upon his wagon, with 
felt hat, blouse, coat, and pants tucked in- 
side of his boots, driving his load of wood 
to town for sale. He afterwards engaged 
in business in St. Louis under the firm of 
Boggs and Grant, but it appears the firm 
for some reason or other was not eminently 
successful. In 1839 a proposal was made 
to Captain Grant by his venerable father, 
to go into the leather business with him 
in the west. His tannery education now 
served him to a good purpose. He ac- 
cordingly removed to the city of Galena, 
on the banks of La Fevre river, in Jo Da- 
vies County Illinois. There he commenced
business under the firm of Grant and Son.
Their business prospered. The quiet unob-
trusive manners of Captain Grant, attracted
customers throughout the great state, and
soon the firm became extensively known.
Here Captain Grant was quietly attending
to his business when the rebellion broke
out. It is said that one morning upon
reaching his office, he received the morning
papers and after reading the account of the
bombardment of Fort Sumter, he walked
behind the desk, drew on his coat, and said,
"Uncle Same educated me for the army,
and although I have served through one
war I feel that I am still a little in debt for
my education, and I am willing to dis-
charge the obligation. I am for the war to
put down this wicked rebellion."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He immediately went out and consulted
with some of the leading men of the place,
and the result was that they soon raised a
company, which Captain Grant took to
Springfield and offered to the Governor.
A gentleman called on the Governor and
recommended Capt. Grant as a suitable
person for a military position. There was
however no rush at the time for military
positions, and Governor Yates had already
had many applications from men in fine
clothes, of commanding appearance,
and large muscular forms, and it is said
that he carefully eyed the little man in home
spun, before him, and after due consider-
ation concluded that he had no appoint-
ment for him, so Capt. Grant left. Govern-
or Yates however being no military man
himself, was soon perplexed and distressed
in raising the quota of troops for the state.
He had many applications for military
positions, but a very great majority of them
knew nothing of military organizations.
In his embarrassment Governor Yates ap-
plied to the gentleman already alluded to,
and asked him if he could render him any
assistance. The gentleman replied by pre-
senting before him again Capt. Grant, the
plain little man in homespun. "Do you
understand the organisation of troops?" ask-
ed the Governor. Grant replied in the af-
firmative. "Will you accept a desk in my
office for that purpose?" asked the Gover-
nor, "Any thing to serve my country" was
the reply. He accordingly soon proved to
the Governor that he knew how to raise
and manage men. The mustering depart-
ment however did not satisfy his military
spirit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In two weeks after he entered the de-
partment Gov. Yates began to realize his
worth, and told his that he was requested
by the President to propose the names of
two persons from the state, for Brigadier
Generals, and desired that his should be
one of them, but his honor Grant deemed
it prudent to positively decline, on the
ground that he was a "stranger" and that
he did not seek promotion. After finishing
his duties in the mustering department he
went to visit his parents who now resided
in Kentucky, and whilst there he received
a commission from Governor Yates making
him Colonel of the Twenty First Regiment
of Illinois Volunteers. After the term of
the three months men had expired his re-
giment reinlisted and he retained the com-
mand. A little circumstance soon occur-
red which illustrates his character as a
commander.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Applications were made to Governor Yates
to send a regiment of men to Quincy, a
town one hundred and twenty miles dist-
ant. He had plenty of regiment but no means
of transportation. Grant told him to send
his regiment, and he would find means of
transportation. The command was given
and before night the regiment was marching
on foot to Quincy. The first active service
given the Twenty First Regiment was in
the district of North Missouri in the de-
partment of Gen. Pope. Several regiments
were ordered on the same service and it
became necessary to have an acting Briga-
der General, and although Grant was the
youngest Colonel in the lot he was pro-
moted to a Brigadier General. He was
still however by no means a showy Briga-
dier, and was recognized chiefly by a
rather bad looking "stove pipe" hat he
was accustomed to wear, before he could
be persuaded to doff it for the cap, and
yellow lace. His first command was small
having his head quarters at Cairo Tennes-
see. He soon managed to gain several vic-
tories which although small were neverthe-
less important. When Gen. Fremont was
superseded by Gen. Halleck Gen. Grant's
command was considerably enlarged. Hal-
leck saw in him the making of an excellent
commander, and entrusted to him the com-
mand first in importance in his own de-
partment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first important movement in Grant's
new command was commenced in conjunc-
tion with the gun boats up the Cumberland
and Tennessee Rivers against Forts Henry
and Donelson. He had an army of nine-
teen regiments of infantry, and six of cav-
alry and seven batteries of artillery. These
were divided into three columns under
Generals Paine, McClernand and C. F.
Smith. Fort Henry is on the east side
of the Tennessee, and the still more for-
midable Donelson is on the west side
of the Cumberland. Com. Foote was in
command of a fleet of seven gun boats,
four of which were iron clad, Henry was
the first place of attack In consequence
of bad roads, and some miscalculations of
distance, the troops did not reach the fort
as soon as the gun boats and the energetic
Foote attacked the fort and compelled its
surrender before they arrived. Next came
Donelson. Two days march, and two nights
sleep upon the cold ground, brought Grant's
troops to some of the action. The gun
boats made the attack but the current be-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ing very strong and some of them be-
coming disabled they dropped down the riv-
er. It was now Grant's turn, but whilst
he was maturing his plans the rebels hurled
a large body of troops upon his right. It
was a bloody contest, and that night the
troops slept upon their arms. The next
morning the rebels again made a terrible
onslaught. The lines swayed to and fro and
those of the Union forces were well nigh
broken, when timely reinforcements ar-
rived. Another disaster also occurred. A
regiment of Union forces coming on the
field mistook their friends for rebels, and
fired upon them and they in consequence
fled to the river. Gen. Pillow of the rebels
hasty telegraphed to Nashville. "On the
honor of a soldier the day is ours." Grant
however still thought otherwise. He sat at
his head quarters as cooly as if nothing
were going on. Messenger after messen-
ger brings him the reports of his officers.
He scans them over and looking up to one
of the staff officers exclaims. "We have them
now." Smith and Wallace are ordered im-
mediately to take the rifle pits at the north
west corner of the Fort. This was done
and an approach made for the batteries to
shell it. The sun set that day upon a gory
scene. Again they slept upon their arms.
The next morning however a white flag
floats over the Fort. The rebel Generals
Floyd and Pillow had' escaped witha few
troops in the night, in a small steamer, and
Gen. Buckner who was left in charge saw
that he could not hold out successfully de-
cided to surrender. He accordingly sent
Grant the following note.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Head Quarters, Fort Donelson,
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/right >}}
February 18th 1863.
{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gen. U. S. Grant, U. S. A.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir—In consideration of all the circum-
stances governing the present situation of
affairs at this station, I propose to the com-
manding officer of the Federal forces the
appointment of commissioners, to agree
upon terms of capitulation of the forces and
Fort under my command, and in that view
suggest an armistice till 12 o'clock to-day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
I am Sir respectfully
Your Obedient Servant,
S. B. Buckner Brig. Gen. C. S. A.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gen. Grant's reply to the above note
was the first thing that brought him into
general notice:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Head Quarters, Army in the Field,
Camp near Donelson, Feb.16th 1862.
Gen. S. B. Beckner, C. S. A.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir—Yours of this date proposing an
armistice, and the appointment of commis-
sioners to settle terms of capitulation is just
received. No terms other than immediate
and unconditional surrender can be accept-
ed. I propose to move immediately upon
your works.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/right >}}
U. S. Grant, Brig. Gen. U. S. A.
{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}From these circumstances, and the first
two initials of his name he received the
sobriquet of Unconditional Surrender
Grant. Gen. Buckner could do nothing
else than surrender unconditionally. Gen.
Grant took at Donelson 13,000 prisoners,
3000 horses, 48 field pieces, 20,000 stand
of arms and a large quantity of stores.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}For the taking of Donelson Grant was
promoted to the rank of Major General in
the regular army. His rising reputation
however soon began to excite jealousy. A
committee waited upon Gen. Halleck be-
fore the news of the taking of Donelson
had reached St. Louis, requesting Grants
removal. The principal cause urged for
his removal was that he indulged in the
use of intoxicating liquors. Gen. Halleck
however whatever else he lacked, did not
fail to see in Grant, a great soldier, and his
answer to the committee was : "I am satis-
fied with Gen. Grant and I think you soon
will be." The deputation were still stop-
ping at the Hotel in St. Louis when the
news of the capture of Donelson and 13-
000 prisoners arrived. Gen. Halleck posted
the news upon the Hotel bulletin with his
own hands, and when all crowded around
to read, he remarked in the hearing of the
same deputation, "If Gen. Grant is such a
drunkard as reported and can win such vic-
tories as this, I think it my duty to issue
an order that every man found sober to-
night in St. Louis shall be punished with
fine and imprisonment." This remark was
aimed at the committee who evidently
were not so much afraid of intemperance,
as of Gen. Grant's rising reputation. No
greater libel upon Gen. Grants character
could have been manufactured, for he does
not indulge in intoxicating liquors of any
kind. One who has fought long under him
and has the following testimony: "I know
that he is one of the most moderate of all
men in his desires. His purity is equal to
his modesty. His personal character to my
certain knowledge is without a blot."{{< /news/text >}}

AMERICA
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
From Home News.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first act of the American War has
closed with a tremendous finale. For three
days together the great Confederate General
maintained himself in fierce and even doubt-
full battle against the combined forces of his
adversaries; but at last he succumbed to
numbers, and resigned to the enemy the
strongholds which he has defended so long.
Richmond and Petersburg are in the hands
of the North, and though Lee, even in these
desperate straits, has retired in good order
with the remnants of his army, it is impos-
sible to anticipate that his resistance can be
effectually prolonged. The South retained
but one great army, and that has now been
half destroyed. The loss of Richmond
might in itself have been, perhaps, sustain-
ed, but, coupled with the defeat of Lee, it
represents a veritable catastrophe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The event has been unicipated not only
in America, but in this country for some
time past, and yet it did not occur in con-
formity with the prevalent speculations.
Farragut had no part in it, nor Sherman
either. There was no flotilla, no bombard-
ment, no combined attack by land and water.
It is due to General Grant that his military
abilities should be recognised and his suc-
cess acknowledged. It was his army in the
end which captured Richmond. He did
"fight it out on that line," as he had pledged
himself to do, not only all through the
summer, but through the winter, and through
the following spring. Often and often was
he repulsed with dreadful losses, but he
clung with unconquerable tenacity to his
work, and never once relaxed the grip which
he had obtained. He forced his adversary
into Richmond, and sat down before its
ramparts with the resolution, which he has
well maintained, that sooner or later the
city should be his. It is true that he had
the assistance of Sheridan, and that without
that co-operation the final assault would
probably not have been attempted. The
hardest of the fighting, indeed, fell to
Sheridan's share, and he seems to have
displayed much of that genius which won
him so remarkable a victory in the Shen-
andoah Valley. But the whole work, sub-
stantially, was the work of Grant, and it
was the work for which he had waited in
patience and confidence through nearly
twelve months of discouragement. He was
the first General of the North who refused
to recognise defeat, and the reward of for-
titude is his at last.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After paying, however, this tribute to
the conqueror, we are bound to give due
honors to the vanquished, and the task will
not be difficult. General Lee has forleited
none of the renown which gives him so dis-
tinguished a place in the eyes of the world.
All that a consummate commander could
do under extreme difficulties he has valiant-
ly done. He did not decamp from his
position, nor try to cut his way out; still
less did he resign, as was prognosticated,
all hope of resistance. He waited in his
lines, reoeived the great assault with ex-
iraordinary intrepidity, and fought to the
last. Then he withdrew deliberately from
the field, evacuating his strongholds and
carrying off what remained of his army. If
we may accept as unexaggerated the esti-
mate of his losses, he can have but a slender
force left. A reckonin of 25,000 prisoners
and 15,000 killed and wounded will acoount
for the greater part of what was but a
moderate army to begin with. The South-
ern General is retiring, it was supposed,
upon Lynchburg, but s Federal force has
recently been advancing on that town from
the west, and the road may be no longer
open to the Confederates, For months
passed, indeed, the Northern forces have
been closing grimly round the single army
of the South, and it is to the combination
of foes that Lea at length has yielded. He
had upon him at once the Grand Army of
the Potomac under Grant, the Army of the
Shenandoah Valley under Sheridan, and
the Army of Tennessee under Sherman.
They shut him in on every side. Though
Sherman was not present at the last en-
gagement, he was at so short a distance and
was so formidably posted that Lee was com-
pelled to detach troops to keep him in check.
Then upon his weakened forces fell Grant
and Sheridan together, the former with his
old stubborn strategy, the latter with his
impetuous and brilliant valour. The Federals
had troops enough to fight and watch to-
gether, to engage the Confederates at every
point, and to take advantage of the slightest
opportunity, Suddenly, after three days'
fighting, Richmond and Petersburg were
discovered to be empty, and the Northern
Generals seized their prize.{{< /news/text >}}

Robbery.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Thursday the 8th inst., about 7
o'clock a. m. N. A. de Fonseca a Portuguese,
(who for a long time and till quite recently
was Interpreter to H.R.H. Krom Hluang
Wongsa Tirat Sanit.) went to the palace
of H. R. H. and when H. R. H. was yet
asleep stole a Chronometer gold watch, a
long gold chain, a box containing the like-
ness of H. R. Highnesses mother, and a
box containing a compass. There were
many witnesses of these several thefts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}H. R. H. Krom-Hluang, being informed
of the robbery, requested Mawm Rachot'ei,
the International Judge, to give due inform-
ation of the same to Mr. Moor the Portu-
guese Consul, who despatched an officer to
the floating house of Fonseca, where he
found many things belonging to H. R. H.
which Fonseca had stolen some time before.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the slaves of Fonseca testified that
Fonseca had stolen a box containing money
belonging to H. R. H. that in the act of
taking it, he wrapped it up with red cloth
like that used for bunting, and gave it to
him to carry to Fonseca's floating house,
early one morning when H. R. H. was a-
sleep this was done many months ago.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In that box there were several purses of
silver and gold. One was full and contained
ten cattics of silver, another a white purse,
contained more than five cattics, another
was made of green silk and contained gold
earrings, and money more than three cat-
tics, and another was wrought with gold
thread and contained gold weighing 55
ticals.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Fonseca must have stolen property from
H. R. H. before this to a large amount,
He never was engaged in any regular bu-
sines but was a great gambler, staking of-
tentimes 100, and even 200 ticals at once.
He gambled with Chinese brass cubes, and
cards. He has from time to time bought
slaves for his own service until they have
become very many, and he has purchased
gardens, orchards and rice fields; also cows
and buffaloes to a large amount.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Portuguese Consul appears to have
taked the part of Fonseca, and has not de-
cided that those articles of stolen property
shall be restored to H. R. H. He has only
decided that Fonseca is guilty of having
stolen the Chronometer from H. R. H. be-
cause there was many witnesses to corro-
borate the fact, and has ordered that Fon-
seca make full restitution for the Chrono-
meter, be imprisoned in Bangkok for six
months, and then banished to Macao.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now there is yet much property in the
possession of Fonseca, which his wives are
daily pawning in the market, and he is in-
debted to many persons. Since the Por-
tuguese Consul has adjudicated the case in
this manner, refusing to seize the goods and
chattels of Fonseca and cause them to be
sold at public auction, and using the avails
thereof to make restitution for the property
stolen from H. R. H. and for the payment
of his several Creditors according to Por-
tuguese law in Europe, he seems not to be
righteous.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Wednesday the 7th inst, witnessos
having testified to the stealing of the Chro-
nometer, Fonseca confessed that he had
indeed stolen it, but that seeing he was
likely to be detected, he threw it into the
river on the 2nd inst. But there is another
person who testifies that he saw the watch
in the possession of Fonseca on the 3rd
inst. This the Portuguese Consul refuses
to investigate.{{< /news/text >}}

Tour to the Hot Springs
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 98)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was a strange act to break the chain
of my journal, as I did, in the middle of
that extraordinary breakfast in the wilder-
ness. But it was the best that I could do
in the circumstances, because I had spun
out my details to such an extent that no
more of my yarn could be crammed into
the nut-sheets allowed me at the time. And
now, since I have some inkling that prolixity
is a weakness, I shall try to guard against
it a little by saying nothing more of the
after part of that breakfast, though I think
my pen could easily make a little volume
of quite readable matter from the incidents
that occurred to my observation during
that half hour.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Breakfast being over, we each spread out
his blanket or mat over the dry leaves of
the place in the densest shade we could
find, and endeavored to make up for the
loss of sleep we had sustained the last night,
and to mollify somewhat the chafing and
bruising we had had by sitting in an unac-
customed saddle six successive hours before
breakfast. With but one exception, each
found it next to impossible to sleep; in an at-
mosphere so close among myriads of black
and red ants, which have their homes under
every dry leaf of the forest, and were to be seen
animating every green one we had in our
arbor. This exception, though a delicate
merchant, seemed to have been originally
designed for the rough and tumble life of
a boundary line surveyor, or a soldier, for
he could sleep while the ants were using his
person as a bridge, and the sun streaming
upon him in great power, and never seemed
to mind it. One of the party complained of
a cracking headache, which he judged to be
premonitory of an approaching fever.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Soon after breakfast our ox carts were
ordered off to the next station, a Karen vil-
lage. One of the men conveyed a letter
from the Governor of Petchaburee to its
Karen chief, requiring him to receive us
with all due attention and hospitality. Our
party were to remain until 3 o'clock P. M.
and then resume our journey in the cool
of the day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The woods in which we stopped consist-
ed largely of the trees called ton yang and
mai-ta-baak. The former is quite remark-
able for its lofty bearing and uprightness. It
is the tree from which the natives obtain a
brownish pitch or oil in great use among
them, in connection with the resin, (which
I have previously noticed), for making their
boats impervious to water. The mode
of obtaining the oil is to cut a large notch
in the tree three or four feet from the
ground at a certain season, and then to burn
the wound until the upper superficies of it
become quite black. The lower part is cut
into a concave form to make a basin for
holding the dripping oil. From one to two
quarts may be caught in every such basin
every twenty four hours. Without the
charring the oil will not flow. All the ton
yangs in that region seemed to have been
brought into such service to man, evidenced
by the old and new notches we saw in
them. It appeared not to be the proper oil
season at that time, as but little of the article
was to be seen in any of the basins.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The texture of the wood of the oil tree
is rather soft, and but little used, except-
ing for the main pillars of the funeral pal-
aces for kings and other extraordinary per-
sonages. These are required to be perfectly
straight and about 150 ft. high. This
timber is sometimes used for flooring when
the planks made of it can be protected from
the weather.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Mei ta-baak, in its prime, is also a
splendid tree, and remarkable for its green-
ish-white and smooth bark, and for the
great effort every tree makes to spread
out its base into a half a dozen or more dis-
tinct pillars. Its texture is quite close, and
planes very smoothly, but it will not bear
exposure to rain and sun. It is almost as
much a favorite timber for the white ants
to riddle as fir and pine. Planks of it are
in common use by the natives for flooring
purposes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Finding myself ill at ease at our resting
place, I walked out a little way at noon,
following a cart road, or I heard the charm-
ing music of chopping trees in the forest
in that direction. Presently I found six
Laos men, each having in charge a yoke of
oxen and a cart. They were on a journey
of a day and a night in pursuit of a certain
long grass for thatching their houses, and
had stopped to rest and feed their teams
until the sun should decline a little to the
west, when it becomes cooler. The men
were quite busy,—some in repairing their
vehicles—some in cutting and splitting bam-
boos for making baskets and various other 
utensils,—and some in cutting and splitting 
green rattans into strings for tying the 
thatching material on their roofs. {{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Their stoutest oxen were only the seize 
of an ordinary European yearling steer, and 
worth as they informed we from thirty to 
sixty Ticals a pair. Their carts indicated 
pretty fair handy-work of a cart-wright, 
but were of the old patriarchal model, most
awkward in shape, and most prodigal in
their demands of muscular strength to haul
them about. A usual load for a single yoke
of oxen, the Laos told me, is about three
piculs, which is nearly equal to 400 lbs.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having by such conversation introduced
myself to the good graces of those Loatians,
I then introduced the far more important
subject of religion. They expressed them-
selves very strongly as being poor and op-
pressed by heavy taxation, and hence as
longing to find some future rest. I pointed
them to the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
as being a sure and straight way to com-
plete and everlasting rest.—that He and
His and our common Almighty Father are
still living and will live forever the un-
changable God—that this God is the maker
and preserver and proprietor of the universe,
and that we all live and have our being in
Him alone. They caught hold with ap-
parent eagerness of the idea that the almighty
and eternal Father is a Spirit, and exclaimed
—O that is just what we hold, and hence
when we fall into any great trouble we look
up to Him and make offerings to propitiate
His favor. This testimony substantiates
what the missionaries have often learned of
this tribe of Laotians, and is an apparently
encouraging feature in them as subjects for
evangelization. But it should ever be borne
in mind, that they are no nearer gospel con-
vertion, by this phase of religious views,
than are the wildest American Indians, or
the most bigoted Mahomedans, or the most
legal Hebrews.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At 4 p.m. we mounted our ponies again,
and set off for the Karen village called Ta-
p'long. It was a ride of about ten miles in
a dense forest of primitive trees nearly all
the way, the timber being much like that
already discribed. Occasionally we saw a
grand specimen of the sacred tree called
ton poh improperly denominated the ban-
yan tree. Its leaf is like the wild poplar of
Am. The Siamese regard it with much
veneration because tradition says that
Buddh sat under its shade "once on a time"
and shed upon it the beams of his glory.
We saw one of them holding in its firm
embrace a lofty salow tree. A singu-
lar peculiarity of the sacred poh is to throw
its numerous arms all around some other
tree, as a false religion does its influence
around its votaries, which it never relaxes
till the death of its subject. The way it
does this, is to deposit its gummy seeds, by
the agency of birds, in some angle of a limb
or some crevice or crack in the bark, or on a
little deposite of earth which the ants have
made on some convenient lodging place, and
then the seed, being the most tenacious
in the germinating principle of all seeds,
is sure, to sprout and shoot down its roots
in all direction around the trunk of the
tree, taking care that every one of them shall
cleave fast to the bark wherever it goes, un-
til it reaches the ground. While seeking
their mother earth, they spread out and
expand until the most of them unite and
form apparently one entire envelope, with
only here and there an opening through
which you may see the trunk of the tree
which it has invested. It is the most
common thing to see palmyra trees of
Petchaburee held in such embrace. We
saw a few small trees of teak. The proper
home, however, of this timber is far up
the Menam Chow Phya and its tributaries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We reached Taplong about 6 p.m. Our
ox carts had arrived in good time, and the
chief of the place had been duly informed
by the Governor of P. that he should re-
ceive us with all the attentions we might
need. Having no house or shed in which
he could accomodate us, he prepared for
us a most comfortable lodging place under
an arbor made by the natural tops of sever-
al thrifty pomelo trees meeting together.
There he spread a large bamboo mat 15
by 10 feet for a carpet, and in the middle
of this he set a table, consisting of a plank
8 feet by 2, a little elevated from the carpet
by blocks. Each weary, dusty, thirsty,
hungry traveler of us hailed this place of
rest as if it had been the best hotel he had
ever seen, and each chose his berth in it with
all eagerness and gladness. One of our
number, who had had a fever nearly all
day, with strong pains in the head and loins,
exclaimed as he laid himself down on his
blanket, having an extemporized straw pil-
low for his weary head, "I never in all my
life was so glad to get to a resting place."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having rested a little, we were politely
conducted by the chief to a bathing pool
supplied by a spring of cool water in the
same place. O how refreshing was the
bath we each took! Never could the most
refined bath in an European hotel have
been more so. Our host had no trouble
in providing for our table, for all that we
needed, and a good deal more had been
brought along in our carts; and our stew-
ard had made it all ready. The kindness
of the missionary ladies at P. in their
provision of pies and cakes was then, as at
our breakfast, quite conspicuous and was
gratefully reciprocated. Though we had
no chairs to sit in at our table, we did not
feel the need of any, as a seat flat down on
our carpet was, under the circumstances,
a great luxury excluding all desire for any
other of the kind.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We all partook of our dinner with a
keen relish save the one sick of a fever.
The physician very providentially with us
(like all other events of life) prescribed
for him rigid fasting after his cold bath,
and a heavy dose of the bitter quinine, and
this to be repeated in four hours; so he re-
tired at once into his own corner, and fell
into a sound sleep.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}While eating, it was remarked by one
of the party, that not less than four classes
of European society were represented by
our little company,—vis. Rulers in the
person of one consul of two nations.—the
Clergy in two missionaries—Physicians in
one person and the half of another, and
Merchants, in two of the number. Surely
there was dignity in our professions enough
to have stamped that Karen cottage in the
wilderness with everlasting importance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now, for the second time, I am
forced to snap assunder my long and
splendid thread. O what a pity!  *{{< /news/text >}}

THE FRENCH IN MEXICO.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The situation of the French in Mexico
has been fully canvassed in the French
Corps Législatif, and the course taken by
the government has been strongly condemn-
ed by the Opposition as being likely to
embroil the country in a war with America.
The answer of the ministers has the merit of
being distinguished by this utmost candour.
They did not attempt to blink the question,
but declared that the honour of the French
flag was concerned, and that they were
determined to support the Emperor Max-
imilian, cost what it might. This, at least,
was plain speaking; but it should be added
that the French government entertains the
strongest confidence in the financial regen-
eration of Mexico, and believes that the
cost of their friendship will be amply repaid
by and by. As to a war with America,
M. Rouher has no apprehensions of any
such issue; he thinks, in the first instance,
that the Americans have no inclination
to quarrel with France, and in the second,
that they have no desire to interfere in the
affairs of Mexico. On these points he may
be wrong or right; but in any case he has
shown consummate judgment by adopt-
ing a conciliatory tone towards the North,
in the same breath with the announcement
of the determination of France to maintain
the empire of Maximilian. America can-
not complain hereafter of having been
misled or deceived. France is resolved to
fight for Mexico, if fighting be necessary,
and has already testifled the sincerity of
her support by pledging her own credit for
a Mexican loan.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is not surprising, under these circum-
stances, that the belief in the likelihood of
a war between France and America should
be revived, and acquire increased currency.
This time it comes associated with a ru-
mour, important if true, but which is as
yet unsupported by authority. It is said
that, in anticipation of a hostile movement
on the part of the Northern States of Ameri-
ca, France has proposed to England to enter
into an engagement of joint action and
mutual support, in the event of an aggre-
sion on Mexico or Canada.{{< /news/text >}}

A Romantic Courtship and Mar-
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}riage.—The Sunderland Times prints the
following:—Some time ago the mate of a
Sunderland vessel, while at a Chinese port,
fell ill of fever and subsequently died. An
Englishman and his wife, living in the land
of " barbarians," were kind to the dying
man, and in his last moments strove by their
attention to ease, as far as they could, his
passage from this troublesome world. The
kindness shown to the suffering seaman
came to the knowledge of his widow in
Sunderland, and she, in a letter to the Eng-
lishman and his wife, thanked them for
what they had done, and begged they
would, in return, send her their cartes as
a remembrance of the debt she owed them.
After the lapse of some months, she receiv-
ed an answer from the Celestial Empire,
from the Englishman, in which he convey-
ed the melancholy intelligence that, shortly
after the departure of the vessel to which
the mate belonged, he had the misfortune
to lose his wife, who now lay interred by
the side of his friend, the husband of the
woman to whom he was writing. Acting
upon the high encomiums he had heard of
the character and qualities of his fair cor-
respondent, he judged she was a suitable
person to fill the place of his deceased part-
ner, and at once "popped the question,"
giving as a reason for his promptness that
so long a time was required for the trans-
mission of a letter and its answer, it would
be half a year before he knew what her
reply would be. Enclosed was his portrait,
and he begged a return of the favor. The
letter, as may be imagined, was a surprise
to the widow; but after weighing all the
circumstances, she consented to be 'wooed.'
The courtship thus strangely commenced,
continued to progress until a few weeks
ago, when the happy man who was to be
the bridegroom arrived in England, was
not long in finding his way to Sunderland.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}and the 'banns' were at once proclaimed in
Bishopwearmouth Church.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Siamese Twins are again be-
fore the public attention. They have con-
tinued unmolested on their plantation in
North Carolina during the rebellion, being
ineligible to the draft. They dress in the
Confederate grey, and attend as members
Baptist church. Domestic troubles have
overtaken them; in consequence of the
jealousy of their wives,-not, as was custom-
ary at the South, because of conjugal
infidelity, but because of the excess of
children with which one was favored. The
old question remains unsettled, and grows
grimmer as the brothers advance in years—
they are now over fifty—Will both die
together, or can one exist without the oth-
er, and the connecting bond be out? They
fear secession when it comes home to their
own persons. Much more have they
reason to fear a situation like that of
North and South before the war-—a living
body bound to a corpse.{{< /news/text >}}

by his teacher, not long since, what the phylacteries
of the Pharisees were-—"Broad hems, such as ladies
wear on their dresses," was the reply. "But the
Pharisees didn't wear them for the same reason
that ladies do, did they?" "O yes," was the wicked
answer, "to be seen of men."{{< /news/text >}}
