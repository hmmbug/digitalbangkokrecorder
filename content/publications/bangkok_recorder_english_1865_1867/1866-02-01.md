Piracy.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Report of the British bark
"Bentinck."
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Bentinck, James Thomas, mas-
ter, put back having been surprised
by pirates, in Chino bay, on the morn-
ing of Saturday 9th December, with
loss of two men, portion of the cargo,
master's and crew's effects, ships stores,
furniture, &c. On the morning of
Monday 4th, sailed from Hongkong
bound to Ningpo, with a general car-
go, and crew consisting of 14 men.
All went well, and on Friday evening
the 8th instant, being in with Chino
Bay, and blowing a fresh increas-
ing gale from E to N. I considered it
would be advantageous, to the progress
of the passage to anchor in Chino
Bay, till 3 or 4 o'clock the following
morning. accordingly came to in 6
fathoms. At 5.15 P. M., set the regu-
lar watch, with orders to call all hands
if any suspicious craft were appro-
aching the ship. At 2.15 A. M. (Sa-
turday.) the second mate called all
hands, saying there was a junk appa-
rently coming alongside. We all got
on deck almost immediately, but in a
moment the junk sheered up on the
port quarter, heaving stink pots and
firing pistol shots on board as she
ranged alongside, I saw some of the
men run to the fire arms a few of
which were on the deck but as some
of the pirates were by that time on
board, I ordered them (my crew) not
to fire a shot, but to get down below
immediately as I considered it then
the only chance for their lives. We
then all made below. the deck being
by that time covered with pirates, I
called to those nearest me to get in
the lazarette, and one man and myself
got down. By this time the pistol shots
were firing down the cabin, and the
pirates had possession of the ship. They
then began to call out for the Captain.
The Chief mate came in the Lazarette
at this time, and immediately after
him what appeared to be the leader of
the Gang. He called to me to come up,
but I levelled a revolver at him, at
the sight of which he jumped up quick-
ly himself. A second man shortly after
came below the scuttle, but he went
up rather quicker than the first. I did
not fire at either of those men, as the
mate and man that were with us, and
myself, were certain that if I did, it
would be a signal for the murder of
all the crew. I finally agreed to come
up unarmed and at their mercy, the
mate to pass the pistol to the Chinese
afterwards. I considered throughout
the entire affair, that my death was
certain, but I now believe through
my sparing their leader, the crew that
I now have on board and myself were
spared our lives.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On their getting hold of me, the
apparent leader ordered me to show
him where the opium and 2000 dollars
were stowed. As we had neither, I
could not tell him. He persisted that
we had as he had information from
Canton that it was put on board. In
the mean time they were rifling every
place on board the ship, breaking the
hatches open &c., and dragging me
with them, with continual threats of
shooting me &c. As day was breaking
they all at once at a signal left the
ship, leaving me in the main hold. I
extinguished all the lights they had
been using, and watched the junk
leaving the ship. I then got on deck
and with the second mate, began to
muster the men, when we found two
missing viz. James Collier (A. B.) and
William Tally (A. B.) We think they
might have been chased over the
Bows and shot in the water. All the
remainder of the crew were unhurt,
myself being the only one with either
marks or bruises. The pirates had
robbed the vessel of a portion of the
cargo, ships stores, and furniture, and
crew's and master's effects and break-
ing the cabin lockers, and doors and
rifling the cabin of everything of
value.{{< /news/text >}}

CHINA
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The fortnight which has since elap-
sed has been rather barren of polit-
ial events. Their is not a word of
news obtainable from Peking, where
Sir R. Alcock must have arrived at the
last of this month. The nature of His
Excellency's reception at the court at
Peking may in some degree indicate
forthcoming events, and therefore the
advices communicating his arrival are
looked forward to with some degree
of curiosity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It seems to be pretty well understood
that anti-foreign Consuls are the order
of the day at Peking. There is no
doubt, either that Prince Kung was
degraded because of his supposed
pro-foreign aspirations, or that his re-
elevation to power is to be ascribed to
the discovery that this supposition was
a grave error. Since the late evacua-
tion of the Taku forts much labor and
outlay have been expended in streng-
thening the fortifications,—-in fact, it
is said that when the plan adopted
shall be carried out, these forts will be
impregnable except to iron-clads. The
proceeding is significant when taken
in connection with the anti-foreign
policy known to be cherished, but at
the same time there can be no reason-
able objection urged against the Chi-
nese government fortifying their Capi-
tal. On the contrary, the Mandarins
will surely find that whilst they will
be required to fulfill their proper du-
ties and to perform their responsibili-
ties, every measure adopted to streng-
then their hands and elevate their
prestige, will be heartily supported.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The whereabout of Tseng-kwo-fan
is still a mystery, and the precise
position of affairs as between the main
body of the Imperial army under his
command and that of the Nienfei, is
not known with any degree of precis-
ion. Rumor still has it that the Im-
perial troops have suffered a defeat
and are retreating on the Yellow Riv-
er, and although these reports are not
authenticated, still they are generally
credited.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These Nine-fei insurgents are also
appearing in force far to the westward
of the scene of the Tseng-kow-fan's
operation. It appears that the Pek-
ing Cabinet ordered the Governor
General of the two Kiangs, (ex-Footai
Li) to dismiss all the foreign drill in-
structers mercenaries in military em-
ploy. Of these there are still a num-
ber at various posts, the whole being
British subjects with the exception
of a few Frenchmen. Li hesitated to
carry out the order and wrote to Pek-
ing for fresh instructions, representing
that the services of these mercenaries
at the present juncture were much re-
quired, and soliciting a postponement
of the order, which was granted. It is
probable that this circumstance was
the origin of the rumor which prevailed
to the effect that the service of the
foreigners in the customhouse employ
should be dispensed with at the end of
the year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}An Imperial victory over the Tai-
pings attended with the death of the in-
surgent leader, is reported to have ta-
ken place at Fuhkin. The previous
impression was that the Taipings have
been driven out of the Fuhkien prov-
ince, and the accounts of the present
victory do not therefore sound very
well.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would appear that some official
degradations have taken place in the
Province of Sze-chuen, and it is pretty
well understood that the Chinese gov-
ernment have accorded the French
Minister ample satisfaction for the
late outrage committed on the Roman
Catholic missionaries in the province.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prussian government has assur-
edly designs of some kind on Formosa.
Some few years ago they had a store
ship called the Elbe in these seas car-
rying a pennant-—the Commander of
her managed to embroil himself with
the authorities of Singapore, and also
with those of Hong Kong. He after-
wards visited Formosa, and embroil-
ed himself there. Some of his crew
whilst on shore on liberty were mal-
treated. This is said to be the pretext
for a demand for satisfaction on the
Chinese government, which demand,
rumour has it, is to be accompanied by
a requirement that the Mandarins shall
be responsible for the good behaviour
of Prussian subjects of the inhabitants
of Formosa, which, seeing that the is-
land is principally inhabited by vicious
untameable savages, is an impractica-
ble arrangement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Hongkong Mint is expected
to be in operation in about three
months. The local authorities of this
colony, about two years ago, establish-
ed a small coin currency, which has
met with such singular success, that
the supplies (from London) which were
deemed liberal, have failed to supply
the demand. There is very little
doubt that the dollar to be coined here
will supersede all others now in circul-
ation in China, and so, a large pro-
portion of the silver which now finds
its way to London and New York, will
be sent here direct so soon as the line
of steamers between San Francisco
and this port shall be established. The
only fear is, that the local authorities
may mismanage the affair. They are
clearly nervous on the point, and have
already taken a very questionable step.
Uninfluenced by the experience which
they might have derived from the suc-
cess of small coin currency, apparently
oblivious to the desirability of feeding
the market gradually, they have an-
nounced that for the first two months
after the opening of the Mint, silver will
be coined free of seignorage! The
banks are clearly alarmed lest the new
currency should supersede the old, for
they have already decreased the circul-
ation of their notes about one half.
The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce
is also alive to the contingency, and
at a meeting on the subject it was
suggested that the device should be a
permanent one, and not the head of
the reigning sovereign—-an excellent
suggestion, which however came too
late to be available. The local govern-
ment would probably have confined the
operations to issuing a sufficient a-
mount to meet the pay of H. M. forces
and local requirements—unfortunately
the Home Government are dictating
such harsh terms as to render acquies-
cence almost ruinous to the colony.{{< /news/text >}}

Mutiny
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The last fortnight has not been
signalised by any remarkable events
in the North, but a very important
inquiry has been held here before a
Marine Court, into the circumstances
of a mutiny which has taken place on
board a coolie ship called The Pride
of the Ganges. The vessel which left
Whampoa on the 8th of December,
came into Hongkong on the 1st of
this month, reporting that when off
the island of Hainan, the coolies had
suddenly and unexpectedly mutinied,
had killed the captain and purser and
had forced the mate and crew to take
them to Hainan. This was done, the
coolies all landed, and the mate then
brought the vessel back to Hongkong.
On the 6th the inquiry was opened
before a Marine Court. The chief mate,
Richard Vivers, said that the vessel
was a British barque commanded by
William Jack. She had been loading
with coolies at Whampoa since about
the 8th of October; altogether she
took in 301 coolies bound for Dem-
erara. The crew consisted of seven-
teen in all, the captain, two mates,
one supernumerary acting as purser,
storekeeper, coolie, steward, eight
able, and two ordinary seamen. The
only barricades on board were two;
one separating the married people
from the single men, and one keeping
the passengers out of the after cabin,
but interfering in no way with their
free circulation about the deck. They
were allowed to move about as they
pleased, on the poop or any where else.
The seamen slept forward and unarm-
ed, although they remonstrated with
the captain on this arrangement and
pointed out that they might all be kill-
ed if a rising should take place. There
were some few muskets on board, but
at the critical moment it appeared that
they were unloaded and that the am-
munition was not immediately at hand.
There had been some dissatisfaction
amongst the coolies before the ship
left Whampoa, about the rice supplied
them, which appears from the evidence
to have been of an inferior kind, and
also about the advances. The coolies
first engaged received $10 with which
they were content at the time, but the
market went up and the last batches
were engaged at an advance of $15.
The original coolies on hearing of this,
claimed the extra $5 and it was grant-
ed to them. In spite of this, the ris-
ing took place in the way discribed
and the captain and purser were murd-
ered very cruelly. The finding of the
Marine Court has not yet been deter-
mined on, but the moral of the whole
transaction is of the simplest kind.
Proper barricades to keep coolies from
the quarter deck, and loaded arms,
are just as essential to the safety of a
vessel carrying Chinese passengers as
the rudder and the sails.{{< /news/text >}}

Romantic story of Stratford,
Connecticut.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}That such a town as Stratford should
afford anything in the way of romantic
personal history was hardly to be ex-
pected, but the subjoined story is au-
thentic as well as interesting.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"At the commencement of the pres-
sent century a young man made his ap-
pearance in the village, and spent a
few weeks in the tavern which then
existed to afford shelter to stage coach
travelers. Whence he came and what
his business, none could guess. Di-
rectly opposite the tavern stood the
small cottage and the forge of a black-
smith named Folsom. He had a daugh-
ter who was the village beauty, and
it was her fortune to captivate the heart
of the young stranger.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He told his love, said that he was
from Scotland, that he was traveling
incog., but in confidence gave her his
real name, claiming that he was
heir to a large fortune. She return-
ed his love and they were married.
A few weeks thereafter the stranger
told his wife that he must visit New
Orleans; he did so, and the gossips of
the town made the young wife unhappy
by their disagreeable hints and jeers.
In a few months the husband return-
ed, but before a week had elapsed he
received a large budget of letters, and
told his wife that he must at once re-
turn to England, and must go alone.
He took his departure, and the gos-
sips had another glorious opportunity
to make a confiding woman wretched.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To all but herself it was a clear case
of desertion; the wife became a moth-
er, and for two years lived in silence
and in hope. At the end of that time
a letter was received by the Stratford
beauty from her husband, directing her
to go at once to New York with her
child, taking nothing with her but the
clothes she wore, and embark in a ship
for his home in England. On her ar-
rival in New York she found a ship
splendidly furnished with every
convenience and luxury for her comfort,
and two servants ready to obey every
wish she might express.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The ship duly arrived in England,
and the Stratford girl became the mis-
tress of a superb mansion, and, as the
wife of a baronet, was saluted by the
aristocracy as Lady Samuel Sterling.
On the death of her husband, many
years ago, the Stratford boy succeed-
ed to the title and wealth of his father,
and in the last edition of the "Peerage
and Barontage," he is spoken of as the
issue of "Miss Folsom, of Stratford,
North America." When the late Prof.
Stillman visited England some years
since, he had the pleasure of meeting
Lady Sterling at a dinner party, and
was delighted to answer her many
questions about her birth-place in Con-
necticut.—-Lorain County News.{{< /news/text >}}

February, 1st 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The latest news from the U. S. Ameri-
ca is to us exceedingly interesting."The
irrepressible conflict" is not yet over.
And while justice and injustice to the
four millions of Africans in the south-
ern states are the cause of it, we hope
and pray that it may never stop until
the African wherever found, shall be
acknowledged a man in every member
and faculty of his being, and as such
worthy of all the rights of the white
man. While the late civil war broke
the fetters of those millions of our
brothers, it failed to give them equal
rights with their white neighbors' of
equal grade of intellect and worthiness.
There are mighty and terrible influences
at work in the political arena of the
U. S. to prevent the Africans at the
South from ever blotting out the most
unmerciful stigma with which the
whites, by 200 years of slavery, have
branded them. A vast majority at
the South and a strong party at the
North are doing their utmost to pre-
vent the enactment of laws by which
any of them, even the well educated,
from ever coming to the polls, and thus
asserting that they are really and fully
citizens of the U. S. The following
extract from the N. Y. Independent
to so well expresses our views, we gladly
give it the place of our own editorial.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
"The Good Fight."
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}"We reiterate our battle-cry of equal
rights! Many kindly voices and fav-
oring presses are swelling the appeal.
Every Sabbath adds to the cause some
new pulpit; every week-day, some new
editorial pen. As yet, the popular
voice only half expresses the popular
conscience. Like a smouldering fire,
there is a suppressed conviction on the
great subject, which, when it breaks
into full utterance, will sweep the
country. Among a free people a just
cause grows apace; every day adds
fiber to its trunk and greenness to its
leaf, till it stands at last a Cedar of
Lebanon. Already the belief posses-
ses a majority of Christian minds that
this nation was shaken with war in
order "that the things which cannot
be shaken might remain." These are
the great principles of Human Rights,
on which this Government is waiting
to lay its only sure foundation. These
principles which, in one form or an-
other, have always kept the American
people under the salutary necessity of
free discussion, are now coming them-
selves into a national question, and its
image and superscription is Equal Suff-
rage. To men who used to be mob-
bed for demanding the Abolition of
Slavery, it is now refreshing to see the
whole nation advancing like an army
toward the next great controversy—
Political Equality. Some over-wearied
friends are saying, "Let us now fold
our hands a while, and enjoy the pres-
ent victory." Not so! Stopping to
enjoy Capua, Hannibal lost Rome.
Stopping to-day contented with Eman-
cipation, we shall to-morrow lose Equal
Suffrage. Therefore, O friends, girt
your loins! Welcome the remaining
toils! The noblest discussion which
ever engaged a free people is now op-
ening. Of the result, we have no fear.
Never was our faith firmer, our hope
fairer, our zeal for labor in the Good
Old Cause more ardent, than in these
crisp October days!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The President's singular declaration
that "Universal Suffrage in the South
would breed a war of races," so forci-
bly reminds us of the old story that
Emancipation also would create "a
war of races," that we will dismiss his
apprehension as too familiar a ghost
to be feared. The letter of Abraham
Lincoln found upon the dead body of
General Wadsworth declares that he
meant to grant "universal amnesty,"
and to exact universal suffrage." Did
Abraham Lincoln apprehend "a war
of races?" Not at all! On the con-
trary, he foresaw that Amnesty would
carry joy to the rebels, and Suffrage
joy to the negroes, and that, as a conse-
quence, instead of a "war of races" all
the bells would ring Glory Hallelujah!
O that the mantle of Elijah may yet
fall upon Elisha!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Meanwhile we plant ourselves upon
the rock of EQUAL SUFFRAGE. Be-
lieving this position to be right, to be
manly, to be Christian, God forbid our
feet to be moved therefrom a single
inch—nay, a single hair! Through
evil and through good report, we trust
to be able to maintain an unwavering
testimony to the truth. We solemnly
believe that the word for the hour is
Equal Rights! This is the dictate of
Justice—-this is the claim of Human-
ity. Parties must heed it-—Adminis-
trations must conform to it! Its march
shall be as irresistible as Time! It
shall sweep with majesty into the Na-
tional Capitol, and, shall seat itself in
sovereignty as the Supreme Law of
the Land! To-day; in advance, there-
fore, we salute the coming victory, and
cry joyfully ALL HAIL."{{< /news/text >}}

America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Several of the agents of the Freed-
men's Bureau have officially called
attention to the fact that great suffer-
ing will probably exist among the ne-
groes during the approaching winter,
and that the mortality among them is
fearful and increasing. In one district
over 900 died out of a body of less
than 4,000 within six months. The
mortality among the children and the
aged is particularly great.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The President has approved the sen-
tence of death passed by a court-mar-
tial in Georgia upon two white sold-
iers for the murder of a coloured wo-
man.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Rev. George B. Cheever, one
of the most prominent abolition cler-
gymen in the United States, at a lec-
ture in his church in New York, made
a most violent assault upon the course
adopted by President Johnson, with
whom he declared the Northern people
were greatly dissatisfied, and who was
acting as though he owned the coun-
try, and could do with its inhabitants
as he pleased. The speaker further
declared that Mr. Johnson acted more
like a counsel for the rebels than Pre-
sident of the United States, and that
public opinion—long suppressed—
would soon be heard against him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The discharge of Captain Waddell
and his crew by the British authorities
was unconditional, and not restricted
by parole as at first reported. We
should not be too quick in construing
this to be an unfriendly act of the
new cabinet. The fact that our mi-
nister did not ask the detention of any
one connected with the ship is an in-
dication that in his judgment no such
claim could be sustained. In our pre-
sent limited knowledge of the facts, it
is our business to assume that he re-
frained from acting for good reasons.
We cannot consistently blame the Bri-
tish Government for failing to make
an extradition which was never de-
manded. Moreover, the surrender of
the Shenandoah to our consul at Liver-
pool as a Confederate war vessel, and
his acceptance of the ship in that
character, precludes us from all com-
plaint against the British authorities
for discharging the officers and crew.
We could have no claim for the ex-
tradition of those men, except as pi-
rates. Whether piracy committed up-
on ships on the high seas comes with-
in the scope of the Ashburton treaty,
which relates only to felonies commit-
ted "within the jurisdiction" of either
nation, is a debatable point. But were
our claim for the extradition for pira-
cy under the treaty ever so clear, we
should be stopped from pursuing it by
our acceptance of the ship as a Con-
federate vessel of war. If the vessel
itself retained that belligerent charac-
ter, no hostile act committed against
our commerce by those on board of it
could have been piratical. Having ac-
cepted the Shenandoah as a Confede-
rate vessel, it is not for us to denounce
the British Government for treating
its officers and crew as mere belliger-
ents, and not trying them for piracy
in its own tribunals. Yet it is morally
certain that the actual offence of pi-
racy was committed. Conceding that
the Shenandoah had a belligerent
character up to the close of the re-
bellion, and indeed up to the time
when the news of that close reached
the seas which the ship was infesting,
it then lost that character, and became
a cruiser without a flag. Captain Wad-
dell's pretence that he continued to
sail for months ignorant that the Con-
federacy no longer existed, is bold
impudence. He had no official noti-
fication of the "fact," and could have
none, because the authority which
commissioned him no longer existed.
But American captains have made
affidavit that they personally made
known to him the fact of the termi-
nation of the war long before he ceased
to make war. What is more, proba-
ble not one of the vessels which he
boarded and destroyed during the
summer months was without some
newspaper from the Pacific coast, or
other quarter, abounding with conclu-
sive evidence that the Confederacy
had come to an end. There has not
been a copy of an American newspa-
per published for the last seven months
from which any man not absolutely
idiotic could not gather that the Rich-
mond government was no longer in
existence. Waddell unquestionably
knew all through the summer that he
was robbing and burning without any
living authority; and yet, according
to his own published statement, it was
the very last day of summer before
he shipped his guns and stopped his
work. Whatever he may originally
have been, he became a pirate to all
intents and purposes; and no pirate
ever more richly deserved hanging.
Were he in the hands of our govern-
ment, hanging would almost certainly
be his fate. But as the matter has
turned, he has as good a prospect as
any other man of dying in his bed.
It is a curious result, and not very
creditable to the boasted civilisation
and law of the age. N. Y. Times.{{< /news/text >}}

Mexico.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The news from Mexico is even more
than usually contradictory. The recent
report that the Imperialists had aban-
doned the Northern States, and were
concentrating at Mexico, Vera Cruz,
and San Luis Potosi, to await the ar-
rival of reinforcements, is effectually
contradicted. Vera Cruz dates to Nov-
ember 13th state that Michoacan and
Oajaca had been cleared of Republi-
cans and guerillas, and that a force of
600 under General Guzman, had been
captured, and the leaders shot, in ac-
cordance with the recent decrees by
Maximillian. The emperor had ap-
pointed General J. B. Magruder, late
of the Confederate army, surveyor-
general of colony lands.{{< /news/text >}}

France.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The arrival in Paris a few days ago
of the American General Schofield has
given rise to much comment in the
Paris press. It is said that he is en-
trusted with the rather delicate task of
negotiating for the withdrawal of the
French troops from Mexico, and for
an alliance offensive and defensive be-
tween Paris and Washington in the
contingency of a war with England. 
But the Constitutionnel says the
French government has no knowledge
of any such mission, and the writer
adds that he believes the news to be
pure invention. Another announce-
ment is that the general is not entrusted
with any political mission, and that he
visits Europe for the benefit of his
health, with the intention of making
a lengthened stay on the continent.
The other papers, however, persist in
asserting that General Schofield is en-
trusted with a mission.{{< /news/text >}}

supposed to represent the kings and
chiefs of the various dependencies of
Siam, who are coming to witness the
ceremonies of the hair cutting, and
who perform a sort of simultaneous
war dance as they chant "O rah pho

{{< news/text >}}The king, dressed in state, receives
the young prince from his nobles,
places him at his right hand, and pre-
sents him to the multitude assembled
who do him homage. After which he
is handed to two honorable ladies, sis-
ters of His Excellency the Prime Mi-
nister, who carefully conducted him
down the marble steps of the Pavilion,
at the foot of which stand two young
and pretty damsels, who put his feet
into a silver basin, pour on them wa-
ter from a silver urn, wiping them in
fine linen. On his way to the Phra
Sârt he is met by another group of
beautifully dressed damsels, who dance
before him holding palms and bran-
ches of gold in their hands. He is
then conducted to an inner chamber
of the Phra Sârt which is prepared to
receive him, is seated on a "Ken-
kaub" carpet heavily fringed with gold,
and made to recline on a golden cush-
ion; before him was an alter with six
lighted candles, six gold vases con-
taining roasted rice, or Khow tawk, and
six others with fresh flowers as offer-
ings. In his hand is placed a strip of
palmyra leaf on which is inscribed a
line taken from the sacred Buddhistic-
al books as a charm. Four young
damsels, also richly dressed, fan him,
and he is fed in small delicate morsels
by the ladies in waiting, which he opens
his mouth to receive at their hands.
A soft looking round ball of raw
thread which is here used (as did the
Romans of old) to keep out witchcraft,
the ends of which is first bound tightly
round the sacred hill, and then carried
into the Phra Suan, and laid on the
head of the young prince, from which
is carried nine threads over the altar
and the dividing screen into the next
chamber, where the royal priesthood of
Siam are seated. In to the palms of their
folded hands they are passed along,
and backward forming a magic circle
to receive effectual consecration and
benediction.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After the top-knot is removed, the
young prince is dressed in a new suit,
makes handsome offerings to the priests,
and is conducted to the foot of the hill
to receive his bath, when the custodians
from the N. S. E. and W. of the sa-
cred mount assemble to pour upon him
the sacred waters from their mouths.
His Majesty, who represented Phra
In Suan, then ascends the top of the
mount.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After which the prince is conducted
by his chief augels[?]—the two Prime
Ministers, to receive his blessing.
For three evenings after the top-knot
has been removed votive offerings are
made by lighted tapers being carried
round and round the hill, and the
younger royal brothers perform a war
dance during the offering.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This was the time when the presents
were made to the young prince, and it
was astonishing to see the contribu-
tions in gold, money, jewels, etc, that
were laid at his feet.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The presents made by the king were
also enormous. All the nobles and
chiefs received gold birds, little boxes
of gold jewels &c. All the nobles
who took a part in the procession re-
ceived four ticals each day. The cap-
tains and officers from two to four
ticals a day. The children of the nobles,
from two and upwards a day. The

{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A royal Mandate.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Issued on the 7th-of January 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}This is to communicate the sad
intelligence that the younger full
brother of His Majesty the supreme
king, generally known by the title P'rà
Bât Somdêtch P'rà Pin-Klow Chów-
yu-hua, as also by the still more com-
mon title The Wâng-nà had long been
sick of a disease depriving him of all
relish for food, and producing a con-
tinual state of vigilance by which he
scarcely ever obtained any refreshing
repose. His strength steadily declined.
The royal physicians prescribed for
him, and the shampooing doctors did
their best to afford relief. Many times
the disease would appear to yield and
as often to relapse. From the 7th
Siamese month (June 1865) until
the fore part of the 1st month (latter
part of Nov.) his symptoms became
much more alarming in spite of all
that the whole corps of royal physi-
cians could do. On Sunday Jan. 7th
at 18 minutes past 9 o'clock A. M. His
Majesty the late 2nd king departed
this life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty the supreme king, be-
ing present with his full-younger
brother, gave commands to the per-
sons to whom it belonged, to prepare
the royal corpse with all the usual in-
signia of royalty, and place it in the
royal urn; and had the urn placed on
the throne called Itisrn-winichei in
the 2nd king's palace, according to
the custom in vogue for deceased
kings during the three last reigns.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This being done, His Majesty issued
commands to the two Prime Minis-
ters of the South and North, and the
Minister of Foreign affairs to write
letters under their respective seals to
all the Provinces at the South and at
the North, and to foreign countries,
and to all nations in treaty relations
with Siam, giving all to learn the sad
intelligence of the demise of His Ma-
jesty the late king of Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There were also royal orders then
issued that all citizens of Siam who
have taken the oath of allegiance un-
der lords and masters, together with
the prai Loong (people belonging
especially to the king,) and the com-
mon people who belong to nobles, lords,
and masters under the jurisdiction of
the WANGNA (second king,) and to all
governors under said jurisdiction as
well as nobles, lords, and magistrates.
Let all such together with their wives
and children, -dependants and slaves,
male and female, every one, shave his
head. Let none be excused excepting
children wearing their top-knots, and
persons whose custom it is to wear a
ope, and Chinese and women who are
accustomed to wear long hair. But
all persons who cut their hair as the
Siamese do, both male and female, let
every one of these resolve to submit
to this custom of showing respect to
the younger full-brother of the king
—the Pra-bat Somdetsh P'ra Pin
Klow Chôw-ya-hua, whose royal re-
mains are now in the palace of the
WANGNA.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let all such as are above designated
shave their heads on the 1st day of
every moon from the 3rd Month until
the funeral obsequies for His Majesty
the late second king shall have been
closed in the of the year of the tiger
(March 1867) the 8th of the decade.
Chinese who are marked on the back
of the hand and come under the ju-
risdiction of the WANGNA, let all such
attach white silk instead of black to
their cues, and thus follow their own
custom for showing respect to the
royal dead.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But all Siamese and Chinese, male
and female, who belong to the juris-
diction of the WANG-LUANG (the su-
preme king) or who fall under the ju-
risdiction of foreigners, themselves,
their wives and children, their servants
and slaves, male and female, who are
not in any proper sense under the
jurisdiction of the WANGNA, none such
are at all required by this command
to shave their heads or wear white
silk attached to their cues. Let all such
dress their heads as they have been

the city of Bangkok and throughout

A royal Birth.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Birth of another royal son being the
77th offspring, and the 39th son of H.
M. the Supreme King of Siam, from
the 29th mother being the 2nd, at 11
minutes past 5. A. M. civil day, 30th
January 1866.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}We are glad to learn that Mr.
Thomson, (as per Advertisement in
another column,) will leave the splend-
ed views he has taken in Bangkok and
other principal cities of Siam, in the care
of Capt. S. J. B. Ames, Commissioner
of Police, where they can seen by any
Connoisseur of the Photographic art
who may wish see them. We think
H. M. the king is quite right in de-
signating Mr. Thomson, the good Pho-
tographer. We learn that Mr. T.
has left his printer who will execute
orders for his pictures as formerly.
There need be no fear that the prin-
ting will be executed with less skill
during the absence of Mr. T. We wish
our friend much success in his efforts
to picture the interesting views of
Ongcor.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The carelessness of those in charge
of rafts of timber and bamboos com-
ing down the river are likely to lead
to serious accidents. A few evenings
ago a raft of bamboo was being floated
down the river, in direct line with the
shipping moored in the harbour, sweep-
ing past them with great velocity, un-
till it stuck fast across the bows of a
barque; and had she not been well
moored, would have swept her away
with the current, probably taking the
vessel astern along with her, and by
their united force sweeping all the
vessels below along with them. Thus a
vast amount of property would have
been destroyed for the want of a lit-
tle care by those in charge of the raft.
As it was, the raft, not being very
firmly put together, broke across the
bows of the barque, and sped on its
way. The next vessel had timely
warning by the cracking and snapping
of the bamboos across the barque’s
bows, and sheered clear of the dan-
ger.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Where is PENELOPE BROWN who
came and introduced herself to the for-
mer editor of the "Bangkok Recorder"
and proposed to write a series of arti-
cles for the paper, and in whose pro-
position we took a lively interest? Has
she become disgusted with the change
which has taken place in the editorial
department, and hence withdrawn? or
did she find she had undertaken a job
too onerous for one of her delicate
frame? Judging from the spirit and
power of the article she sent as the
first of a series, we are not inclined to
think this of her. Will she please to
let us know from whence she hails,
and why she has thus disappointed us?{{< /news/text >}}

Transit of Mails.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In our issue of the 4th instant we
gave a memo. of the number of days
occupied in the transit of the Outward
mails to this Port. We intend in our
present issue to lay before our readers
another memo. which has been care-
fully compiled and sent to us for
publication which shews the manner
in which he Homeward Mail contract
has been performed from the 10th of
January to the 21st of October 1865.
The quickest transit viâ Marseilles
has been in 34 days. This was the
Mail which left this Port per P. & O.
steamer Benares, on the 23rd of April
last year, and taken on to Suez from
Galle by the Mail steamer Simla. The
latest transit via Southampton was
in 38 days This was the Mail which
left Singapore per P. & O. steamer
Singapore, on the 23rd March last
year and arrived in London on the
30th April. On six occasions the Mails
reached viâ Marseilles in 35 days.
Twice during the year the Mails ar-
rived in London viâ Marseilles in 36
days. The longest transit has been
46 days viâ Marseilles. These were
the Mails which left this Port on the
21st May and 22nd June. The delay
was attributable to the long passage
of the Mail steamers Candia and
Golconda which conveyed the mails
from Galle to Suez. The following
is a table of the departures of the
mail steamers during last year, and
the number of days occupied in the
transit ;—{{< /news/text >}}

Assault on an Editor.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following shews the dangers
which surround the editorial chair
in Ceylon. The plaintiff is the editor
of the Ceylon Examiner:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"This morning (Friday, 27th Oc-
tober.) Mr. Cruwell and another tall
person (since ascertained to be Lieute-
nant Stubbs, of the 2-25th entered Mr.
Lorenz's house, and on being shewn into
his office-room (by Mrs. Lorenz,) the
former asked Mr. Lorenz for an apo-
logy for certain letters and articles
which had appeared in the Examiner.
Mr. Lorenz said that he would only
be too willing to apologize for them,
if Mr. Cruwell would state to him as
a gentleman that the statements therein
were not founded on fact. On this
understanding, Mr. Lorenz proceeded
to write a few paragraphs, when Mr.
Cruwell objected to any reference be-
ing made to his own assertion of the
fact being incorrect. Mr. Lorenz said
he could not suppress that important
fact, as that was the only ground on
which the article could be retracted or
qualified. Mr. Cruwell then produced
a large whip and inflicted a blow on
Mr. Lorenz's back. Mr. Lorenz, seiz-
ing a rule on the table struck Mr. Cru-
well a blow on the forehead: but see-
ing him walking out hastely, he called
for his servants, and about ten or fif-
teen of them, accompanied by his ne-
phew, rushing out, found Mr. Cruwell
in the act of getting into his carriage.
He was calling out to the horse-keeper
to drive on, when he was at once
pulled out, and received a very severe
beating from the house to the gate,
where Mr. Cruwell and his friend,
fairly took to their heels and ran away.
It is said that, Mr. Cruwell received a
very severe beating and was seen run-
ning down hill in a very tattered con-
dition.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"During the day, a warrant was
issued against Mr. Cruwell by Mr. D.
De Saram, Police Magistrate on an af-
fidavit by Mr. Lorenz for an assault
in his house. Mr. Cruwell was brought
up before the Magistrate, and on read-
ing the affidavit, agreed to its general
accuracy, but demurred to his being
called a man of a violent temper. Mr.
Lorenz said he would - not press the
assault case, as Mr. Cruwell had met
with such severe treatment from his
(Mr. L.'s) servants. The Magistrate
thereupon bound Mr. Cruwell over to
keep the peace in £1600-—Mr. C. him-
self £800, and two others (Mr. Har-
rison and Dr. Kelson, who became
sureties) for £400 each.{{< /news/text >}}
