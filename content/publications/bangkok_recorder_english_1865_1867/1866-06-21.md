America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The House of Representatives, following
the example of the Senate had passed the
Civil Rights Bill over the President's veto
by 122 to 41 votes. The bill is now law.
The House had also instructed the Judici-
ary Committee to inquire if there is pro-
bable cause to believe that Mr. Davis and
others were implicated in the assassination
of President Lincoln, or are guilty of treas-
on; and, if so, what measures necessary
to bring them to a speedy trial. The scene
in the House, at the passage of the Civil
Rights Bill, was one of great excitement.
On the question being put, "Shall the bill
pass, notwithstanding the objections of
the President?" a call was made and every
member's voice could be plainly heard as
be answered "Yea" or "Nay." At the
close it was 121 to 41. Then Speaker Col-
fax asked to have his name called, and vo-
ted "Aye," making it 122 to 41, or three to
one. As soon as he announced the vote,
the members upon the Republican side
commenced to applaud, and the galleries
taking up the cue broke out in a wild and
tumultuous cheering for several minutes.
The Speaker rapped, but it was of no use.
Ladies waved their handkerchiefs and men
continued to applaud. Finally the Speak-
er waved his hand, and the noise subsid-
ed somewhat, when he recognised a mem-
ber who moved to adjourn. This motion
was carried, and the galleries continued to
applaud for some minutes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On April 12, the Senate passed the Loan
Bill in the same form as it was passed by
the House of Representatives. The Presi-
dent subsequently signed the bill.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was semi-officially announced on April
14 that the State department, in view of
the Fenian agitation, had long since issu-
ed orders for the preservation of neutrali-
ty on the nothern borders. The United
States gun-boat Winooski had been dis-
patched to Eastport.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The California Legislature had passed
a resolution calling upon the government
to interfere in order to prevent the esta-
blishment of the Mexican monarchy.{{< /news/text >}}

LATEST.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The 'Times' Washington correspondent,
under date of April 15, says:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Fenians are once more making mys-
terious movements towards the Canadian
frontier, and the colonists seem uneasy res-
pecting the intentions of the American gov-
ernment. I am happy to be able to inform
you, on the highest authority, that or-
ders have been given by the government
of a nature to prevent any organised ex-
pedition of Fenians setting out for Canada
or any where else. The government is de-
sirous of avoiding coming into conflict
with the Fenians as long as it possibly can,
but it will not suffer any violation of the
laws of neutrality to be attempted. Mea-
sures have been taken to carry out this in-
tention of the government, and I believe
that Mr. Staunton and one other member of
the Cabinet were alone in opposing this
course. Mr. Staunton would let the Fenians
make war how they pleased, and even give
them help, so intense is his bitterness to-
wards England on account of its alleged
violation of neutrality during the late War,
but the Cabinet is controlled by wiser
men, and the American government will
do what is right as soon as the Fenians
give it sufficient cause to interfere.{{< /news/text >}}

British North America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Fenians were again exciting un-
easiness in British America. A Quebec
despatch says:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Large numbers of Fenians were, on
April 10, gathering along the New Bruns-
wick frontier, and threatening Campobello
and St. Stephens. Two hundred Fenians
left Portland, Maine, on the 9th, for East-
port, on the Canadian frontier, and a
schooner had been chartered to carry arms.
Murphy, the president of the Toronto Hi-
bernian Society, and five others had been
arrested in Canada, EN ROUTE for Port-
land. Arms and ammunition were found
upon them. On the 12th the Fenian Con-
vention was in session at Eastport, in
Maine. The town was crowded with Fe-
nians, and there were several Fenian ves-
sels in the harbour, armed with howitzers
and 20-pounders. A sailing vessel escap-
ed to sea, notwithstanding the presence of
the United States marshal in Eastport.
Arms and ammunition were arriving at
different points along the New Brunswick
frontier. Several British gun-boats were
off Eastport and Campobello, keeping
steam up and portholes open, and this at-
titude has caused a hostile feeling among
American sympathizers with the Fenian
cause, numbers of whom, together with
some British deserters, were joining the
Fenians. A suspicious-looking steamer,
showing American colours, had proceed-
ed up Eastport River towards St. Andrews.
Communication between St. John's and the
western towns on the British side was re-
ported to have been cut by the Fenians.
The garrison of Campobello had been rein-
forced, and earthworks had been thrown
up. The Canadian authorities believed that
the movement on New Brunswick was a
feint to cover an attack upon Canada, in
conjunction with gun-boats from Chicago.
At Toronto, Fenian arrests and the search
for arms continued. The British gun-boat
Pleiades put to sea from Eastport on the
12th. It was rumoured, apparently with-
out any foundation, that her crew had
mutinied.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The governor of New Brunswick had
unconditionally accepted the resignation
of the anti-Federation cabinet. No new
ministry was formed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The steamer England, from Liverpool,
with 1300 persons on board, had put into
Halifax for medical assistance, having
160 cases of cholera and 60 deaths. She
remains at Halifax strictly quarantined.
The captain believes some German pas-
sengers brought the epidemic aboard.{{< /news/text >}}

by the Liberals in Coahuila, with the loss
of 140 killed. One hundred Americans
had invaded Sonora, ostensibly in pursuit
of Indians. Their intentions were not
positively known. The imperial com-
mander at Chihuahua had shot three cap-
tured Liberal chiefs.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The 'Constitutionnel' of April 21 pub-

Limayrac, in which it remarks upon the
impatience of those journals which desire
to have explanations from the French
government on the state of affairs in Ger-
many. The article reminds those journals
that France is not mixed up, either direct-
ly or indirectly, with the questions at
issue between the two great German
Powers, and continues that;—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The government of the emperor has no
right to interfere. It regards the conflict
as a spectator only, following, however,
its different phases with the same vigilance
and solicitude which it bestows upon all
important questions of foreign policy.
The imperial government cannot pro-
nounce its opinion upon a conflict which
assumes to many different phases, and
undergoes almost every day fresh modi-
fications. Moreover, the French govern-
ment could not express its opinion pub-
licly without sharing in the discussion up-
on the questions at issue.{{< /news/text >}}

Later.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The ‘Constitutionnel’ of yesterday
publishes an article upon the German
question, signed by M. Paulin Limayrac,
demonstrating that France could do no-
thing better during the German difficulty
than preserve, with entire neutrality, all
liberty of action and every means of in-
fluence for the moment when they might
be usefully employed. The writer con-
tinues:–-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Facts justify the course taken by the
emperor. Left to themselves, Prussia
and Austria have agreed to disarm, but
it is very doubtful whether foreign in-
terference would have more easily ob-
tained a similar result.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}According to the ‘Morgenpost’ of
Vienna, the Emperor Napoleon has de-
clared to the Italian Cabinet that he will
in no way assist Italy in case she should
attack Austria. ‘Morgenpost’ adds that
the news comes from an authentic source.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A meeting of the electors of the first
electoral district of Berlin was held on
April 18 in that city when the following
resolution, supported by several of the
Prussian deputies, was adopted.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With respect to Austria and Italy the
aspect of affairs is described as decidedly
warlike. A Vienna despatch of the even-
ing of April 24 says:–-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A telegram in the ‘Neue Frankfurter
Zeitung’ from Verona asserts that large
bodies of troops had been concentrated
at Bologna, and that Garibaldi had left
Caprera.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The ‘Independance Belge’ publishes
the text of Count von Bismarck’s des-
patch to Count Mensdorff, dated 21st
April :–“The Prussian minister receives
with satisfaction the propositions of the
Austrian minister, dated the 18th. He
expects further communications relative
to the extent and the days of the pro-
posed demobilisation of the Austrian
troops, in order that Prussia may pro-
ceed at the same time, and to equal ex-
tent, to the demobilisation of her own
forces.”{{< /news/text >}}

the inlet, and stretched chains across to
prevent the Spaniards approaching.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The affairs between Austria and Prussia
continue still in a critical state. Austria,
in replying to the Prussian note of the
15th of April, has submitted propositions
for mutual disarmament. The proposi-
tions are as follows:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That Austria and Prussia shall each
restore their military establishments to
the STATUS QUO which existed prior to the
late defensive measures.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That the 25th of April be the date
fixed for mutual disarmament.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Austria consents to disarm on that
date, but is even willing that Prussia
should disarm only on the 26th of April.
The Austrian proposition is stated to have
been communicated confidentially to Paris
and London, where it has been cordially
approved.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prussian answer to the above note
was despatched on April 21 to Vienna.
It says:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prussian armaments have been
caused by the Austrian military move-
ments in the vicinity of the Prussian
frontier. As soon as Prussia receives
authentic intelligence that the Austrian
armaments have been countermanded, in
the same proportion as the Austrian
armaments have been countermanded, in
the same proportion as the Austrian dis-
armament is proceeded with will that of
Prussia take place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Vienna 'Presse' of April 24 pub-
lishes a telegram from Berlin, stating
that in the above despatch addressed by
Prussia to Austria, the former Power ex-
press the expectation that the German
governments which have armed in ad-
dition to Austria will likewise counter-
mand their armaments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Count von Bismarck, in his reply to
an address in favour of peace, presented
by the Chamber of Commerce, says:—-
The king will, if possible, avoid war,
but the government cannot be guided
by considerations of national economy
alone. If war be necessary, the king
trusts in the tried readiness of the Cham-
ber of Commerce to make sacrifices.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}RUSSIA AND GERMANY.—-The latest ad-
vices from Berlin lead to the conclusion
that peace will be preserved. The Prus-
sian people have expressed a strong dis-
inclination for the war. The Federal
Diet has referred the Prussian proposal
of Reform to a special committee. The
middle States are holding a conference at
Augsburg.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}RUSSIA.—-Details are given of the late
attempt to assassinate the Czar. The
peasant who frustrated the assassin's aim
has been ennobled. The Minister of
Police has resigned, and been succeeded
by General Schouvaloff.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}KINGDOM OF ITALY.—-The grand total
of the army is over 350,000 men, of whom
240,000 might be mobilised at the short-

"LONDON AND CHINA EXPRESS" OFFICE,

{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prussia.-—The text-of the Prussian
despatch in answer to the last Austrian
note has been published. It is dated
"Berlin April, 21." Count Bismarck
says:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The King's Government accepts with
satisfaction the proposal contained in
Count Menadorff's despatch of April 18.
In accordance there-with, as soon as the
King's Government receives authentic in-
formation that his Majesty the Emperor
has ordered the displacement of troops re-
quired by preparation for war against
Prussia to be countermanded, his Majesty
the King will also upon his side immediate-
ly give orders for the reduction of those
portions of the army which have been in-
creased since the 27th of last month. His
Majesty will then have the execution of
this order carried out in the same degree,
and within the same period, in which the
corresponding diminution of the prepara-
tions for war of the Imperial Austrian ar-
my is actually effected. With regard to
the degree and the periods within which
these latter measures may take place, the
King's Government will therefore await
further communications from the Austrian
Cabinet, so as to be able accordingly to
keep equal step in its own disarmaments
with those of Austria. The King's Govern-
ment further assumes that the military
preparations commenced by other German
Governments will also be countermanded,
and that no further cause for measures of
military precaution may be given to it by
a continuation of their renewal."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE REFORM BILL.-—The Owl,—-gene-
rally well informed on such matters, says
—"In the case of an absolute defeat on the
second reading the Ministry will imme-
diately resign. If, however, as is possible,
the majority should barely reach two fi-
gures, thereby perilling the ultimate at-
tainment of a reduction of the franchise,
we believe it will result in the immediate
secession from the Cabinet of Earl Russell
and Mr. Gladstone. They will most pro-
bably be accompanied by advanced follow-
ers, such as Lord Hartington and Mr.
Goschen, leaving a portion of the existing
Ministry, who will be ready to form a
Coalition Government, with Lord Stanley,
Mr. Walpole, and Mr. Henley. The Oppo-
sition which will thus be formed will be a
strongly cohesive party, headed by Mr.
Gladstone, and might fairly be estimated
at a strength of about 250, exclusive of
the Irish members. Our opinion is that a
Coalition Government might last for two
or three Sessions, when a new general
election will have to settle the future bal-
ance of parties. Our readers will under-
stand that we give this simply as the pro-
bability of the hour, which may be altered
at any moment by current events."{{< /news/text >}}

OVER TRADE REPORT.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The last number of this report was
published on the 13th of May. In the
course of the fortnight which had then
just elapsed, the Hongkong Mint had
been opened by the GOVERNOR, and a
very large quantity of silver, amounting
to over $2,000,000 had been received for
coinage. It was found however, that al-
though the Mint was opened the new
dollars did not immediately begin to flow
from it. Some accidents to the machin-
ery, which occurred at the outset, were
speedily repaired, but it was found ne-
cessary to presmelt almost all the silver
received from the bankers before it was
possible to take an assay and give a re-
ceipt. It consisted almost entirely of old
Mexican dollars so dirty and impure that
the true weight of silver they contained
could only be determined by this process,
which necessitated considerable delay,
and occupied the melting furnaces at a
time when they were required for the
purpose of casting the silver into bars
for the rolling mills. At first, moreover,
it was found that the peculiar difficulties
in the way of producing the dollars, ow-
ing to the peculiarities of the design,
were almost too much for the coining
machinery with which the establishment
had been furnished.{{< /news/text >}}

returned to Yokohama after a stay at
Yeddo which is described as having been
very successful whether regarded merely
as a pleasure excursion or as an effort to

being the first time that any foreigners
have been allowed inside a Daimio's

But how long will it remain so. Not for

They are not many miles off and only
wait a favourable opportunity to advance
again and renew the scenes of plunder
that disgraced the Chinese Government
and name some few short months ago.
We have not had any news from Shensi
or Shansi lately. Rumour has had no-
thing to report of the formidable Moha-
medan rebels who kept the whole coun-
try to the Northward of the Yang-tse in
a state of anarchy. They are resting on
their oars somewhere, rejoicing in the
plunder gathered in during the past sea-
son. The Imperial forces, heaven save
the mark, are in winter quarters also we
presume, for since the defeat and death
of Sam-ko-lin-sin we have heard little or
nothing of them. If no news is good
news we might be justified in assuming
that the Northern and Western provin-
ces of China were tranquil and obedient,
but to jump to any such conclusion would
assuredly be premature.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}China, thanks to the assistance given
to the mandarins by our government is
in a far better position now than it was
three years ago. The worst enemies that
the Chinese government had ever to en-
counter,—-the Taiping hosts and their
fanatic leaders,—-have been crushed out.
British policy has strengthened the hands
of the Chinese authorities, in every way:
morally, physically, and financially. We
have recognized their claims and submit-
ted ourselves to their jurisdiction when
they had neither the desire to put for-
ward the one, nor the power to enforce
the other. We have compelled other
nations by our example and by our in-
fluence to recognize the rights of the
Chinese Government when these other
nations, would have, if left to themselves,
ignored all rights but the right of the
most powerful. We have strengthened
the hands of the mandarins and elevated{{< /news/text >}}

The last European Mail.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}By the arrival of the Siamese Steam-
er Chow Phya on the 17th inst, we
have received dates by telegram from
Europe to 12th May, and from U. S.
Am. to the middle of April.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At our latest dates the political re-
lations of Prussia and Austria were
unsettled as on a volcano's crater that
might any hour break out with the
most fearful eruptions. Italy had
made herself ready for a strong ad-
vance upon Venitia. Negotiations
were being made for a simultaneous
disarmament of the troops of Prussia
and Austria with some probability that
they would be successful. France
was still maintaining ostensibly the
most perfect reticence with regard to
all the belligerant movements of cen-
tral and southern Europe, and standing
afar off in regard to any aid she might
render in restoring peace. This, con-
sidering her relations to all those states,
and the power she is proud of know-
ing she has of turning the balances of
of those nations which way she will,
looks ominous. Prussia, it should
seem would not have ventured to have
done what she has, without the secret
sanction of Napoleon III, nor Italy to
take up arms against Austria without
a cue from the same Monarch.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rome is sitting on her seven hills
with spirits greatly perplexed. She
knows not but she may herself be in
a moment engulfed with His Serene
Holiness the Pope at her head. His
Holiness is thought to be looking out
anxiously for some hole or den of a
rock into which he can flee for safety.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the meantime a great commercial
crisis is coming over Europe and in-
deed has already been inaugurated.
Many large Houses in India are now
feeling the same commercial-quake.
Some have tumbled to ruins and many
others are reeling to and fro.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The terrible cholera threatens to
sweep over India, Europe, and America
this summer. We are glad to hear
from some quarters that it is anti-
cipated with great calmness, sobriety,
and cleanliness, which if universal would
almost annihilate the scourge.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The cattle plague, which threatened
to make all Englishmen as lean as
Pharaoh's famished kine, appears to
be rapidly declining. We hope and
trust that they, together with their
cousins on the western side of the At-
lantic, will have thoroughly learned by
this scourge that neither beef nor mut-
ton is the main staff of life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The political aspects of the U. S. are
still extremely exciting. The war be-
tween Liberty and Slavery has not yet
ended. We hope and trust that it
will not again take to swords, powder,
shot, and shell; still we regard it as
scarcely less exciting or less momen-
tous now than when those weapons
were the most fearfully employed. The
Civil Right's Bill, our readers will per-
ceive, has become a law of the land over
the President's veto. It seems to us a
most reasonable and righteous Bill,
securing as it does the full citizenship
of all persons born in the U. S. It was
mainly because the blacks were not
excepted in the Bill that it met with
the powerful opposition it did. It is
impossible to predict with accuracy
what will be the immediate results of
this great advance of the army of
Liberty. We feel sure that its ultimate
influences will be glorious; for Jehovah
himself is working out the great prin-
ciples of Liberty in the U. S. and we
believe will surely conduct her armies
into Canaan.{{< /news/text >}}

Petchaburee, No. 2
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As in our last we bid good night
to our readers at the Landing of the
Presbyterian Mission in Petchaburee,
we would now resume our narrative
from the Sea Bird the next morning.
Having heard, on our arrival late at
night, naught but good news from
our children and other friends at the
Mission, we retired to our berth on
board the boat, and enjoyed a night
of the most refreshing sleep, having
left the mosquitoe territory quite be-
hind us. We and our friends all awoke
early for mutual greetings, which were
full of gladness because of the good-
ness of our Heavenly Father to us
and ours, and to all the children of
men. The air of the morning was
cool and delightful. All the vegeta-
ble tribes and families were teeming
with life, and exerting themselves to
their utmost in their varied modes and
powers in praise of their Maker. Birds
to us of unusual note and of the most
beautiful plumage, were singing their
morning ditties. The bellowing of cows
and calves and the crewing of cocks
and cackling of hens carried us back
in the quickness of thought to our
boyhood days and filled us with the
pleasantest associations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Petchaburee Mission is situated
on the left or west bank of the beauti-
ful river of that name, about 15 miles
from its mouth, if measured by the
many bends of the river, and not more
than 8 miles by a straight course. The
Mission was commenced in June 1861,
by Rev. D. McGilvary, and Rev. S.
G. McFarland and their families, be-
ing a detachment from the Presbyte-
rian Mission in Bangkok. Its loca-
tion is peculiarly pleasant, situated a
little below the town, enjoying a good
degree of retirement from its din, tur-
moil, and corruption, and being next
neighbor above to one of the smallest
and consequently stillest of temples,
which is almost entirely concealed by
lovely clumps of bamboos, and the
grandest specimens of the poà tree,
the palmyra palm, the tamarind, the
mango, etc. In their rear is a little
forest of many kinds of trees all ever-
green, as most of the trees of Siam
are. Under its shade reside a few fa-
milies of priceless souls for whom
Christ died, and to whom he has sent
his servants. Adjoining the premises
on the upper side is the residence of
an officer of government, overshadow-
ed by bamboos and the magnificent
mango. In the front is a river of clear
water so pure and life giving that the
kings of Siam must have all their
drinking water taken from it. This river
is nearly full three months of the year,
overflows its banks three times for
many days together, and is for the rest
of the time generally shallow at that
place so as to be easily forded by foot-
men. It is just there remarkable for
running always the downward way,
and sometimes with great power. On
the bank opposite the Mission premi-
ses is another evergreen forest with
here and there a native dwelling.
Looking up the river on the west side
some 180 rods you will see five or
six brick buildings separated a little
from each other, built in European
style, neatly finished with white stucco
work, and each furnished with a front
fence and landing of the same mate-
rial. They are the country residences
of Siamese princes and lords. A lit-
tle above this you will see a beautiful
bridge crossing the river, which will
for the moment lead you to fancy that
you are at home in a christian land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Mission premises comprise
about an acre of land. Their two
dwelling houses of two stories are ra-
ther small, yet quite comfortable, and
becoming the simplicity and neatness
which should always characterize the
dwellings of the ambassadors of the
cross of Christ. One of them is of
brick with an earthen tiled roof; the
other of brick and wood thatched with
attap palm leaves. They are enclosed
by a fence common to them both.
The front part of it is strikingly uni-
que, having brick pillars instead of
wooden posts eight feet apart, and
the spaces occupied by a cheap and
tasty wooden paling. The pillars
are neatly finished with white stucco,
and contrast finely with the na-
tural wood color of the paling. As
the river was found to be cutting off
their front at a fearful rate, the bre-
thren, by the advice and aid of their
good friend the Lieutenant Governor,
made, last year, a firm brick dike, and
constructed a small breakwater a few
yards above it, by which means
their front has been saved and great-
ly improved, and made into a very
pleasant promenade ground, with a good
flight of steps down to the water, fur-
nished with comfortable seats at its
head for both an observatory and an
airy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We could not but admire the sim-
ple and neat arrangement of their
door yard with their white stucco
walks, some in large squares and some
in graceful curves and ovales. The
ground was tastefully occupied with
some of the most beautiful shrubbery
the country affords. One of them,
though not at all uncommon in Bang-
kok never seemed to us so perfectly
charming, and we cannot refrain from
discribing it. It is called in the Sia-
mese tongue tom-p'oot: but what bota-
nists would denominate it we have not
time now to search out. Cape Jessi-
mine is the name, we think, by which
the English know it. It is here a bush
growing to the height of from 6 to 8 feet,
generally with but one stem or stalk,
but sometimes with three or more.
Its main limbs branch off near the
ground, and extending upward with
the most pleasing crooks and curves
amplify in all the wildness and beauty
of nature, forming a most graceful top
from 10 to 16 feet in circumference
and remarkable for being rather flat
than otherwise. Their leaves are ovates
of small size, the longest being not
more than four inches in length, of
the richest green and highest polish.
Their flowers are the purest white
you ever saw, without stamens, and con-
sisting of from 15 to 20 petals charm-
ingly plated and ruffled. They al-
ways illustrate clearly to our mind the
purity and sweetness of heaven. The
disk of the corol is about the size of
a Mexican dollar. They are as deli-
cately fragrant as they are delicately
formed, being strikingly contrasted
in this respect with many of the flow-
ers of Siam which are too powerful
on the olfactory organs to be agree-
able. What adds peculiar interest to
these charming little bushes, is the
fact that they are perpetually in blos-
som. But now, since the rains have
began to fall, they are in their very
best estate. There are many hundreds
of full blossoms on each bush, and four
times that number of beautiful white
flower buds, all pointing directly hea-
venward, and contrasting finely with a
less number of deep green and shi-
ning leaves, ever looking directly up-
ward to catch every sun-beam and
every dew-drop their Maker may be
pleased to grant them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our own home rose, always the
queen among flowers, was also there,
though an exotic, imparting life and
loveliness to the place. And to crown
all, there stands in front of each house
within the fence a thrifty tamarind tree
to break the glare of the clear sky at
midday.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus our readers will see that the
Petchabaree Missionaries have a
charming place to live in, and to study
and preach the gospel to the heathen
about them. And we would hereby
bear them witness that they have
made a good beginning, and that they
seem intent in giving themselves
wholly to the work of the "ministry of
the Word." They have formed a lit-
tle church with a native membership
of three adults, one of whom is being
educated for the ministry, and is al-
ready employed as a good deal of his
time as a colporteur. Though it be in-
deed to them a day of small things in
one sense, it is a great day in the light
of eternity. Who shall estimate the
greatness of the salvation that has al-
ready been wrought in those three
souls if they have indeed trusted in
Christ! All the material wealth of
this world would be but as the small
dust of the balance when weighed
with it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is now, among a large part
of their charge, a lively interest mani-
fested in hearing the gospel, and we
may confidently look for a great
work of grace among them.{{< /news/text >}}

LOCAL.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Steamer "Chow Phya" arrived
here on the 17th inst having been
only 3 days and 10 hours on her pas-
sage from Singapore. By her we have
dates from London up to 26th April,
from America to 12th April, from
India to 17th May, from Hong Kong
to 30th May, and from Singapore to
9th June.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The British Schooner "Waterlily"
had arrived at Singapore before the
"Chow Phya" left for this port, and
had been ashore for 9 days on a sand
bank to the S. E. of Kallatin river.
She had to dispose of a part of her
cargo to pay the expenses of getting
off the sand bank.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Master Attendant of Singapore
informed Capt. Orton before sailing,
that 15 junks had recently cleared out
from that port for the Gulf of Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Rice Crop.—-Letters from Pet-
chaburee dated the 15th instant state,
that no rain of any consequence had
fallen there for many days, and that
the work of preparing for a new crop
of rice had been suspended. No part
of a new crop had then been planted,
which we suppose is the state of the
business in all parts of the land. Still
the people feel no alarm as regards
their next rice crop, because this year
there is an intercalary 8th month, and
the first 8th month, they say, is al-
ways too dry for planting rice. As in
their opinion the next 8th month is
the settled time for rice farming, and
as the Calendar gives them a double
8th month, because their reckoning
had got ahead of the true time 30 days,
they quietly wait for all that error to
be corrected. Then, if the rains hold
up, they will become alarmed. Yesterday
was the beginning of their 2nd and 8th
month and sure enough the rain came
down again powerfully, and the clouds
look as if they were prepared for a
wet time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}PIRACY.—-The last mail from Sin-
gapore brought us a report that a squad
of 15 small junks of very suspicious ap-
pearance, had been recently fitted out
in that port, with guns and ammunition
for a cruise in the gulf of Siam. It is
much to be feared that the expedition
will prove to be a piratical one. We
are credibly informed that the Siamese
government have taken alarm by this
report, and have determined to des-
patch H. S. M. G. B. Impregnable
for a cruise in the gulf to watch for
piratical craft.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}SNAKE BITE.-—We have just learn-
ed that a Laos man, an uncle of one
of our workmen, was bitten by a snake
while in his bed and died in a few
minutes. His bed was on the floor,
as all the poorer classes sleep, and had
mosquitoe bars suspended over it.
His wife was in another bed in the
same room and all the lights had been
extinguished. In the dead of night
the man cried out saying that a snake
had bitten him. His wife immediate-
ly arose and struck up a light, and went
to the bed of her husband and found
him dead.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is very singular that in a coun-
try where no less than 15 kinds of
venomous serpents are found, that we
rarely hear of a fatal snake-bite, and
more especially so, as none of the peo-
ple have any thing to shield their feet
and legs like shoes and boots.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}SYED HUSSIAN.-—a relative of the
Rajah of Kedda, has we learn recent-
ly arrived. He has become somewhat
famous as a disturber of the peace of
the Province of Wellesley, and has
been repeatedly arrested for his mis-
demeanors. Whether he has come
hither under arrest for trial at this
court as a Siamese subject, we are not
informed. Documents relative to the
course he has taken in Keddah and the
Province of Wellesley have just been
received by the Siamese government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}BOLDNESS AS EDITORS.—-One of the
most respectable and important native
officers connected with the commerce
of Siam, said to us yesterday in reply
to the question, what can we do to
increase the usefulness of our Siamese
Recorder, promptly said, “Fear no
man. Be bold in exposing all the evil
you see, and faithfully report in praise
of all the good.” We were struck with
the wisdom of the reply as it came
from the lips of a heathen. May the
Lord help us to follow this sage counsel{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}SHENANDOAH.—-We learn that the
American Consul has been officially
notified that the “Shenandoah,” an
American Man-of-war screw steamer
of 1400 tons, may be expected to visit
Siam in about a month. She is coming
to salute His Majesty and pay him the
best respects of the American govern-
ment, while at the same time she will
look after the welfare of all American
residents in the kingdom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This “Shenandoah” is no name
sake of the Anglo-Confederate pirate,
and has no sort of relation to her.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}MONS. AUBERET.—It is fully con-
firmed that Monsieur Aubaret is to be
here about the 1st August, and to re-
sume his official duties as Consul for
the French. We hope and trust that
he and all parties concerned in
his former administration have learn-
ed much practical wisdom during the
period of his absence, and that all the
wheels of the government, and consu-
late, and editorial department, in which
the three parties are united may be
kept well lubricated with the oil of
urbanity and faithfulness. As for our-
selves we are determined to exert our
utmost to this end, making no unne-
cessary allusions to the past that shall
be likely to stir up strife; and we trust
that M. Aubaret and the Siamese gov-
ernment will do the same. With
such views we are glad that he is to
return and hope to welcome him here
in the appointed time. We feel a deep
interest in the French expedition up
the Mei-song river in Cambodia, and
would with Mons. Aubaret and the
French government, put our shoulder,
feeble though it be, to the wheel of
pushing it onward and giving it every
success.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}GAZETTE DE MIDI states that a new

{{< news/text >}}torpedo of more destructive kind than any
hitherto invented has just been tried in
the dockyard of Castignean, Toulon, with
complete success. The VAUBAN ship-of-

water and instantly sunk in consequence
of an enormous hole in her keel caused

LETTER OF THE QUEEN TO MR. PEABODY.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following graceful letter has
been written by her Majesty to Mr.
Peabody:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Windsor Castle, March 28, 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Queen hears that Mr. Peabody
intends shortly to return to America,
and she would be sorry that he should
leave England without being assured
by herself, how deeply she appreciates
the noble act of more than princely
munificence by which he has sought
to relieve the wants of the poorer class
of her subjects residing in London.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is an act, as the Queen believes,
wholly without parallel, and which
will carry its best reward in the con-
sciousness of having contributed so
largely to the assistance of those who
can little help themselves.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Queen would not, however,
have been satisfied without giving Mr.
Peabody some public mark of her
sense of his munificence; and she
would gladly have conferred upon
him either a baronetcy or the Grand
Cross of the Order of the Bath, but
that she understands Mr. Peabody to
feel himself debarred from accepting
such distinctions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It only remains, therefore, for the
Queen to give Mr. Peabody this assu-
rance of her personal feelings, which
she would further wish to mark by
asking him to accept a miniature por-
trait of herself, which she will desire
to have painted for him, and which,
when finished, can either be sent to
him to America or given to him on
the return, which she rejoices to hear,
he meditates, to the country that owes
him so much.{{< /news/text >}}

Mr. PEABODY'S REPLY TO THE QUEEN.

gracious letter to Mr. Peabody:—-{{< /news/text >}}

The Palace Hotel, Buckingham-gate,
London, April 3d.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Madame,—-I feel sensibly my ina-
bility to express in adequate terms the
gratification with which I have read
the letter which your Majesty has done
me the high honor of transmitting
by the hands of Earl Russell.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the occasion, which has attracted
your Majesty's attention, of setting
apart a portion of my property to
ameliorate the condition and augment
the comforts of the poor of London,
I have been actuated by a deep sense
of gratitude to God, who has blessed
me with prosperity, and of attachment
to this great country, where, under
your Majesty's benign rule, I have
received so much personal kindness
and enjoyed so many years of hap-
piness{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next to the approval of my own
conscience, I shall always prize the
assurance which your Majesty's letter
conveys to me of the approbation of
the Queen of England, whose whole
life has attested that her exalted station
has in no degree diminished her sym-
pathy with the humblest of her sub-
jects.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The portrait which your Majesty is
graciously pleased to bestow on me, I
shall value as the most precious heir-
loom that I can leave in the land of
my birth, where, together with the
letter which your Majesty has ad-
dressed to me, it will ever be regarded
as an evidence of the kindly feeling of
the Queen of the United Kingdom
toward a citizen of the United States.{{< /news/text >}}

LORD RUSSELL.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whatever Lord Russell's faults, of all
statesmen of our own day, he has ever
shown the most deep and ingrained sym-
pathy with popular freedom. In this
respect neither Lord Palmerston nor Mr.
Gladstone, nor any other of our states-
men, can really approach him. Mr.
Gladstone is more tender and humane,
has a far deeper horror of popular suffer-
ing, and therefore of war, than Lord
Russell; for Lord Russell's sympathy
with freedom, like all true sympathy with
freedom, has something a little sharp and
stern about it—a little of the old Puritan
carelessness whether it be happy or un-
happy freedom. Perhaps the greatest
real defect in Lord Russell's political
character is that profound appreciation of
the value of his own services which has so
often led him into acts of disloyalty and
semi-treachery to his party and closest
political friends. Yet, in spite of this
grave deficiency, he has unquestionably
earned more from this generation than
any living statesman. He has carried the
Constitution triumphantly through its
greatest crisis, and rendered it as dear to,
as it was once hateful to the English mid-
dle class. He has forced the principle of
religious toleration in its widest bearings
on the Legislature. He has always re-
sisted sacerdotal tyranny, though some-
times with the heated anger of a mob,
rather than the wisdom of a statesman.
And he has kept England through many a
great crisis true to the cause of freedom
on both sides of the Atlantic, in America,
in France, in Spain, in Italy, and, in a
futile and helpless way, also in Poland
and Denmark, and sometimes when scarce-
ly any other man but himself would have
had the courage to say what he said, or to
resist the tide of feeling as he resisted it.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Mr. GLADSTONE.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are three cardinal facts which
need to be remembered in estimating Mr.
Gladstone's powers and difficulties as a
statesman. He is a Lancashire man, an
Oxford thinker, a Peelite politician. In
some respects all these influences have
worked differently, and in some, still more
important perhaps, they have cooperated.
In Lancashire he learnt that profound
appreciation of the might and right of
capital without which probably no creative
financier can be made. It was the blood
of the Lancashire spinner in the late Sir
Robert Peel, that made him, in spite of
his protective prejudices, the first great
modern reformer of our finance,—-the man
who taught far more liberal theorists how
to multiply the resources and economize
the expenditure of the State. Similarly,
it was the business element, combining
with great natural powers, in the late M.
James Wilson which gave fertility and
tension to his financial conceptions, and
made them greatly superior in practical
originality to those of the only consider-
able Whig financier the country has re-
cently produced—-Sir G. Cornwall Lewis.
The Lancashire feeling for capital is
strong in Mr. Gladstone. These are the
influences which seem to us to have made
Mr. Gladstone what he is—a statesman
of the very highest class of the second
rank—-or, as some one epigrammatically
said of him, "a statesman of second-rate
intellect in a first-rate state of efferves-
cence," a statesman on whom we could
scarcely rely to direct our policy in mo-
ments of difficulty, or to sway alone the
true mind of Parliament ; but yet a states-
man of far greater power than those who
would be competent to guide and lead
him—-a statesman of wonderful resource
on all subjects, of fine insight on many—-
but not a statesman of deeply-matured
political principles, nor one of the safest
judgments.—-FRIEND of INDIA.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A Frontier Expedition and
a new Sanitarium.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Pakchan river, in about 10° 50'
north latitude, it is the extreme southern
boundary in Burmah of our Eastern Em-
pire. To prevent disputes and punish
dacoits, it has long been wished by both
the Siamese and the English Governments
that landmarks should be laid down along
the watershed of the hills which run al-
most due north between the sources of
the Pakchan and the Thoungyeng rivers.
For this purpose the late Mr. O'Riley and
Lieutenant Bagge R. E. were appointed
commissioners for Her Britannic Majesty
to meet commissioners from the King of
Siam. The former were instructed not
to adhere strictly to the watershed line if
that involved any thing inequitable, or
even concessions which the Siamese had a
difficulty in admitting. At the same time,
on territory [...] be really ours, our
subjects were [..] to be exposed to undue
influence on the part of the Siamese, and
they were to be promised exemption from
taxation, the establishment of English
influence being much more important
than revenue. The range of hills which
forms the boundary is described as a long
line of mural limestone from 500 to 1000
feet above the plain, which stretches a
way to the sea for from eighty to forty
miles from Maulmain south to the Pak-
chan, not unlike the Concan of Bombay.
Starting from Maulmain the Commis-
sioners met those from the king of Siam
in the beginning of February 1865, on
the left bank of the Attaran. There a
shed was erected in the centre of our
camp, the Union Jack floated in the
breeze, a guard of honour presented arms,
and in this "Jungle council hall" the
three Siamese were received with the
dignity due to them, for one was the son
of a former prime minister and had been
in England, another was a chief of the
Talains and the third a chief of the
Karens. They were presented with the
rich rugs on which they sat, and after
having come to a general understanding,
the last alone was left to accompany our
officers in their toilsome duty, the two
former being on a mission from the king
to the great pagoda of Rangoon.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was no easy matter to find the true
watershed line in an unexplored country
which seems to consist of a confused mass
of elevations and depressions like so many
caterpillars. Marching up low hills co-
vered with jungle, and down again, pene-
trating forests filled with malaria, except
where else the pines sent forth a refreshing
odour, tracing the course of rivers whose
limestone boulders and virgin cascades
make them as beautiful as they are un-
navigable, and that in a tropical country,
is no easy task. At last after five days
search, from the top of Engding-toung,
a well-known rock 1900 feet above the
sea, Mr. O’Riley and Lieutenant Bagge
obtained such a view of the surrounding
country as enabled them to map the ser-
ried peaks in regular order according to
the ordinary laws of upheaval. On one
side and the other the telescope showed
the streams flowing down the Yomarange,
and after that, the work was simple though
most laborious. All along the watershed
was followed up and its more prominent
peaks dotted with cairns, till it began to
trend south-east into Siam. There, as
the Siamese have always claimed both
sides of the line as their territory, our
commissioners thought it right to surren-
der no less than 296 square miles. The
highest hill reached in the course of the
survey was Moolayit. This is a gigantic
mass of granite 6,300 feet above the sea
and accessible only on the northern side.
On its two distant peaks, like Parismoth,
stand two pagodas, each of which boasts
a hair of Gautama’s beard. Their found-
ers, according to a very common Bud-
dhist legend, were holy dervishes, who
agreed to burn fires every night to assure
each other of their existence. The Ta-
lains believe that one of them still lives.
Lieutenant Bagge dilates on the advan-
tages of this hill as a sanitarium for all
Burmah. It seems to be superior even
to Simla for it has abundance of space
and material for building, good water is
plentiful, the wild Rhododendron de-
corates its sides, the road requires but
few alterations and the summit is only
seventeen miles from the Houndraw river
which is navigable from Maulmain by
boats at all seasons. Population alone is
scanty, but that will doubtless be attract-
ed by the time the good people of Maul-
main begin to spend the hot seasons on
the top of Moolayit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the well-known landmark of the
Three Pagodas the boundary northwards
was lined off with cairns for 99 miles to
the source of the Thongyeng river. The
boundary running south to the Pakchan
has been demarcated this season and is
not yet reported on. But one sad inci-
dent has marred the success of this in-
teresting expedition. M. O’Riley died
from its effects. He was an honour to
the Uncovenanted service. None knew
the mountain tribes of Burmah so well as
he; none used his influence with them for
such benevolent purposes. Lieutenant
Bagge’s remarks on the career and char-
acter of “the good old man” are within
the truth, when he describes him as un-
selfish and kind-hearted, as possessing an
amount of perseverance and energy un-
equalled by men of his age and physical
capacity, and as exhibiting in discussions
with the Siamese a rare combination of
firmness and patience, political experience
and tact. Before Colonel Phayre leaves
British Burmah for a time, at the close
of the year, we trust he will be able to
visit Moolayit and report upon its advan-
tages.—-FRIEND of INDIA.{{< /news/text >}}

Pulpit Entertainment
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not satisfied with concert and opera,
circus, and play-house, and dance, there
is a growing disposition to push the de-
mand for entertainment up into the
realm of serious things ; to require that
lectures shall be entertaining rather than
instructing, a paraphrase of Punch and
Judy, adapted to people of literary pre-
tensions, rather than an earnest, serious
discussion of important themes ; to make
the church service a religious entertain-
ment, composed of opera music and sen-
sational preaching. Hundreds of people
prefer an anecdote to an argument, a fine
voice to a fine thought, a flourish of the
hand to any exercise of imagination or of
faith on the preacher's part. The most
popular preacher in America owes most
of his success to the fact that, an actor
by nature, by accident of birth and train-
ing, he has dropped into the pulpit in-
stead of being put upon the “boards;”
and he has transformed his pulpit into a
stage, where he outdoes both Forrest and
Booth by the inimitable charm and pow-
er of his acting. His preaching undoubt-
edly does immense good ; but his acting
increases the volume and intensity of the
popular desire for entertainment, which
threatens to sweep away everything pre-
cious and sacred.—-CHRISTIAN ENQUIRER.{{< /news/text >}}

The Feeling at the South
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We could fill up every column of our
paper with reliable reports of the disloy-
alty and oppression of the negro which
prevail throughout the South. There are
exceptional sections, but hatred of the
Union, persecution of loyal men and
outrages upon the freedmen are told of
all the States, until the heart is sick of
bearing. To make the testimony com-
plete, and beyond all cavil, the Congres-
sional Reconstruction Committee publish
the evidence gathered by them. The
witnesses called include the claimants to
seats in Congress, the Officers in the
Union army, even leading rebels, repre-
sentatives of all classes and of all senti-
ments. Most significant is the fact that
not a single trustworthy witness yet re-
ported, believes it will be safe to with-
draw the Union troops, to discontinue
the Freedmen's Bureau, or to forbid the
suspension of the writ of HABEAS CORPUS.{{< /news/text >}}

The Cholera.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}(18th.) Sir J. C. JERVOISE (Hants, L.)
asked the Vice-President of the Commit-
tee of Council on Education whether the
attention of the medical officers of the
Privy Council had been directed to a
statement in the MORNING STAR of the
25th of October, 1863, that the Emperor
and Empress of the French had visited
the cholera hospitals in Paris, and that M.
Gustave Girard had made experiments in
demonstration of the non-infectious na-
ture of the cholera.-—Mr. BRUCE replied
that the medical officer of the Privy
Council was cognizant of the conduct of
the illustrious personages in question,
whose courage and humanity on that oc-
casion had excited such general admira-
tion. (Hear, hear.) He was also aware
of the daring experiments made by M.
Girard, who had placed upon his own
tongue the moisture from the brow and
the fur from the tongue of a man who
had died of cholera. But, in the first
place, such an experiment only proved
the insusceptibility to that disease of M.
Girard, and by no means proved that the
experiment might be tried with equal
safety by other persons. Even if held
conclusive on that point, it did not in the
slightest measure invalidate the position
taken by the medical officer of the Privy
Council with respect to the infectiousness
of that disease. The hon. baronet had,
moreover, overlooked the fact that, as the
French Government was at present
strongly advocating quarantine precau-
tions against cholera in the East, it might
be presumed that their medical advisers
entertained the same opinion as the med-
ical advisers of the English Government
on the subject of M. Girard's experi-
ments.{{< /news/text >}}

American Revenue.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The American Revenue Commissioners
have reported to the President in support
of their recommendation of a tax of 2½d.
on cotton after 1st July next, to be col-
lected of the manufacturer at the place
of consumption, and of the merchant or
factor at the port of export upon all
foreign shipments? that it will yield a
revenue, at 22 dols. per bale, of 22,000,
000 dols. for every million sold. Govern-
ment might derive an annual revenue of
88,000,000 dols. on a crop of 4,000,000
of bales, which would be less than the
crop of 1859-60. Of this sum—-if the
consumption of the United States shall
reach that of 1860—-the inhabitants of
the United States would pay about 21,
000,000 dols, and it is believed there are
few taxes which can be levied which
would be so slight a burden to the con-
sumer. The consumption of cotton per
head in the United States, at the highest
point ever attained has not exceeded 12
pounds. A tax of 5 cents per pound
would therefore be an average of about
60 cents to each individual per annum.
As the crop of the present year is not
likely to be less than 2,000,000 of bales—-
and if good seed can be obtained may
exceed this figure-—the Commission are
of opinion that the government may safe-
ly rely for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1867, upon a revenue from this source of
at least 40,000,000 dols.—-MAULMAIN

Pinjrapole.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}—There is a Pinjrapole, or hospital
for animals, in Bombay. When, in 1832
an Act was passed for the destruction of
vagrant dogs, the late Sir Jimsetjee Je-
jeebhoy and several Hindoon and Parsees
subscribed £ 22,500 wherewith they pur-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}chased several acres of land, with build-
ings, in the Bholeshwar Road for the re-
ception of the doomed animals. Soon
bullocks and horses were admitted, and
now there are specimens of almost every
class. The municipality very properly
taxes the horses. A writer in the Bom-
BAY GAZETTE describes a visit which he
paid to the Pinjrapole. Some of the ani-
mals are sleek, and others have enormous
wens and sores. In what may be called
the sick and dying wards are cows and buf-
faloes in the last stage of disease, lingering
out a miserable existence. Most of them
were lying on the ground, and the ap-
pearance of many was truly pitiable.
There were hundreds of dogs which come
in at the rate of about 50 a day, from 8
annas to 1 rupee being paid for each.
There are also several monkeys, cats,
sheep, ducks, deer and even turtle. The
ants receive a daily ration of sugar and
ghee, and boys are paid to collect the
black beetles at feeding time.
The writer mentions it only as a rumour that, to
provide for insects unmentionable, a full-
blooded cooly used to be strapped to a
cot where they abounded, in such a way
that he could not injure them.
The animals are really cared for at a cost of Rs.
1,000 a month. There are smaller pla-
ces of the same kind in Bombay, Guzerat
and the Decean.{{< /news/text >}}

A Connubial Sermon.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Wife and mother, are you tried and
out of patience with your husband's and
your children's demands upon your time
and attention? Are you tempted to
speak out angry feelings to that faithful,
but perhaps some times heedless or
exacting husband of yours? or to scold
and fret at these sweet and beautiful
ones? Do you groan and say,—-"what a
fool I was to marry and leave my father's
house, where I lived in ease and quie-
tude?" Are you by reason of care
and weariness of body which wifehood
and motherhood must bring, forgetful of,
and unmindful for their comforts and
their joys? Oh, wife and mother, what
if a stroke should smite your husband
and lay him low? What if your chil-
dren should be snatched from your arms,
and from your bosom? What if there
were no soft little innocents to nestle in
your arms, and to love you, or receive
your love? How would it be with you
then? Be patient and kind, dear wife;
be unwearying and long-suffering, dear
mother, for you know not how long you
may have with you your best and dearest
treasures—-you know not how long you
may tarry with them. Let there be noth-
ing for you to remember which will wring
your heart with remorse if they leave you
alone; let there be nothing for them to re-
member but sweetness and love unutters-
ble, if you are called to leave them by the
way. Be patient, be pitiful, be tender of
them all; for death will step sooner or later
between them and you. And oh! what
would you do, if you should be doomed
to sit solitary and forsaken through years
and years? Be happy as you are, even
with all your trials; for believe it, thou
wife of a true and loving husband, there
is no lot in life so blessed as thine own.{{< /news/text >}}

An Interesting Fact.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is well known to what prodigious
sums money improved for some time at
compound interest will increase. A penny,
so improved from our Saviour's birth as to
double itself every fourteen years, or which
is nearly the same, put out at five per
cent, compound interest, at our Saviour's
birth, would by this time have increased
to more money than would be contained
in one hundred and fifty millions of globes,
each equal to the earth in magnitude, and
all solid gold. A shilling put out at six per
cent, compound interest, would in the
same time have increased to a greater sum
in gold than the whole solar system could
hold, supposing a sphere equal in diameter
to of Saturn's orbit. And the earth is to such
a sphere as a half square foot, or a quarto
page to the whole surface of the earth.{{< /news/text >}}

Riding a Hobby.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Archbishop of Dublin tells of a
horseman, who, having lost his way, made
a complete circle; when the first round
was finished, seeing the marks of a horse's
hoofs, and never dreaming that they were
those of his own beast, he rejoiced, and
said, "This at least, shows me that I am
in some track?" When the second circuit
was finished, the signs of travel were dou-
bled, and he said, "Now, surely, I am in
a beaten track;" and with the conclusion
of every round, the marks increased, till
he was certain that he must be in some
frequented thoroughfare, and approach-
ing a populous town; but all the while
was riding after his horse's tail, and de-
ceived by the track of his own error. So
it is with men that ride a hobby.{{< /news/text >}}

armed and officered the Chinese forces,
at the risk of these forces being turned
against ourselves. We have put money
into the Chinese Treasury by mulcting
our own subjects for their benefit. It
was the moral influence of England that
enabled the custom officers to gather in
their levies. It is English influence that
even now enables the Chinese Govern-
ment to enforce the observance of their
customs, laws, and tariff rules.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Much has been done, but much still
remains to do; China must, however help
herself hereafter a little more readily and
a little more energetically than she has
hitherto done. We have, taken her out
of the ruts and placed her on the level
road. We have metaphorically speak-
ing, played the part of the good Samari-

{{< news/text >}}Will the Chinese Government take

a change of dynasty take place before

of foreign for native rulers.{{< /news/text >}}

or people in the way of our free ingress
or egress through the country, to the in-
troduction of railroads, telegraphs, and
other improvements of modern civiliza-
tion in the way of trade, commerce, and
scientific enquiry is an additional motive
for urging England to do what she would
rather not do, i. e. make herself the arbi-
ter and ruler of China, as she has be-
come the sovereign mistress of India,
spite of repeated and sincerely uttered
protest of her unwillingness to do so.

Mail Steamers.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Amongst the latest files of San Fran-
cisco papers we notice a description of
the steamers which are building in New
York, for the new line between San
Francisco and Hongkong. When comple-
ted they will be the largest merchant ships
ever constructed in the United States,
and most probably the largest wooden
ships in the world. Two of these gigan-
tic steamers are now in course of con-
struction at New York, and they will be
ready to take up the mail service, on the
1st January 1867. The dimensions and
tonnage of these leviathans is something
enormous ; their beam is to be 50 feet,
they will each have three docks, and will
be built with four water tight compart-
ments ; their tonnage will be 5,000 tons
and their cost will be over a million of
dollars each. They will be fitted with
beam engines, with all the latest Ameri-
can improvements to this form of steam-
ship machinery. These splendid passenger
ships will have accommodation for 500 first
class passengers, and will make the round
voyage, from San Francisco to Hongkong
and back, via Kanagawa, in two months.
We presume that deducting for stop-
pages, the trip from here to San Francis-
co will be accomplished in about 3 weeks ;
the average passage by sailing ship being
about sixty or sixty-five days. If the
arrangements on board for passengers is
conducted a little more in accordance
with English ideas of comfort than the
American boarding house style of rush-
ing to meals like wild animals, which
rather astonishes the uninitiated British-
er on the great American lines of steam-
ers, the line may be used by many going
to Europe, in preference to the overland
route.—-STRAITS TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

force of old tradition, the nominal equal
of the Tycoon. He can, indeed, well af-

Money Market
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}More serious and unexpected intelli-
gence than that brought by the telegrams
of the 10th and 11th instant never reach-
ed India-—an unparalleled panic in the
money market, a bank like Overend Gur-
ney's stopped; several more likely to fol-
low, all in distress, and the Government
expresssing their willingness to violate the
Bank Act or 1844 a third time. This
action of Government may, and probably
will, have the same effect as a similar in-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}timation in 1847—-that of restoring con-
fidence at once. In 1857 the Act was
suspended on 12th November but not
for more than nine days after was the fe-
ver excitement allayed. The Act was in
reality broken by over-issues, but the dif-
ficulty was not of long duration. So
far as the telegrams show the panic has
been caused by the expectation of war
between Austria and Prussia. On the
7th it was considered inevitable, but on
the 11th, the latest date, it had evidently
not been declared. Nothing could be
more ominous than the suspension of
specie payments in Austria, the attempt
of Italy to raise a loan to help her to
take the Quadrilateral and Venetia, and
the appeal of Saxony against the designs
of Prussia to the Diet. Still war cannot
be the only cause. England will keep
out of the struggle, and former experi-
ence has shown that when the Continent
is disturbed capital is sent to England for
security. At the end of March the
ECONOMIST declared that in the previous
quarter the Bank of England had “ma-
naged admirably.” The real source of
the evil is doubtless to be found in those,
numberless finance companies which, in
London and Paris as in India, conceal
the nature of the securities that they
hold. Nothing can now prevent the out-
burst of that volcano on which Bombay
has been slumbering. Already two firms
have gone, and one of them is the very
first in the second rank. We have rea-
son to be grateful that Calcutta is likely
to bear the strain. There is not excite-
ment so much as a total suspension of
trade that is certain. The absence of
news later than the 11th is almost worse
than intelligence of further commercial
disasters.—-FRIEND OF INDIA.{{< /news/text >}}

of a probable dissolution of some of the
