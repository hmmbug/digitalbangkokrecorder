Bangkok 1st Dec. 1865.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Siamese doubtless oftentimes think,
that we farangs are unnecessarily severe
upon them, and at the same time are med-
dling with those things which don't concern
us, when we blame them for not at once a-
waking up to the importance, of taking
hold of those vast internal improvements
which render a country great and powerful.
Perhaps it is to some extent true. The pa-
pers have told them again and again of rail-
roads, canals, and telegraphs, of furnaces,
forges, and rolling mills, of improved agri-
cultural implements, of institutions of learn-
ing, observatories &c. of big guns and iron
clads; of the oil business and the vast for-
tunes derived from it, in short they have
told them of every thing which constitutes
the wealth, and superiority of western na-
tions. Those too who consider themselves
better capable of advising than the news-
papers, have also privately urged upon
them the necessity of securing at once a
good financier for the government, and of
appointing an international judge. But to
all these importunities they apparently
turn a deaf ear, and sleep away. But are
they really doing nothing? Are they mak-
ing no progress! They, it is true, move so
slowly that foreigners can scarcely see them
moving at all. If we take a retrospect of the
last four or five years, we can see that they
have not, at least, been retrograding, and
should get credit for what they have done.
Five years ago there was scarcely any thing
in the kingdom which could be called a road.
Europeans talked much and long upon the
subject until at length a move was made, and
the result is a road which is certainly a credit
to the country. Although it lingered long
without being finished, and is still in many
places in an unfinished state, and needs
many things to make it what it should be,
still it affords a vast amount of real enjoy-
ment, and equestrian exercise to many of
the European community. But is it really
no benefit to the Siamese themselves! It
needs but a stroll along it almost any day,
to prove that all classes, at least, enjoy it.
It also enhances very much the value of
property, in its vicinity. Places which
could formerly be bought in the same neigh-
borhood very low, now command large
prices. But it has also the draw backs. I
affords situations for the establishing of dens
of iniquity and haunts for thieves. Theiv-
ing and open violence were never so pre-
valent as since the opening of that road.
These things however may be expected
and ought be provided against.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The new canal which is now making will
also be a great benefit to the country. It
will open up agriculture a large region
which has hitherto been comparatively use-
less.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But whilst we have these evidences that
there is really somthing doing, still like
Oliver Twist, we want more. There are
we believe several more canals in contemp-
plation, which when completed will open up
up a vast region of country between this and
the Old City, which is now comparatively
useless. After all, too, canals are the things
for Siam. In a country like this, which
during a certain portion of the year, is al-
most wholly overcrowded, the best of roads
would be useless during that time. The
principle transportation too of produce, &c.
must be done in boats. Canals also open up
the country better to agricultural purposes
than roads. Some more roads are however
needed. One is needed on the wast side
of the river, to correspond to the one on the
east side. It should intersect the new road
in contemplation to Na-Kawn-Choi-See,
passing down and intersecting the river op-
posite where the other one does. It would
greatly enhance the value of property on that
side of the river. Some enterprising natives
too could also drive a pretty good business
by establishing a ferry at the place where the
roads intersect the river, and at several oth-
er places higher up. The ferry boats should
be of such dimensions, that they could carry
over at any time in safety horses and car-
riages. It may be argued however that the
government is not able to do it. If not
let it be given out, like the present canal, to
individual enterprise, with the privilege of
taking toll from all passing until it is paid.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Every horseman can pay two or three Ats,
and every footman an At without feeling it.
Foreigners will prefer to pay by the year.
This would be an easy and honorable way
to have the work done.{{< /news/text >}}

How I won my wife.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Jessie Hale was the merriest, prettiest and
most provoking daughter of Eve that ever
existed—-at least, I thought so, though, per-
haps, I was not an impartial judge, and I must
confess I was deeply in love, and, in fact. I
don't believe I could remember of a time
when I was not in love with her. It certainly
was not when, a youngster of twelve, I took
her under my especial care, feeling prouder
than of my curly-headed charge than I could
now of a mine of gold; for when, a tall,
awkward boy of sixteen, I first ventured to
ask for her company home from church; nor,
still later, when, after four years' absence, I
returned to my native town, and set up as a
surgeon in the house where Dr. Moore's name
had been since my earliest recollections.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Oak place was a remarkably healthy place,
or else the good people felt a little afraid of
trusting their lives in the hands of such a
young scapegrace as they had known me to
be, for my horse and gig found more employ-
ment in carrying Jessie Hale to ride them in
any more profitable business; and it is certain
more of my time was spent in Mr. Hale's
pleasant parlor than in either the study or
practice of medicine. Some of the neigh-
bors slyly remarked that I must have a very
sick patient there to occasion such frequent
visits; and I am certain that if I had no pa-
tient there, all the patience I ever had was
required there at all; for of all the tanta-
lizing little wretches that ever fascinated a
poor fellow—he could not have told
whether he was in the body or out of it—-
Jessie Hale was the worst.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}And there was I-—William Tremaine-—
spending six feet two in my stockings, big
enough to have known better, that is sure,
loaded about by that little elf, coming and go-
ing at every beck and call, as if I were a
great simpleton; as in truth I mean have
been, for after playing "yearn, must devot-
edly" for six months, I was no nearer win-
ning them at first. Open-handed and can-
did she was on every other subject; but just
let me speak of love or marriage, and I might
well talk to a stone wall for all the sense
I could get from her. No matter how
cautiously I might approach the subject, she
was always ready with some off-hand answer,
as from which I wanted as the equator
from the poles, until I was almost in despair,
but more eager after every failure. All is
fair in love and war; or at least I thought so,
and resolved to try the result of strategy on
my wilful little lady love.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One fine morning, as we were about start-
ing for a ride on horseback, as I was assist-
ing Jessie into the saddle, her horse coun-
menced rearing and kicking at an alarming
rate-—of course, the jagged bits of iron that
I had cautiously inserted beneath the saddle
had nothing to do with it. By the time
she was fairly seated the horse had become
perfectly unmanageable, throwing her viol-
ently from the saddle. Of course, I caught
her before she reached the ground. No
sooner was she in safety than, with a deep
groan, I staggered back against the fence,
my right arm hanging helplessly by my side.
It took nicely, for Jessie was beside me in
a moment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Oh! I Will," she said, pitiously, "that
terrible horse has broken your arm; and
what will you do? Poor Will! poor Will!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How like a rascal I felt at sight of her
distress; but I was not going to give up
then, so I answered, with another terrible
groan—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"It is nothing, dear Jessie. I would suf-
fer a thousand times more to feel that I have
saved your precious life."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"But oh! I am so sorry. What can be
done for you?" she said with such touching
accent that I half repented.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The end justifies the means," I thought.
The end accomplished certainly did. My
answer was in a low, faint voice, as if I were
dying.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Only tell me that you love me, Jessie
darling. It will soothe my pain more than
anything else in the world."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And then, like the great simpleton that
I was, I put that right arm around her, and
never discovered my mistake until she
sprang suddenly away from me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Wouldn't a little brandy and water do
as well, Mr. Tremaine?" she said, archly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Wouldn't I have sold myself for a six-
pence? But there was no help for it; so I
had to own the trick, and went home wish-
ing I had broke my arm, or neck, I did not
care much which.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After that, for a while, I was rather shy of
the love subject, for I did not fancy hear-
ing of my last attempt; but my heart was
so full of love for Jessie Hale that I could
not force my tongue to keep silence very
long. So, on one morning, after lounging in
my study and when I was tired of everything—
myself in particular—-I went over the way,
resolved that the matter should be decided
before I returned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Jessie was sitting by the parlor window,
busily sewing, and humming some merry
tune to herself when I entered. She was
looking prettier than ever, I thought, and I
found it verily hard to talk on common
place subjects when my life was so full of
the one so important to me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At last I broke in upon some of her care-
less nonsense with,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Why, in the world, Jessie, don't you
say whether you love me or not! What is
the use of keeping a fellow in suspense for-
ever? I believe you do—-in fact, I know
you do."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Here I was again making a simpleton of
myself. I might have known she never
would have told me after that, but I did
not understand womankind as well then as
I have done since.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Oh! you do know, then, do you?" she
said, coolly, with a merry twinkle in her
eye. "Then, of course, there is no need of
my telling you."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"No, I did not mean it, Jessie," I said,
penitently. "But do you love me? Will
you answer me, yes or no?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Yes or no," she answered, demurely.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Oh! Jessie Hale," I impatiently ex-
claimed, "you will drive me crazy."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"A terrible misconception, surely," she said,
with a laugh, throwing dow???? work and
stepping through the low window upon the
lawn. "Now, Will, I will tell you what I
will do if you promise never to plague
me again about this."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I will tell you what I will do if you
will only give me an honest answer," I eagerly
said.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Well, then, if you can catch me before
I reach the elm tree, I will give you a can-
did answer, upon my honor."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I thumped my head against the window
sash, and away I went over the green sward
with ten times more eagerness than I ever
displayed in playing catch in my boyhood
days. A very dignified proceeding truly,
for a staid surgeon. All the gossips in
Oakplace would have held up their hands
in pious horror had they seen me then; but
I did not care half the world saw me, no
intent was I on catching that flying gipsy
and catch her I did, before she was half{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Now, for the answer," I said eagerly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Oh! but can't you wait until I get my
breath?" drawing it in quick, spasmodic
jerks, like some dilapidated steam engine.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Let me see—what was it I promised to
tell you?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Whether you love me or not, you pro-
voking little wretch!" I said, fairly out of
patience.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Now, look here, Mr. Will—if you don't
leave off calling me names, I won't tell you
at all, though, perhaps, that is love talk, is
it? Will, I promised, you say?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Of course, you did; so, don't be all day
about it."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"If you hurry me, I can't speak at all,
for it will take me some time to think over
the objects of my love to see if you are a-
mong them. Let me see," beginning to
count her fingers, "there is Chloe, that's
one; and Prince—though he hurt your arm,
you know—is two; and old Brindle is three;
Watch is four, and—let me see—yes, there
is Mr. William Tremaine is five."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I do not think I stopped to thank her
for that answer; and if my return to the
parlor was not as rapid as my exit, it was
certainly more dignified. I had taken my
hat, and was out of the gate before Jessie
had reached the house.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I went home in no very enviable state of
mind, resolving that I never would go near
her again. But by the time I had reached
my study, my anger cooled considerably,
and I sat down in my arm-chair and began
to think of a plan, just as I had done a hun-
dred times before; I could outwit this
provoking little elf. Have her I would;
but how? That was the question.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"A letter for you, sir," cried out a boy
at the door.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I took the letter and tore it open: I was
too much occupied with my thoughts to
care much what its contents were; but the
first few lines fixd my attention. It was
from an uncle of mine, a surgeon in a flour-
ishing city, making me a very advantageous
offer if I would come and take his place.
This was just the situation I had been
watching for years, and I hailed it with de-
light now.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"But Jessie," I thought, "could I leave
her!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A moment's reflection showed me what
was needed, for she really cared for me,
my absence would make her willing to
acknowledge it. It did not take long to
make my arrangements, and before night
they were all completed. The next mor-
ning I started for the station, calling at Mrs.
Hale's on my way to bid Jessie good bye.
I could see the little witch did not believe
one word of the story I told her.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I hope, Mrs. Will, you won't break your
arm in the train; it would make it so bad
for you, she said, with a queer smile, as I
concluded.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"And you not there to cure it" I retort-
ed. " But, seriously, Jessie, I am in earn-
est now. It is probable I shall not see you
again for years, and if I like the place I shall
remain there."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She still believed it some trick, for her
eyes said plainly—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"You can't cheat me again."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And she said good bye as coolly as if it
were only for a day. I went down the walk
feeling much as I think Adam must have
felt when he left Paradise, although his Eve
went with him, and I left mine behind.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I was well pleased with the place, and
was not long in accepting my uncle's pro-
posal. I wrote to this effect to a lawyer,
desiring him to dispose of my property at
Oakplace. I knew Jessie would hear of it,
and it would give her to understand that I
had no intention of returning, determined
that if I did not succeed this time I would
give her up forever, though my heart gave
a quick throb of pain at the thought.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was just at twilight of a pleasant Sep-
tember day when I reached Oakplace. Dir-
ert to Mr. Hale's I took my way, saying
over to myself as I went, "Now or never."
Straight up to the gravel walk and across
the broad lawn I went, and into the
dusky parlor, unannounced. By the dim
light, I saw Jessie sitting on a sofa, her
head resting on a pillow. She was alone,
and had not heard my step. Was she
asleep! A quick sob answered me. That
augurs well for my success. In a moment
I was kneeling beside her, and raised the
bowed head.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Jessie, dear Jessie!" I said, tenderly,
scarcely knowing how she would receive
me.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With a quick start and a glad cry of sur-
prise her head was pillowed on my bosom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Oh! I am so glad to see you, Will.
They told me you would not return, and
I have been so lonely without you."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"And I have been lonely, too, Jessie,
darling," I said. "My home anywhere
would always be lonely without you. Will
you not go and share it with me?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The answer was very low, but I knew it
was in the affirmative.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Will you become my wife next week?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I was determined to make sure work now.
There was some hesitation and a few objec-
tions raised, but I finally gained the same
answer to that.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Then I hurried to the drawing room to
see the old folks. There was considerable
pleasure expressed at my unexpected ar-
rival, and great surprise, when my errand
was made known, and a few tears and re-
grets from the mother at parting with Jes-
sie, and hearty congratulations from the
father, concealed by the remark—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Is just as likely as not she will change
her mind while changing her dress."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I think I accomplished more in that half
hour than I ever did in twice that length of
time before or since, for at its expiration I
was supremely happy. And the result was
that in a week I got the prettiest and best
little wife in the world; and, what is better
still, I think so now, even though she did
say, ten minutes after the ceremony——{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I never told you I loved you, Will."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And she never has to this day.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
End of a Gambler.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}  A correspondent of the Portsmouth
Journal given the following account of one
of the many victims of the gaming table:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Of the many evil influences incident to
fallen humanity, the passion for gaming
may be ranked among the foremost. For
the drunkard, even in the worst stages of
that degrading vice, there is hope; but there
is none for the victim to the fascinations of
the gaming table who once they have
seized him in their iron grasp. One of the
worst instances of this nature, in final re-
sults, that has ever come to my personal
knowledge, occurred in this vicinity in the
case of a physician, the son of a most
worthy clergyman, recently deceased. Af-
ter the usual struggles that most of the pro-
fession experience, he succeeded in obtain-
ing, through the aid of kind friends, a prac-
tice sufficiently remunerative, besides af-
fording all the comforts of life, to enable
him and his little family to make the res-
pectable appearance in the community, re-
quisite to continued success in his calling.
Notwithstanding this evident prosperity,
however, which had been greatly advanced
by the generous acknowledgment on the
part of some of the older and more expe-
rienced physicians of their confidence in
his ability, there was a mystery about him
that those who knew him most intimately
were unable to fathom. While living in
an economical manner, and pressing the
payment of his bills on the plea that his
necessities required it, he did not diminish
the debts he had contracted to enable him
to acquire a knowledge of his profession;
obligations, in some instances, that he was
bound by every principle of honor and
gratitude to redeem, shared a like fate.
So far from reducing his liabilities, he was
continually adding to them,—often pro-
curing pecuniary aid from friends on various
pretences of sudden and unanticipated
need, which were found to be the grossest
fabrications. After living for several years
in this way, he accepted the situation of
surgeon on board a steamer bound to vari-
ous distant ports, on a voyage of about a
year's duration, giving as a reason declin-
ing health; but instead of returning home
in the vessel on her return, to resume his
practice, which he had left in the hands of
another member of the profession, he left
the steamer, and sent for his family to join
him at San Francisco.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From that time little was heard of him;
he forgotten was, in a measure, until the
details reached his former place of residence.
through the journals of San Francisco, of
one of the most awful tragedies, in which
he was the chief actor, that ever transpired
in a civilized community.  He had oc-
cupied the upper portion of a dwelling,
and nothing being seen of him or his family
for an unusual length of time, his fellow
tenants became alarmed, and failing to ob-
tain admittance by other means, broke
open the door, when a most frightful spec-
tacle presented itself.  He was found lying
in bed, with one arm extended over a
water-pail that was nearly filled with blood,
and had apparently been dead many hours;
by his side was his wife, and in an adjoin-
ing room their daughter and only child,
about ten years of age, in both of whom
life was also extinct.  From a couple
of brief notes that he had left, it was learned
that being in destitute circumstances,
he had administered strychnine to his family,
and then committed suicide by opening the
veins in his arm.  It seemed that in the
case of his child, the poison had not pro-
duced death so soon as he wished, and he
had then fractured her skull with an iron
window weight, that bore evidences of
having been used for that purpose. Such
a frightful tale of murder and suicide
naturaly excited, at first, the greatest as-
tonishment among those who remembered
him here only as a respectable physician,
until the fact became known that he had
been for a long time a confirmed gambler,
which fully explained, as a matter of course,
all that bad previously been incomprehen-
sible in his character. One of the most
thrilling of the dramas of a former day is
'The Gambler's Fate,' but it presents noth-
ing that equals the closing scene of this
modern tragedy of real life.{{< /news/text >}}

Jesuitism.

Concluded from page 207.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is time but to glance at the achieve-
ments of the Society. It excelled specially
in educational and missionary enterprises.
The former we have already noticed; the
latter they pushed so rapidly, that before
the Order was fifteen years old, missions
were established in every quarter of the
globe, and their converts? were numbered
by hundreds of thousands. Among their
missionaries, Francis Xaiver must be ac-
corded a first place. His first field was
India. The accounts of his labors there
are most wonderful. By a single sermon,
it is said, he often converted 1000 sinners!
He walked the streets of Goa ringing a bell
to attract the crowd of licentious inhabi-
tants, and when gathered, would melt them
to tears by the fervor of his eloquence. He{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}visited in turn every part of India, also
Japan, China, Malacca, Ceylon and the neigh-
boring islands, where he planted churches
and founded colleges without number.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In Brasil the missions were equally suc-
cessful. Antonia Rodrigues baptized in a
single year no less than 5539 disciples, and
on one occasion 1150! Of course the in-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}genuius reader may entertain a doubt
whether all these easily turned Christians
received also the baptism of the Spirit.
Even Jesuit records fail not to disclose the
speedy apostacy of thousands of such
converts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In every land where they carried their
missions, they won, if possible, first the gov-
ernment to their cause, and became confes-
sors of the king, and thus at one time they
were possessed of the secrets of every pow-
er in Europe. In England and Spain they
were most active agents in the political
revolutions of their times. All the parties
engaged in the famous gunpowder plot
were Jesuits, instigated by the noted Par-
sons and his coadjutors, who plotted the
rankest treason against the British crown.
It was in fact their effort to usurp political
Authority, which finally alarmed Europe and
led to the abolition of the Society by the
ban of Pope Clement XIV, 1775.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They had previously been impeached for
high treason in Portugal and banished 1759.
In 1764 they were driven from France as
dangers to the state. They thus contin-
ued under ban for a period of about fifty
years, or untill 1814 when by a bull from
Pius VII the order of Jesuits was restored
throughout the world. During the present
century they have attempted to regain their
former status but with poor success. The
spread of liberal views in Italy, Portugal
and parts of France and Germany has great-
ly weakened the Order, and for the last
few years it has been the unmost that these
soldiers of the Pope could do, to keep His
Holiness upon the throne, a feat which
there is reason to believe cannot much
longer be accomplished.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The origin, progress, and fall of the "So-
ciety of Jesus" has thus been rapidly and
by consequence imperfectly sketched. We
have seen how the Order from its germinal
state, in the Utopian, or rather Quixotian
brain of a wounded Spanish cavalier, was
rapidly developed amid the conflict and ex-
citement attending the great religious Re-
formation of the 16th century;—how dex-
terously the machinery and all the appliances
of the Society were fitted for the achieve-
ment of the intended purposes, and how,
nestled in the very bosom of the parent
church, and protected by her folds, it in-
fused new and unprecedented vigor into the
papal hierarchy, and grew in the short space
of two centuries to such marvelous dimen-
sions as seriously to threaten, not only the
stability of all the powers of Europe, but
even the subversion of the Church herself.
Of the crimes perpetrated by the Society,—-
of the wrong system of morals which they
inculcated,—-of the astounding schemes
of casuistry which they invented,—-of
the immense dispensary of anodynes for
wounded consciences, which they introdu-
ced into their confessionals, and thus, if they
could not reclaim from guilt, would, at least,
save from remorse,-—of all these and more
details of their history we have no time to
speak.  We beg to offer one or two reflec-
tions regarding the true significance of the
Jesuit movement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When Loyala came to the rescue of the
Romish church he found it in the greatest
peril.  Dissensions and corruptions within,
and the attacks of Protestantism from with-
out were daily decimating not less its in-
fluence than the number of its votaries.
Ignatius, filled with the chivalric spirit of
the times, saw the danger which threatened
the Papacy, and gallantly went forth to its
defense.  His quick eye detected the weak
places in the walls of his Zion, and he at
once set himself to repair the breach.  The
ingenuity he displayed is worthy of all ad-
miration.  The most popular cry raised
against the Catholic clergy of the day was
their extortion and avariciousness. Igna-
tius stipulated that his troops, however im-
portant might be their functions, should
have no pay. Licentiousness was guarded
against by the most solemn oaths of chast-
ity. Demoralization was forestalled by the
supreme virtue of obedience. The con-
tempt with which the monks had come to
be held, was escaped by imposing no rules
or regulations upon the active, public ser-
vants of the Order. They kept no fasts,
chanted no anthems, wore no cowls;—-did
nothing which would in the least distinguish
them from men of the world.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"When in Rome they did as Romans
did." In England they passed for Puritan
preachers; in China as disciples of Confucius
come to further unfold his great doctrines;
in Siam as new expounders of the mysteries
of Buddhism. "The end sanctifies the means,"
was their constant motto, and hence they
were ready to perpetrate any crime in the
calendar, if by it they could—as they sup-
posed—contribute to the greater glory of
God,—ad gloriam mojoram Dei. They
boasted, and still boast, (for they are the
same today as a century ago) that the main
facts of the Gospel were concealed from
the heathen converts, and they permitted
them still to bow the knee to false gods if
internally they would but repeat paters
and aves. Thus instead of elevating hu-
manity, they degraded the standard of re-
ligion to the level of corrupt society. Ev-
erywhere their spirit was the same, devo-
tion to a common cause, and obedience to
a central authority. Faith in ultimate auc-
cess, and untiring energy in its pursuit, a
careful selection of instruments, strict meth-
od and unity of effort and purpose, were
the means by which they accomplished so
great results. That the Society has retard-
ed the spread of correct moral principles
and the growth of true piety cannot be
doubted, and the undying prejudice im-
planted in the breasts of the heathen against
Christianity, by their hypocritical insinua-
tions, and too often base treachery, is one of
the most serious evils against which the
pure light of the Gospel has to contend.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And yet we are far from saying that Je-
suitism is wholly bad. In every picture
there are some shades of light. Absolute
darkness is never discernible. Evil and
good we ever find commingled here. The
Jesuits have given us the best exponent of
Roman Catholicism the world has seen.
They are and ever have been the chosen
defenders and representatives of the Papal
See. In educational and missionary enter-
prises they have led the world, and have
provoked others to similar good works.
And while with no regret, we see the star
of their destiny rapidly waning before the
advancing light of liberty and Christian
truth, we must yet believe that many of the
eminent servants of the Order, and perhaps
its illustrious founder, were actuated by a
genuine Christian zeal in the prosecution
of their work. The names of Francis Xavier,
Borgia, and Lainez, are worthy to be cher-
ished with kindly remembrance, and the
noble virtues which they exercised may well
be an example to the flock of Christ in all
ages.{{< /news/text >}}

The Court.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty the first King of Siam left
Bangkok for Ayuddhia on the 20th Novem-
ber to be present at the ceremony of laying
the foundation stones at three several
places, viz:—at the old royal residence at
Chandr Xem, or Chandr—Ksem Palace,
for the rebuilding of three distinguished
Royal houses namely "Vimanrathey" and
two Phra Parsuess left and right, which
have been there from the time that Ayud-
dhia first was the capital, when it was
occupied sometimes by the Kings and
sometimes by the Second Kings and Subor-
dinate Kings during several reigns. This
palace was built in the year corresponding
to 1399 of the Christian era. It lay in ruins
for a period of 90 years from 1767 till 1857,
when the walls were rebuilt and restored
to their former state, and some of the royal
houses were partly rebuilt. But the king
has determined to carry forward the work of
restoration near the high Tower which was
repaired last year. And His Majesty laid
the first stone at Temple Khamin near that
palace about 100 yards from it on the west
side. His Majesty also commenced repairing
the buildings at the great and high
Pagoda of Temple Khoon Seen which had
fallen to ruin and had been recently
repaired. His Majesty collected funds from
many thousands of Buddhist people to the
amount of 18000 tails to which His Majesty
added a donation of his own of 9000 Ticals.
The people were ready to contribute to
the work because they wished to have the
Pagodas large and high (about 100 cubits)
and falling to ruins; to be rebuilt as it was
situated only 3600 yards from that old
palace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The other Monastery with a pagoda
named Wat Senasn was repaired by the
king at his own personal expense of 50,000
ticals, now nearly completed. The repairs
were commenced about the time of the
rebulding of Chandra Xem palace three year
ago. It is now occupied by a party of
Buddhist priests. It situated about 160
yards from the wall of the palace at the
South western side.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty returned to Bangkok on
the 24th ulto arriving at 1 o'clock A.M.
and unfortunately met with the loss of
his royal aunt aged 75 years.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She died of Asthma at 1 o'clock and
50 minutes A.M. while the king was yet
remaining at his landing place holding con-
versation with his ministers who waited
on him on his return.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Second King is yet remaining at
his palace at Sitha, Sarapury, enjoying the

there is better than that of Bangkok, al-
though it is said that five of his attendents

month of November.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Fever was superabundant at Ayuddhia
the latter part of October and the fore
part of November. But since the strong
North winds came continually on the the
17th and 18th unto the fever almost disap-

Second Answer
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have beard your reply to mine and
should I decline any reply to it, the Siamese
might attribute it to great ignorance. I beg
therefore to answer it briefly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}You say that you fear that most of the
persons who have professed the Christian
religion in Siam are only Christians in
name and not in heart, and that therefore
there is little or no prosperity and glory
among them. Now touching this matter I
have carefully observed that the natives of
Siam who profess Christianity are much
more strict in the observance of it than the
Europeans who reside in Siam. They are
quite careless about religion, and seldom
or never enter a Christian place of wor-
ship. Now why is it that those men have
greater prosperity than the native Christians
of Siam?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again I have heard it said that in
Europe there is a large class of men who
once derided the Christian religion and
did not suffer any damage by such conduct;
that afterwards they turned their minds
and went to praising God and praying to
him. And finally, seeing that they got
nothing for their devotions, they made up
their minds that there is no living author
of Christianity and no maker of the worlds,
and that whatever is good or evil is only
in consequence of the eternal concentation
of natural causes and effects without any
Almighty ruler.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again you ask if the English at the
beginning of their nation were not ignorant
woodsmen, and that when Christianity en-
tered their villages and cities did they not
begin their career of prosperity under
its benign influences? I beg leave to answer
that I think England has prospered only
because she has given birth to many good
and wise men, and because she has had an
excellent copy of customs and laws, and
her sons have followed righteousness—For
these reasons she has become a great nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And finally how is it that other nations
which hold that a living God bestows
favors upon man, and hold to Christianity,
all the same as the English, French,
and the Americans, and do not prosper like
them? I beg that you will consider this.{{< /news/text >}}

The effect of Marriage.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Doubtless you have remarked with satis-
faction how the little oddities of men who
marry rather late in life are pruned away
speedily after their marriage. You have
found a man who used to be shabbily and
carelessly dressed with a huge shirt collar
frayed at the edges, and a glaring yellow
silk pocket handkerchief, broken of these
things and become a pattern of neatness.
You have seen a man whose hair and
whiskers were ridiculously cut, speedily be-
come like other human beings. You have
seen a clergyman who wore a long beard
in a little while appear without one. You
have seen a man who took snuff copiously,
and who generally had his breast covered
with snuff, abandon the vile habit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A wife is the grand wielder of the moral
pruning knife. If Johnson's wife had lived,
there would have been no hoarding up of
bits of orange peel; no touching all the
posts in walking along the street; no eating
and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If
Oliver Goldsmith had been married, he
would never have worn that memorable and
ridiculous coat. Whenever you find a man
whom you know little about oddly dressed,
or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any
eccentricity of manner, you may be tolera-
bly sure that he is not a married man. The
little corners are rounded off, and the little
shoots are pruned away in married men.
Wives generally have much more sense
than their husbands, especially when the
husbands are clever men. The wife's ad-
vices are like the ballast that keeps the ship
steady. They are like the wholesome though
painful shears, snipping off little growths of
self-conceit and folly.{{< /news/text >}}

Siamese Brig Railway
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Captain Peterson of the Hing Hoi re-
ports having received a letter from Cap-
tain Hansel of the missing Brig Railway
stating that the vessel had reached a
port in Hainan, named Haikow. The
letter was dated 11th of October, and
stated that after he left Hong Kong he
fell into a typhoon and lost both masts,
and had not a spare spar on board, and
was drifting at the mercy of the winds and
currents. There a British steamer took
the Brig in tow for 12 hours, but the
wind increasing, the steamer had to leave
her to herself, as the Captain of the steam-
er expected a typhoon, and after the
steamer left a typhoon ce?ne on and the
Brig leaking very much, and rolling very
heavily. After the gale was over they
found the vessel near the island of Hai-
nan, and managed to get in to Haikow, all
safe with all hands, but a great deal of
sickness on board. At Haikow he found
the Siamese barques Seaforth, and Sirius.
The Sirius was driven on shore by the
previous gale, and was still on shore, but
it was expected she would be got off again.
The Chinchews of the Seaforth and the
Sirius promised to lend the Chinchew of
the Railway money to get her bottom
caulked on a bank and to buy spars and
rigg her junk rig to bring her to Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}

Items.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In our last issue, we published an ar-
ticle from the highest authority, stating
that while His Majesty the supreme king
cannot yet see the utility of complying
with the oft repeated, and consequently
almost disgusting exhortations of his Eu-
ropean friends to launch out at once into
the enterprise of making railroads and tele-
graph lines, and thinks it would (to use
his own homely figure) "be better to spend
the money that would be required for that,
in the purchase of fuel for the burning of
the dead bodies of dogs, and for the hire
of persons to go all about the country to
gather them up for the burning," he is
ready to embark in public enterprises that
will certainly be of great utility to his
kingdom. He says, that in addition to the
new rod already completed, he has deter-
mind to construct two more.  One of
them is to commence at the old  Tapenhán
of which Chow Phya P'oot'araph'ai is to
have the charge.  The other is to be made
from Wat Chána Songk'ram from straight to
the palace of Krŏm Mun Mahĕsuan.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The writer says, furthermore, that His
Majesty has already determined to cut
many other new canals besides the qua now
being made from T'a-cheen River to
Bangkok, thinking that they will greatly
improve the facilities for cultivating rice
and making orchards and gardens.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We fondly hope that His Majesty will
press forward without delay in these no-
ble projects, which he cannot be too san-
guine will eventuate in great good to his
people, and enduring honor to his name.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}FAH KEE. This unfortunate craft after
splashing around in the gulf bottom up for
nearly a year is now laying right side up,
at the premises of Messrs. Virgin & Co.—
she looks a little the worse for salt water,
but we believe is very little injured by
worms, and can be easily repaired. Those
who had charge of the work of getting her
up deserve great credit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Excellency the Prime Minister left
on the evening of 20 ult, to prepare for the
reception of His Majesty, the supreme king
on the day following at the place where
the king contemplated the construction of
a canal through the prairies between Bang-
kok and the old city. We learn that the
route was to be newly surveyed under the
special supervision of His Majesty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The rice crop, we learn from the best au-
thority is uniformly promising, and that
there is no fear of any damage resulting to
it by the small showers we are now occa-
sionally having. The only fear is that the
reapers in consequence of the overflow-
ing water, abating but slowly, will have to
reap much of the rice in the water, and thus
suffer from the leeches that abound in the
paddy fields.{{< /news/text >}}

Ode to my new bonnet.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}Soft triangles of straw and lace,

{{< news/indent1 >}}That curves around my blushing face

{{< news/indent1 >}}With such a a'cey, bewitching grace,

{{< news/indent1 >}}No mortal man would dream your place

{{< news/indent3 >}}Was on my head.

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}Your airy touch can scarcely press,

{{< news/indent1 >}}The shape from curl or flowing tress,

{{< news/indent1 >}}So light, so next to nothingness,

{{< news/indent1 >}}You surely could not well be less.

{{< news/indent3 >}}And be a bonnet.

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}A bit of straw adorned with leather,

{{< news/indent1 >}}A yard of lace, a spray of heather,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Some bugles and a tossing feather,

{{< news/indent1 >}}These trifles maketh all together—-

{{< news/indent3 >}}Thus were you made.

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}No cape with starkly settling lined,

{{< news/indent1 >}}No bracken crown projected behind;

{{< news/indent1 >}}But streamers flutter in the wind—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}There flows, in silken mesh confined,

{{< news/indent3 >}}My waterfall.

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}Yet most your dainty form I prize.

{{< news/indent1 >}}As sweeping back above mine eyes

{{< news/indent1 >}}It lets the drinkled hillocks rise,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Where underneath in ambush lies

{{< news/indent3 >}}My pair of mice.

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}But when rough autumn windsweep past,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And all your faces shake aghast,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Then can you shield me from the blast,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And round my neck a shelter cast

{{< news/indent3 >}}To keep me warm !

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}Alas ! a summer friend are you,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And only kind while skies are blue ;

{{< news/indent1 >}}I long have known the saying true—

{{< news/indent1 >}}Old friends are better than the new

{{< news/indent3 >}}When trouble comes.

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent1 >}}So ere the dog-day heats be led,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Let me your flimsy glories spread;

{{< news/indent1 >}}For soon as winter whistles dread

{{< news/indent1 >}}I'll tie once more about my head

{{< news/indent3 >}}My old scoop bonnet.

REPUDIATION.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}Neath a ragged palmetto, a Southerner sat,

{{< news/indent1 >}}A-twisting the band of his Panama hat,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And trying to lighten his mind of a load,

{{< news/indent1 >}}By humming the words of the following ode:

{{< news/indent2 >}}"Oh! for a nigger! and oh! for a whip;

{{< news/indent2 >}}Oh! for a cokctail! and oh! for a nip;

{{< news/indent2 >}}Oh! for a shot at old Greeley and Beecher!

{{< news/indent2 >}}Oh! for a crack at a Yankee school-teacher!

{{< news/indent2 >}}Oh! for a captain! and oh! for a ship;

{{< news/indent2 >}}Oh! for a cargo of niggers each trip!"

{{< news/indent1 >}}And so he kept on, as he all had not,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Not contented with owing for all that he'd got.

Weight of People.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}What is the average weight of a man?
At what age does he attain his greatest
weight? How much heavier are men than
women? What would be the weights of
fat people—and what of very fat people?
M. Quetelet, of Brussels, some years ago
deemed such questions quite within the
scope of his extensive series of researches
on man. He got hold of every body
he could, everywhere, and weighed them
all. He weighed the babies, he weighed
the boys and girls, he weighed the youths
and maidens, he weighed men and women.
he weighed collegians, soldiers, factory
people pensioners—-and as he had no
particular [...] to disturb his facts, he
honestly set down such results as he
met with. All the infants in the Found-
ling Hospital at Brussels for a considerable
period were weighed, and the results were
compared with others, obtained at similar
establishments in Paris and Madrid. The
average returns show that a citizen of the
world, on the first day of his appearance
in public, weighs about six pounds and a
half—-a boy baby a little more, a girl baby
a little less. Some very modest babies
hardly turn the scale with two pounds and
a half, while other pretentious youngsters
boast of ten and eleven pounds. M. Quet-
elet grouped his thousands of people ac-
cording to age, and found that the young
men of twenty, averaged 143 pounds each,
while the young women of twenty have
an average of 120 pounds. His men
reached their heaviest bulk at about thirty-
five, when their average weight was 132
pounds; but the women slowly flattened on
until fifty, when their average was 129
pounds.  Men and women together, the
weight at full growth averaged almost
exactly 149 pounds.{{< /news/text >}}
