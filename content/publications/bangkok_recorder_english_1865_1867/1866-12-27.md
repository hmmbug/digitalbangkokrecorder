Children's Nutting Song.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}Who has no sunshine in his heart,

{{< news/indent2 >}}May call the autumn sober;

{{< news/indent1 >}}But boys with pulses leaping wild,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Should love the brown October.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Along the glade and on the hill,

{{< news/indent2 >}}The ruddy oaks are glowing,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And merry winds are out by night,

{{< news/indent2 >}}Through all the forests blowing.

{{< news/indent1 >}}The yellow moon is clear and bright,

{{< news/indent2 >}}The silent upland lighting;

{{< news/indent1 >}}The meadow grass is crisp and white,

{{< news/indent2 >}}The frosts are keen and biting.

{{< news/indent1 >}}A shining moon, a frosty sky,

{{< news/indent2 >}}A gusty morn to follow,—

{{< news/indent1 >}}To drive the withered leaves about,

{{< news/indent2 >}}And heap them in the hollow.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Hurrah! the nuts are dropping ripe

{{< news/indent2 >}}In all the wildwood bowers;

{{< news/indent1 >}}We'll climb as high as squirrels go,

{{< news/indent2 >}}We'll shake them down in showers.

{{< news/indent1 >}}When heads are gray and eyes are dim,

{{< news/indent2 >}}We'll call the autumn sober;

{{< news/indent1 >}}But now, with life in every limb,

{{< news/indent2 >}}We love the brown October.

{{< news/text >}}CHILDREN MAY teach us one blessed,
one enviable art—-the art of being easily
happy. Kind Nature has given to them
that useful power of accommodation to
circumstances which compensates for
many external disadvantages, and it is
only by injudicious management that it
is lost. Give him but a moderate por-

Price of Salvation.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Several years ago, a missionary among
the Indians was visited by a proud and
powerful chief, who had been deeply
convicted of sin by the Spirit of God.
The savage, while trembling under a
sense of his guilt, like a great many civilis-
ed persons, was unwilling to take the
water of life freely, and hence offered
his wampum to avert the dreaded punish-
ment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The man of God shook his head, and
said,{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"No, Christ cannot accept such a sacri-
fice!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Indian went away, but unable to
rest beneath the frowns of his Maker,
came back and offered his rifle and the
skins he had taken in hunting.—The
missionary again said,
"No, Christ cannot take such a sacri-
fice!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The wretched sinner withdrew, but the
Spirit gave him no peace, and he return-
ed once more to offer his wigwam, his
wife, his children, and all that he had, if
he could only find pardon and eternal life.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The missionary was compelled to say,
"No, Christ cannot accept such a sacri-
fice!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The chief stood for a moment with his
head bowed, as if on the verge of despair,
and then raising his streaming eyes to
Heaven, his heart poured itself forth in
a cry of unreserved surrender and con-
secration :{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Here, Lord, take poor Indian, too!"{{< /news/text >}}

Thackeray's Habits.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}No man ever more decidedly refuted
the silly notion which disassociates genius
from labor. His industry must have been
unremitting, for he worked slowly, rarely
retouching, writing always with great
thought and habitual correctness of ex-
pression. His writing would of itself
show this; always neat and plain; capable
of great beauty and minuteness. He used
to say that if all trades failed, he would
earn sixpences by writing the Lord's
Prayer and the creed (not the Athanasian)
in the size of one. He considered and
practiced calligraphy as one of the fine
arts, as did Porson and Dr. Thomas
Young.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He was continually catching new
ideas from passing things, and seems fre-
quently to have carried his work in his
pocket, and when a thought, or a turn
struck him, it was at once recorded. In
the fullness of his experience he was
well pleased when he wrote six pages of
"Esmond" in a day; and he always
worked in the day, not at night.—He
never threw away his ideas; if at any time
they passed unheeded, or were carelessly
expressed, he repeats them or works them
up more tellingly.—In these earlier writ-
ings, we often stumble on the germ of an
idea, or a story, or a character with which
his greater works have made us already
familiar.—-Dr. John Brown.{{< /news/text >}}

Gen. Baird's Report.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Since Johnson's defense of it, perhaps
no further evidence was needed that the
New Orleans riot was an atrocious mas-
sacre in the interest of treason. But Gen.
Baird's report discloses facts not hereto-
fore known, and clearly proves that the
men Voorhees, and Munroe, and Herron,
with whom Johnson corresponded, and
under whose orders he put Sherman, were
the guilty abettors of this murderous af-
fair. They prepared beforehand a brigade
of rebel soldiers as special police.—They
armed them with navy revolvers.—They
drew them off their beats the night pre-
vious, They deceived Gen. Baird as to
the time the convention was to meet, thus
securing the absence of the soldiery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Then they marshaled their forces with
military precision and murderous intent.
While the negro procession was attacked
on one side, they cut off retreat on the
other.—They spared none of the defense-
less unfortunates, thus surrounded. Their
carts carried off the dead and disposed of
them. They practiced on the pirates'
motto, that "dead men tell no tales."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Then they got up a grand jury, the fore-
man of which was a rebel Colonel, and
every member of which had been a traitor,
and issued a tissue of lies which they call
a bill of indictment. Such is the travesty
of justice, and the relapse into barbarism
which the President of the United States
disgraces the nation by defending in this
year of grace 1866.—UTICA HERALD.{{< /news/text >}}

Anecdotes of Dogs.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}"A dog in a monastery, perceiving
that the monks received their meals by
rapping at a buttery door, contrived to
do likewise, and, when the allowance was
pushed through, and the door shut, ran
off with it. This was repeated till the
theft was detected.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Another dog, belonging to Mr. Tay-
lor, a clergyman who lived at Colton,
near Wolseley Bridge was accused of
killing many sheep. Complaints were
made to his master, who asserted that
the thing was impossible, because the
dog was muzzled every night. The
neighbors persisting in the charge, the
dog one night was watched, and he was
seen to draw his neck out of the muzzle,
then to go to a field and eat as much of
a sheep as satisfied his appetite. He
next went in to the river to wash his
mouth, and returned afterward to his
kennel, put his head into the muzzle again,
and lay very quietly down to sleep.{{< /news/text >}}

Tennessee.

{{< news/centre >}}
THE WICKED GO UNPUNISHED.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is a very difficult thing for a freed-
man to get justice in the courts. Almost
every day some poor fellow makes his
way to Nashville, wounded and distress-
ed. His employer or some other villain,
in a moment of excitement, has fired on
him with the intention of killing him.
The truth is, there is a class in the South
who would rather shoot at a negro than
at a fox or a squirrel. They think it
sport. They have no regard for his life
or limbs. Half a dozen freedmen have
been shot dead or dangerously wounded
in this county within a few months past,
and yet no man has been punished, and
I doubt whether any one of the cold-
blooded murderers of freedmen I see on
the streets every day, will ever be pun-
ished. They never will be if Andrew
Johnson's policy is indorsed by the
northern people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Your readers will remember that a
most bloody massacre occurred some
months since in Memphis. Many of the
most foul murders that have been per-
petrated in any country were committed
in that city; and the murderers are well
known, yet no one has been indicted by
the grand jury, and no one of them has
been arrested. The civil authorities will
not punish them, and the military are
restrained by that man at Washington,
who rose to power when Abraham Lin-
coln was assassinated. HE HAS REFUSED
TO AUTHORIZE THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES
TO BRING THE MEMPHIS MURDERERS TO
JUSTICE.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now these are sad facts, and they
portend evil. The faces of Union men
in Tennessee are becoming troubled and
anxious, and they have but one hope.
If the northern people at the coming
elections speak with a voice of thunder
in condemnation of Johnson's policy,
then all will be well; that is their hope.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I can not think that the great struggle
through which we have passed, at the ex-
pense of so much blood and treasure, is
to end in nothing substantial and val-
uable; and it does not seem to me
possible that President Johnson can be
permitted by the Almighty to blast the
hopes of the most gallant nation under
the sun.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I will add a news item, that Major
General Fisk has been dismissed the ser-
vice. He is one of the noblest of men,
but could not indorse Johnson. His
removal is a heavy stroke on the freed-
men, and all loyal men here feel indig-
nant.—-RELIGIOUS TELESCOPE.{{< /news/text >}}

Riot at a Camp Meeting.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Camp-meeting, near Baltimore, the
last of August, attended by both white
and colored, was set upon by a gang of
rowdies and broken up. Several negroes
were badly beaten and wounded, and a
white man, while at prayer, shot in the
head and killed. The attack was first
made on the colored people, who rallied
two or three times and drove their as-
sailants from the ground; but their tents
were broken up, their trunks pillaged,
the contents burned, and they were fin-
ally driven to their homes.{{< /news/text >}}

Texas.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gen. Kiddoo, Assistant Commissioner writ-
ing Gen. Howard says:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The greatest trouble I have in the ad-
ministration of the affairs of the Bureau
of this State consists in protecting the
Freedmen from lawless violence. Mur-
der and outrage are largely on the in-
crease. Every mail from the interior
brings me reports from my agents, and
other trustworthy sources of information, 
of murders, from one to five at a time, of
negroes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I am left so powerless to give proper
protection, for want of troops to sustain
my agents and make arrests, that I grow
sick at heart, and wonder at the war
power of the government leaving this
unfortunate class of people, whom it
liberated by force, thus exposed to the
violence of a chagrined and life-long
enemy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The following is from a letter written
by a Southern-born Texan to a friend
in New York:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Matters are going from bad to worse
in Texas, every day. Crimes of violence,
especially against freedmen, are fright-
fully on the increase. Since 5 p. m.
yesterday (and it is 9 a. m.), four cases
of murder of negroes have been reported
to me, and none of them will be men-
tioned by the press.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The loyal element here, white and
black, is overwhelmed with gloom. The
United States officers, civil and military,
in Texas are here on SUFFERANCE, and
have not the power to sustain themselves
if attacked.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gen. Wood, Commissioner for the
Bureau, reports from Columbus, the
same disposition to take advantage of
ignorant freedmen, and discharge them
without breach of contract on the freed-
men's part. Crime is on the increase, and
murders are reported in Noxubee coun-
ty. A colored man was taken from Mr.
Ryles's house, near Palo Alto, and, after
being beaten, had his ears cut off and was
partially castrated. The civil authorities
have not as yet punished the offenders.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}District, Jackson—-A case of murder
occurred here which the civil authorities
refused to notice. Cases of attempt to
kill and running off of colored men by
dogs, etc., are reported: they are being

HAS THE GENERAL STATE OF SOCIETY IM-
PROVED IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Let the following facts answer:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}1. THE MASSACRE OF COLORED PEOPLE
AT MEMPHIS. The result is summed up
by the investigating committee as fol-
lows: let it go upon the record, and go
down to posterity: Colored people killed,
46; whites, 2; rapes on colored women,
5; maltreated, 10; robberies, 100; houses
and cabins burned, 91; churches, 9;
schoolhouses 12. Value of property de-
stroyed $130,991.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Most of these colored people were
murdered in cold blood; men and women
were shot in bed; little children were
dragged out, and their brains clubbed
out on the spot. In one instance, a sick
girl, one of the most promising scholars
in Memphis, arose from her bed, and
rushed out of the flames, but was shot
and thrown back and burned to a crisp.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}2. THE MYSTERIOUS REMOVAL OF TWO
TEACHERS, FOSTER AND M' COOL, FROM
CORINTH, MISS. They were modest, in-
offensive young men, from Ohio. Threats
were made against them, of which they
took no notice, but proceeded with their
school, sleeping in the school-house, for
they could find no white family who
would board them. One night after a
heavy discharge of musketry about their
house, all was still, and next morning
they were gone. They have never been
seen or heard of since, though the Mayor
of Corinth, and the Freedmen's Bureau,
have put forth commendable efforts to
find out the men who removed them; as
yet they have learned nothing. A young
lady then undertook to teach the school;
she taught but one day, for that night
the house was burned down.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}3. THE RECEPTION OF ANONYMOUS
LETTERS AND THREATS. One Union man
in Huntsville has received as many as
four or five, warning him to leave.
Threats of personal violence have been
made against the Superintendent of the
work of the M. E. Church. Efforts of a
public and private character to bring into
disrepute the ministers of the Methodist
Episcopal Church—the studied effort to
prevent our purposes—the circulating of
a slanderous report through the societies
formed by Rev. Mr. Lakin, in Jackson
country, Ala., that he had been convicted
of horse-stealing and sentenced to the
penitentiary, and had finally run away.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}4. THE SURROUNDING OF THE PLACE
OF WORSHIP IN LA GRANGE, GA., where
Rev. J. H. Caldwell was holding services,
and annoying them from evening to
evening, firing as many as thirty to forty
shots of an evening, so the whistle of the
bullets could be distinctly heard about
their heads.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}5. The holding of an indignation
meeting because we dared to visit Oxford,
Ga., and preach to the colored people;
and the writing of an insulting letter
calling in question the character of one
of the oldest and most reputable minis-
ters of the Georgia Conference, for no
cause, except he had come back to his
mother, the Methodist Episcopal Church.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}6. The burning of one church at
Jonesboro, Ga., as soon as purchased by
the Methodist Episcopal Church; and the
burning of a school-house.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}7. THE PERSECUTION AND ANNOYANCE
OF UNION MEN in other fields, till such
men as Rev. Jno. Murphy and Rev. J.
W. Talley cry out, “We can not stand it
much longer unless the Government
protects. Is there no help?—-Why do
rebels reign?” and the other, “Our per-
secutions are as great as Wesley’s.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}These facts, with scores of others that
now lie before us, go to show the state
of society in this country. Will any
man say that the rights of conscience are
respected, that Union or Northern citi-
zens are respected?-—Cin. Papers.{{< /news/text >}}

Bangkok Recorder.

{{< news/centre >}}
December 29th 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Our paper.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It now becomes our duty to inform
the subscribers for the “Bangkok
Recorder” that we have determined
to suspend the paper when the last
No. of this second volume shall have
been issued. Our reasons for so do-
ing are, first, that we cannot longer af-
ford to suffer the continual pecuniary
loss we do by it; second, that we can-
not afford the time it requires in the
editorial department as it interferes
too much with our great work of
preaching the gospel to this heathen
people; and third, that in assuming
the editorial charge of the paper last
January we had no purpose of contin-
uing in such charge longer than a
year, thinking that we could at or be-
fore the expiration of that time trans-
fer the entire responsibility of it, to
other hands. But now as we have
received no proposition from other
parties to this end, we feel compelled
hereby to give notice that the paper
will be suspended after the issue of
the 52nd No. of this volume, until some
other party shall come forward to as-
sume the care and responsibility of
it continuance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As we shall have an extra amount
of office work at the beginning of the
next year, we think it quite likely
that we shall be obliged to postpone
the last No. of the paper until
week after next.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A glide up the Broadway of
Bangkok
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We propose now to conduct our
readers up Broadway another sail to-
wards the royal palace. As we stop-
ped in our previous glance at the
Prot. Church, we will resume it at that
place, and proceed along glancing
first on one side of the river and then
on the other as we before did.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On your right hand, next above the
Church, is a pleasant brick house of two
stories, built by John Gunn Esq. a few
years since, now we think, owned by a
Chinese Importer, and is at present
occupied by J.C. Campbell, Inspector
of Customs. It has the usual hip-roof
of European brick buildings, is covered
with earthen tiles, and has a tasty front
yard which, as usual, with all residences
on the river is without any front fence.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next above this is the establish-
ment of the BANGKOK Dock Co. It
is quite humble in its external appear-
ance, having little more than wooden
buildings, thatched with attap leaves
to exhibit to passers by on the river,
and these not at all tasty or comman-
ding in their appearance. But the
Dry Dock itself is thoroughly made
and the machinery for pumping it
dry and the machine-shop connected
with it, are quite complete and abun-
dantly efficient. It was put into oper-
ation more than a year ago, and has,
as we have been informed, been well
worked ever since. It is certainly a
great advance upon the usual native
mud-docks which are not few even
in its vicinity. Capt. John Bush,
Habor Master and Master attendant
deserves great credit for this grand in-
novation of old custom of which he
has been the chief man in the concern
from the beginning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Turning your eyes to the opposite
side of the river,-—that is the western,
you will see an almost unbroken line of
floating houses extending from a point
about opposite the Church up as far
as the bend in the river will allow
you to look. These most singular
dwellings and mercantile shops are,
probably, on an average about 40 by 30
feet on their base, but one story high,
and that only eight feet from floor to
beam. The roof of each house is
double,—-that is two distinct two sided
steep roofs of nearly equal size cover
it, causing the house to look as if there
were two distinct houses placed in
close contact side by side with their
gable ends looking up and down the
river, the front roof being always a
little lower than the one in the rear.
An eve-trough passes through each
house where the twodouble roofs meet,
and this is always seen within six or
eight feet above the floor. Each house
has a narrow open verandah fronting
the river, and a closed one on each
end and back side. They are all en-
closed either with bamboo wattling or
teak boards. Each house is kept
from sinking by its own independent
raft or float of bamboos, ranging from
five to six hundred poles in number.
They are all moored end to end, with
only two or three feet space between
each, by means of teak posts driven
into the bed of the river, from two to
four at each end; and the houses
are made fast to them by large
wooden rings which slide up and
down upon them to conform to the
rising and falling of the tides. The
harbor laws requires that they shall
form an even line, so far as their fron-
tage is concerned, so as to make them
as little as possible a nuisance on the
river. You will scarcely never see any
one of them painted, and very seldom
with a bright and lively wood color,
but contrariwise all of them of a
gloomy, gray, weather,-beaten look,
like the attap thatching with which
they are uniformly covered. But ac-
casionally you will see a small break
in the line, which is the front opening
to the river of a bright brick house
on the shore. And the number of
such bright openings has increased
latterly very manifestly. But they
are notwithstanding as yet quite
sparse. The intermediate houses
which stand thickly on all the lots are
mostly of wood of two stories,about half
of them enclosed with bamboo wattling
and the other thatched with attap.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But it is time to glide up the river
a little, and have a look on the right
hand side again. Passing the Dry
Dock a few rods you will see here
and there a Buddhist temple, none of
them very imposing, with mud-ducks
insterspersed among them, until you
come next door to the Roman Catho-
lic Cathedral. Here is a spacious, but
a very uncouth one story brick build-
ing, which for several years, till with-
in a few months last past was occupied
by Messrs Virgin & Co as a variety
Store and Ship Chandlery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The R. C. Cathedral stands some
twenty or thirty rods from the bank of
the river. It is a singular looking
structure, built many years ago of so-
lid brick work, one of its ends fronting
the river, and strangely narrow, as
seems to us, for the purposes for which
it was made. There is a Collegiate
Institute in its immediate vicinity,
buildings small but chiefly of brick,
and far from being inviting to transient
spectators in their external appearance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing the large commons in front
of the Cathedral, you come next to
the Union Hotel, consisting of a cou-
ple of two storry wooden houses,
standing close to the bank of the river,
nearly of the same size, and seperated
but a few feet from each other. They
each have a front verandah with a
foot bridge from the one to the other,
so that the two houses become practi-
cally one. They are enclosed partly
with teak, partly with bamboo,
thatched with attap, and have the
usual weather-beaten gray gloom of all
unpainted wooden houses in Bangkok,
with the exception that some of
their window blinds are painted green
and give to them a little brightness of
look. The LIQUOR BAR is quite con-
spicuous from the river as seen through
one of the green window openings,
and there can be little doubt that it al-
lures many precious souls into the
fatal snares of the spirit of wine which
is a "mocker".{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The next establishment above this,
is one of the most tasty dwellings of
all the foreign residents in the city.
It is a large and lofty two storied
white brick building, with a spacious
upper verandah enclosed with white
venitian blinds. The lower open
verandah leads into the variety Store
and Ship Chandlery of Messrs Remi de
Montigny & Co. The hall of the Store
opens in the rear into a very spacious
and inviting go-down in which are
exposed a great variety of European
goods.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The next building above this is the
French Consulate. It is a brick two
story house erected by the Siamese
government and consequently not very
comely of itself, but, when fitted up by
a French official, with a tasty front
yard attached, it looks quite well.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Immediately above the French
Consulate you come to the establish-
ment of the Siamese minister of ag-
riculture,—CHOW PHYA POSLATAPE.
The buildings are many and nearly all of
brick, located near the river, not at all
imposing and with a confused and
cluttered front.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Passing up eight or ten rods, you
will come to the residence of Doct J.
Campbell R. N. &c. &c., surgeon to
the British Consulate. It is a tall two
story brick house, thatched with at-
tap, with wide verandahs all about it,
and a very pleasant door-yard in
front.{{< /news/text >}}
</div>
{{< news/br >}}
<!-- Article: 1866-12-27_2_5 text -->
<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}The Premises of the British Con-
sulate come next in order on the next lot
above. It is a large place, comprising,
we should judge, some three or four
acres of land, with a frontage on the
river of more than 300 feet. There
are three large brick edifices on the
place besides several smaller ones.
The one used for the Consulate is of
the most solid brick work, of three
tall stories, with a hip-roof, covered
with earthen title. The front veran-
dahs of the 2nd and 3d stories are
enclosed with rather course venitian
blinds, and till quite lately unpainted,
and consequently of a gloomy look.
They are now painted a lead color
which, though not at all lively, is quite
an improvement on what it was formerly.
The business of the Consulate is mostly
transacted on the lower story, and the
rooms are spacious and pleasant. This
building stands ten rods from the
river, and that open space is adorned
with a great variety of shrubbery and
curious plants peculiar to Siam, collec-
ted by the late Sir Robert Schom-
burgsk. The other two dwellings are
each of two tall stories, but less
spacious than the office building. One
of them stands about fifteen rods from
the river and the other twenty five,
yet so as to give to each a good river
view. There is a commanding sala
at the landing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the next lot above is the
Portuguese Consulate with much less
imposing buildings, nearly all of brick.
But there is a large brick building going
up very slowly, designed to become
the chief building of the establishment,
and would seem to have been well
planned and thus far executed for a
tasty edifice.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nearly in front of this is the Ship
Chandler's Store of Messrs Sandberg
and Co. just on the bank of the river,
a very small concern to look at from
the boat, but one of a good deal of
business done in a cheap way.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the rear of the new building of
the Portuguese Consulate, some forty
rods from the river, is the site of the
Am. Baptist mission, you have only a
partial view of but two of the dwell-
ings of the mission. The other is
quite hidden in the rear of the Por-
tuguese Consulate. Two of the build-
ings are of brick, the other partly of
brick and partly of wood, and all of
two stories and covered with the in-
combustible tiles. By the kindness of
the P. Consul the missionaries have
the free use of the large commons be-
tween them and the river, with a good
brick walk to the common landing.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Just at the corner of this com-
mons, you will see a long wooden
building of a story and a half one
end on the bank of the river, at-
tap-thatched, and neatly painted.
This is a branch of the French House
of Malherbe Jullian & Co. in which
you will find a great variety of Euro-
pean goods, strongly inviting you to
make purchases.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the rear of this is a large brick
go-down, of commanding appearance,
as it stands out with uncommon bold-
ness from all other buildings; but it has
never seemed to be much occupied.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As our reporter of to-day’s sail is not
allowed to extend this chapter much
farther, he will have to stop here in front
of the Am. Baptist mission, only adding
that we are still nearly half a mile
below the range of floating houses on
the Eastern side of the river, while
the line on the opposite side is quite
continuous from where we last looked
at it, and extends up the river as far as
your eyes can see.{{< /news/text >}}

CHAPTER IV.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In speaking of the Siamese as de-
rived from the Shans, in my first
chapter, I said that branch which wan-
dered off to the sea towns and vicinity,
became much modified by intermarry-
ing with other nations; These in the
immediate sea towns intermarrying
mostly with Chinamen. Once while
visiting the Sanatarium at Anghin I
was not a little amused and interested
in tracing the early history of the town,
and I dare say others have a similar
one. But it may be more difficult to
trace in less healthy towns. Here
people live to a good old age, proving
its good qualities for a Sanatarium in-
dubitable.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Chatting one day with the wife of
the official for the Chinese part of the
population, she told me her great
grandmother, Yai Rong, died some
twenty years ago aged one hundred
and ten years. And she took me to
visit her husband's mother Yai Chan,
still one of the most beautiful ladies I
have ever seen in Siam. This old lady's
mother, and the great grandmother of
the Palat's wife, and the mother of
another old lady of the village, Yai
Bu yet full of life and affection, though
more than eighty years old, were all
heroines in their way.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the Burmans made their last
aggressive war into Siam, some six
reigns since, and destroyed the old
capital, laid wast the country, seized
booty and people everywhere to enrich
themselves, and left the country
without a king and without hope, these
three old ladies found an asylum at
Anghin, and eventually became the
wives of some staid old Chinese bach-
elor fishermen, who had built a few
huts in the then almost trackless forest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Tall oaks from little acorns grow,
Largestreams from little fountains flow"
But let the old ladies tell their story.
Yai Bu tells me that four large boats
crossed over the Gulf from the western
coast of Siam, fleeing from the invad-
ing Burmans, and stopped at Anghin
as the best hiding place, there being
nothing there to attract the invaders.
They remained one year at Anghin
while the Burmans were invading and
bearing away their booty. and then
refitted their boats, spread their sails,
and returned to their old homes in the
west.{{< /news/text >}}
</div>
{{< news/br >}}
<!-- Article: 1866-12-27_2_9 text -->
<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}But in the interim of one year a fair
daughter had been won by a staid old
Chinaman, and when the friends,
parents, uncles, aunts, and cousins
returned to their old town and homes
and effects, this one girl let the whole
family of relatives depart while she
clave to her husband. She never had
occasion to regret her choice. Her
husband was always true and kind.
They were one flesh. They reared a
large family of children and saw them
well married and well settled. But as
then Anghin had few inhabitants, the
girls married casual visitors from other
towns on the coast and formed a nu-
cleus for other towns. One daughter
for example has a large family of des-
cendants in Rayawng, a town still
further down the coast.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Yai Bu married at Anghin. There
was a fine young Chinaman of twenty
five, came to this land of Canaan, to
the hard pressed poor people of the
great over populated empire at the
north. He made his way to Anghin.
Yai Bu was in her girlhood, full of
energy and thrift, imbibed from her
industrious Chinaman father. The
young emigrant soon wooed and won
her. And they, a fine young couple,
put their heads together how best they
could secure an honest livelihood.
Sometimes he gave himself to the
“kappi” business, snaring a sort of
sardine and steaming it for the Siamese
market, or salting it for export. Yai
Bu, a helpmate entered into all his
plans, and by her thrift made the most
of what her good husband had provided.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And what proved a great stimulus
to both, they reared a large family of
children. Ten boys and girls crowned
their board, and seven grew up to
manhood and became the centres of
new families clustering around the old
homestead, and raising up children to
marry in turn and enlarge the original
circle, till now old Yai Bu can hardly
number the children and grand-child-
ren and great-grand-children that live
in her very neighborhood.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In talking with the Palat's wife of
her old great-grand-mother we became
quite excited over the subject. She
died after her great grand daughter had
married aud become the mother of
children. So she could gather round
her children of the fourth generation.
The Palat's wife remembers perfectly
the stories of the old lady of what she
had seen and heard and suffered. Those
were troublous times for Siam indeed,
when the Burmans made their last
onset upon the country. The people
fled everywhere in the greatest conster-
nation. Thousands and thousands died
of hunger and want and exposure. Of
whole families that were driven from
homes, to seek a hiding place as they
might, often only one survived to tell
the tale of terrible suffering. Such
was the fate of Yai Rong.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She wandered on foot from one of
the towns north of the capital, hiding
in holes and caves by the way when
she saw a depredator on her track. So
hiding and escaping, she eventually
reached Anghin and here found an
asylum and a home, for she married
one of the Chinese fisherman of Ang-
hin.{{< /news/text >}}
</div>
{{< news/br >}}
<!-- Article: 1866-12-27_2_10 text -->
<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}Here she stayed in peace when
P'raya Täk came to Bangplasoi on his
way to conquest and rule. Here she
was in peace during all the rule of
P'ra Putta-yäwt-fä and P'ra Putta-
Lert-lä and till the close of the last
reign. Yai Rong had survived all
these changes, living quietly at Anghin,
her children's children's children rising
up to call her blessed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Her great-grand-daughter who was
a mother before she died, has now a
large family of children, she too, the
only wife of her husband, is destined
to be allied by marrige to many of the
prominent officials on the eastern coast.
The eldest son is allied to one already,
and several fair daughters cannot fail
to be honorably married soon. I hope
they, like their mother, will all be-
come honorable examples to all the
Siamese people of the good state policy
of allowing only one wife.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The mother of the Palat, daughter
of the third heroine, speaks Chinese
well, as well as Siamese. She seems
a little proud of her Chinese descent,
as to that she is indebted for her de-
licate complexion. Her husband came
from China, a young man of twenty,
without money and without friends,
except an old uncle at Anghin. But
he was evidently very enterprizing,
and gradually became wealthy, also
much honored by the king, as he re-
cieved the title of - "Lord of the stone
town." He was long the ultimatum [?]
of all town business of all kinds and
character at Anghin, and seemed to
fulfil his duties to the satisfaction of
all parties, up to the day of his death
which occured only a few years since.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His high position subjected him to
temptation. It was with him as has
been with officials elsewhere. They
are a terror to evil doers, but being
officials do evil with impunity. He
dealt in opium on a lage [?] scale, and
more dared do so without that pro-
tection from government which comes
from paying taxes. It was eventually
known to the king, and he was oblig-
ed to pay a large fine. But his large
fortune enabled him to do so without
serious detriment, and he gave his
energies to fisheries and trading in
other departments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are now seven children of his,
all living in Anghin, well married and
thrifty, living near neighbors to the
old lady their mother, who occupies
much the most important native house
in the village, and is called by all the
people, her ladyship. The old gentle-
men seems to have set off his children
a homestead from his own lands, and
built them a house as they severally
married, and they each became a new
nucleus, and now there is a large circle
of grand-children who are taught to
hold in high esteem their honored
grand-father and his distinguished
lady.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The house the old lady occupies was
built by her husband after a Chinese
model, and very much after the man-
ner of old Jewish houses in Bible times,
having an open court surrounded by
picturesque buildings. What most
interested me was the rural appearance
of the rear yard. This must have been
long long ago the shore of the sea, and
the washings of the ocean has piled
up quite a hill of very picturesque ap-
pearance of lime deposits. This hill
is made to act an important part in a
summer house where the old lady takes
her afternoon nap, and at the same
time affords convenient nooks for
storehouses, cookery establishments
and eating departments, which the old
lady told me complacently had former-
ly been fully occupied though now
quiet reigns there the livelong day.{{< /news/text >}}

LOCAL.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}AN EXPLANATION—-We have been
casually informed that we made a
misstatement in our last issue concern-
ing what was once the Am. Steam
Rice Mill of this city. We are always
sorry to hear of any errors made in
our articles, for the desire of our hearts
and steady aim ever has been to be
strictly accurate when we have stated
anything as a fact. We honestly thought
that what we said of that Mill concer-
ning its present owners was correct.
But now we hear from good authority
that no part of the Mill is owned by
natives. We have the impression that
a part of the concern is owned by
Messrs. Pickinpack Thies & Co.—but
how much we know not. We should
have been very thankful for an accu-
rate statement of the matter directly
from its present owners for our pres-
ent issue. But failing of this, we off-
er this as a substitute.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Death.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is our painful duty to record the
death at her late residence in this city, of
Mrs Bush, wife of Captain John Bush,
Harbor master and Master Attendant
of this Port, on Thursday evening the
27th inst. In her death, the husband
has been bereaved of a beloved and
most amiable wife, the children (eight
in number) of a good mother, and this
community of foreign residents of a
very lovely and distinguished member.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mrs Bush had been latterly some-
what subject to ill turns for which she
had been to the Sanitarium at Anghin
twice within the last few months and
with the happiest results. On her
return some three weeks since, she
seemed to be quite a picture of health,
and continued to be so regarded until
a short time before her death. There
was scarcely one of all her foreign
friends in this city outside of her own
family, who had the first thought of
her being sick until they were astonish-
ed by the report of her death. It ap-
pears that she had been somewhat in-
disposed several days with an irritable
stomach which disabled her from taking
food. On the night of the 26th she
had suffered from vomiting more than
was usual, which so weakened her by
8 or 9 o'clock A. M. of the 27th as to
give her friends the first alarm that her
life might be in danger. Dr. J. Camp-
bell was consequently called, and
found that she was indeed in imminent
danger. He remained in attendance
nearly all the day, but found that the
medical art could do no more than
simply prolong a little the flickering
life. She departed in the perfect pos-
session of her reason most calmly and
without a struggle at 7 P. M. We
think her age was about 37 years.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A post-mortem examination has
revealed, as we have been informed,
several inflamed patches on the mucous
membrane of the stomach.{{< /news/text >}}

took place yesterday at 4 P. M. and

foreign residents, and several represen-
tatives of the Siamese government.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}It appears that the late celebration
of the birthday of His Excellency
Chow Phya Kalahome on the 23d inst.
was the most joyful, exuberant, and
splendid of any one of the 58 that had
proceeded it. It is said that there was
a very unusual amount of congratula-
tory contributions to the occasion, made
by princes, nobles, lords, and people,
that H. M. the king, besides many oth-
er valuable birthday presents, was
pleased to honor the right arm of his
government by a gold tical for every
year of his life, a silver tical for every
month of his life, and an att for every
day of his life. His Majesty has over
been remarkable for counting the years
of his own life as well as that of his
friends, by months and days. We
think he seldom fails, when closing
any letter, to give the number of days
he has reigned.{{< /news/text >}}

Lincoln's Refinement.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In his notes of life at the White house
Mr Carpenter expresses regret that Dr.
Holland, in his life of Lincoln, admitted
that Mr. Lincoln frequently indulged in
anecdotes not entirely delicate, and at-
tempted to excuse the fact by the lack
of refining influences in his early life.
Mr Carpenter expresses the belief that
the memory of Mr Lincoln has been
wronged in this matter, and says :—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"It is but simple justice to his memory
that I should state, that during the entire
period of my stay in Washington, after
witnessing his intercourse with nearly all
classes of men, embracing governors, sen-
ators, members of Congress, officers of
the army and innate friends, I cannot
recollect to have heard him relate a cir-
cumstance to any one of them which
would have been out of place uttered in
a ladies' drawing-room. And this testi-
mony is not unsupported by that of others,
well entitled to consideration. Dr. Stone,
his family physician, came in one day to
see my studies. Sitting in front of that
of the president, with whom he did not
sympathize politically, he remarked with
much feeling. 'It is the province of a
physician to probe deeply the interior
lives of men; and I affirm that Mr. Lin-
coln is the purest-hearted man with
whom I ever came in contact. Secretary
Seward, who of the cabinet officers was
probably most intimate with the pre-
sident, expressed the same sentiment in
still stronger language. He once said to
the Rev. Dr. Bellows; "Mr Lincoln is
the best man I ever knew !" "{{< /news/text >}}

Isthmus of Krah.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the days of Fraser and Furlong's
visit to the Isthmus of Krah, we have felt
convinced that the world would not long
allow, a very short cut from Bengal and
from Burmah, to Siam, to Saigou and to
China to remain unimproved. Two ama-
teur gentlemen of considerable exper-
ience, but without a particle of Engineer-
ing skill or information set up their opinion
in opposition to two scientific Engineers
relative to the practicability of using the
Isthmus either for a canal or for a rail-
road. The two gentlemen opposed to
the short cut to Siam and China were
Mr. Crawford member of the Royal
Geographical Society of London, and a
member of Parliament for the city, and
a Mr. Vaughan, Magistrate of Singapore,
both of whom have tried to move heaven
and earth against the scheme. They
have declared it to be impracticable.
Indeed it is with them impossible. The
splendid Pak Chan river which forms the
boundary at the south of British Burmah
would hold a fleet and has good anchor-
age. At the head waters of that river, a
railroad could be constructed or a Canal
dug by which the long and dangerous
route to China VIA the Straits would be
avoided.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the "STRAITS TIMES" of the 20th
October, we find the first favorable
notice made of the probability of open-
ing this Isthmus of Krah route. When
John Bull gets his pride touched by a
Frenchman or an American doing what
he supposes to be his work, he is in-
stantly roused, and claims the honor of
doing his own proper business. The
lamented Mr. O'Rielly who traveled a
great deal over the peninsula first drew
attention to the Isthmus, in a paper he
sent to the Royal Geographical Society
of England. He too like the Engineer
officers, strongly recommended the cut-
ting either of a Canal or the laying down
of a railroad to connect the gulf of
Siam. The plan has so many obvious
advantages that it led to an application
being made to the Siamese Government
by a Mr. D. K. Mason to construct the
necessary work. Permission was granted
and a strip of one mile of territory clear
across, the Isthmus was set apart for this
grand enterprise. If the work was not
commenced in ten years from the date
of the grant, it was to cease by effluxion
of time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now a French Engineer steps on to
the scene and engages to dig a canal
across for the passage of Ships, provided
the King of Siam will give him not the
mile of way granted to the Englishman
but nothing less than a strip of twelve
miles broad from gulf to gulf. Of course
the request is very modest. We trust
the King of Siam will not do such an
unkingly act, as to break his word with
Mr. Mason, who is represented as now be-
ing engaged in forming a Company with
the necessary capital for the construction
of the work. Possibly the opposition of
Mr. Crawford and Mr. Vaughan will now
cease, since they find, that if an English-
man is not 'permitted' or encouraged in
this grand scheme, a French engineer
will raise the capital required for it in
Paris.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Singapore must 'consent' with a good
grace, to loose all that part of the trade,
which passes from the bay of Bengal to
Siam and China. We might as well
advise the people of the United States to
cling to the old route round Cape Horn,
and to withdraw from the Isthmus of
Panama, as to tell the Commercial world
that the Isthmus of Krah is worthless.
Commerce is seeking the most derect,
easy, and safest routes from one market
to another. By piercing the Isthmus a
short cut is obtained, which greatly dimi-
nishes distance, time expense and risk.
A Canal of twenty five miles long is all
that is needed. As a mere national work,
it is nothing of which to boast. If there
were physical difficulties in the way which
could not be overcome, then we might
hesitate to embark in this enterprise.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Three such men as Mr. O'Rielly,
Colonel Fraser and Major Furlong are a
guarantee that the project is, as they de-
clare, perfectly feasible. It was upon
the testimony of these gentlemen. who
knew the Isthmus of Krah, by actual
travel and observation, that we confront-
ed the visionary theories of Messrs.
Crawford and Vaughan. Both these
gentlemen fought the Krah scheme tooth
and nail, for over a period of five years,
one in London, the other at Singapore, and
the reason is, they are both personally
and pecuniarily interested in the southern
seaport. The public of British Burmah
simply asked for the subject to be looked
at on its own merits. If it is a good
plan, adopt it. If a bad one, reject it.
A French engineer says it is a good
scheme and he has already opened a
Krah office in Paris to give information
concerning the matter and preparatory to
issuing a Prospectus, for the formation
of a Company. If English Capitalists
with all the honest and reliable informa-
tion there is before them, deliberately
make up their minds not to dig these
twenty five miles of a Canal, them let us
not act the part of the dog in the manger
who would not eat the bone himself nor
allow any other poor dog to eat it. If
Mr. Crawford and Mr. Vaughan had
given to Colonel Fraser and Major Fur-
long's report the support it deserved in
Commercial circles, we should have had
the Isthmus of Krah Canal opened by
this period, for the passage of ships across
from from gulf to gulf.—RANGOON TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

Corea.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The every startling intelligence con-
veyed to its readers by the EVENING
MAIL of last night to the effect that the
French squadron had suffered a very
severe repulse before Saoul and had been
compelled to withdraw from the scene of
operations with its ships in a seriously
damaged condition, and with the loss of
forty men killed and wounded, has all
the appearance of being an enormous
exaggeration.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In all probability the true facts of the
case are that the French Admiral finding
no living enemy to oppose him, but ex-
periencing the very great difficulties of
an advance into a strange and hostile
country at an unfavorable season of the
year, has simply and wisely sent the ves-
sels of his squadron into winter quarters
with the intention of resuming active
operations so soon as the summer of next
year opens up the rivers and renders
movement easy and less dangerous in the
Corea.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That the Koreans met their invaders
with "rifled cannon, revolving carbines
and as some assert needle guns" is sim-
ply incredible, and we are astonished
that our contemporary should have al-
lowed himself to be made the victim of
such an unqualified blunder. Pray from
whom, if not from the Powers of Dark-
ness, could the Coreans have obtained
such weapons and learned their use, sim-
ple and ignorant as they are. We don't
question their eagerness to learn. We only
query their opportunities.—-HONGKONG

{{< news/text >}}MONSIEUR GIQUEL is going to raise,
arm, discipline and command a Chinese
Naval force, for the service of the Im-
perial Chinese Government, along the
East and South Coasts of China, and on
the lakes and rivers of the interior. One
of our Contemporaries puts it that this
force is raised not precisely for the ser-
vice of the Imperial Government, but
for the service of the four Viceroys rul-
ing the Coast and river in the provinces of
South China. They are doubtless the
promoters of it, and it will serve under
their immediate orders, within their re-
pective viceroyalities and will be paid
out of funds at their disposal for local
purposes, and not out of the Imperial
Treasury. But for all that, the new navy
will be an imperial force just as much as
the armies now serving in the interior of
China under different viceroys and Gov-
ernor Generals are emphatically imperial
troops though raised and paid by some
particular province. Before making any
arrangements for the formation of the
new naval force the viceroys have had
to memorialize the Cabinet at Pekin and
to obtain the imperial assent to their
plans. At every stage of their operations
they will have to report and memorialize
and memorialize and report, and they
will have to pay respectful obedience to
any mandate that comes from there,
whether it be an order to increase the
force or to alter its constitution or do a-
way with it entirely. We sincerely re-
joice at the prospect of some improve-
ment taking place in Chinese naval af-
fairs. They are in a most deplorable
state. Their fleets badly manned, worse
officered, armed with the most useless
lumber in the shape of artillery that was
ever seen in the arsenal of any nation,
are more like pirate hords than like the
armed force of a nation so populous, so
wealthy and in many respects so power-
ful.—-HONGKONG MERCURY.{{< /news/text >}}

the incessant prayer of life. The poor
want riches, the lonely want compan-

the maidens want husbands, the sick
want health, the wicked want peace,
the drunkard wants, rum, the weary
wants rest. So it goes. In some form
or other we want help. Help for the,
muscles, the brain, the heart, the soul,
the understanding. We go up and
down in the world seeking for it.
When we find it, up comes a new call.
It is always help, more help. "Help
wanted." Of course it is. Wanted
at every house in Boston, New York,
London, Prais, every city and place

{{< news/text >}}Among the few passengers whose
courage and presence of mind rose
superior to the night, was a mother,
who succeeded in saving her two little
children by the means of a floating
settee.—-While they were in the water,
the mother saw a man swimming to
wards the settee, and, as he was about
to grasp it, she cried, "Don't take it
from my poor children!" The man
made no answer, yet the appeal struck
home; for, by the light of the flam-
ing vessel, she could see that his face
was convulsed by the struggle between
the mighty primal instinct of nature
and something better and holier. It
was but a moment. He threw up his

flung himself over backward and went

Laughing

faw, because these are worked by muscles
under the dominion of volition; but your
diaphragm, the midriff, into which your
joker pokes his elbow, he is the great
organ of genuine laughter, and he, as
you all know, when made absurd by hic-
cup, is masterless as the wind. But it is
not well that we are made to laugh; that
from the first sleepy gleam moving like
sunshine over an infant's cheek, to the
cheery and feeble chirrup of his great-
grand-father by the fireside, we laugh
at the laughable, when the depths of our
strange nature are dappled and rippled,
or tossed into wildest laughter by anything,
so that it be droll, just as we shudder

Theodore II. and the empire
of Abyssinia.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The cruelties practised by the Sovereign
of Abyssinia towards our Consul Cameron
and the other British subjects who have
had the misfortune of being found within
the sphere of his brutality, were fre-
quently made the subject of discussion in
both Houses of Parliament during the
recent Session. According to the most
recent intelligence it appears that the
Emperor of Abyssinia, maddened by the
losses he had sustained in an attempt to
suppress a formidable revolutionary mo-
vement at Tigré ; and, suspecting that his
enemies had been assisted by British guns
and British soldiers, had ordered Mr.
Consul Cameron, Mr. Rassam, and his
other English captives, to be beheaded.
Whether this last statement be true or
not, the atrocities already committed by
this regal tyrant are quite enough to in-
vest him with a horrible interest in the
eyes of Europe generally ; but more
especially in those of Englishmen, whose
fellow-countrymen have suffered such
cruel indignities at his hands.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the writings lately published of
M. Lejean and M. Du Camp, two French
gentlemen, who have visited Abyssinia,
we gather the following extraordinary
facts regarding the Emperor of Abyssinia
and his subjects:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Sovereign or Negus, as he is cal-
led, of Abyssinia, has, unfortunately for
himself, obtained an unenviable notoriety
throughout Europe. His name is often
mentioned as a ruler who has made him-
self remarkable for the most childish as
well as the most cruel eccentricities. In
1854 an insurrection arose amongst the
great vassals of the country, whilst a
worthless Negus lived in luxury and
idleness in his Palace of Gondar. The
present Emperor took advantage of this
state of things to gratify his ambition, and
the following curious story is related of
him:-—One evening an officer, named
Kassa, visited the Lake Tana, and, hav-
ing pronounced some magical words over
it, there immediately arose from the wat-
ers of the lake a throne, on which was
seated a black man dressed in regal attire,
with a crown upon his head. The follow-
ing colloquy took place between them:—-
“Thou hast called me,” said he to the
officer, “dost thou know who I am?”
“I know that thou art the chief of bad
spirits. Shall I reign?” “Thou wilt
have an agitated life. Answer me, then
—-shall I reign?” “Yes;” and the spirit,
with his throne, immediately disappeared.
Well, this same officer, Kassa Kuaranna,
son of Hailo (a man of high origin) and
of a woman whom misery had so reduced
that she was obliged to eke out a living
by the sale of Kouse [?] in the streets of
Gondar, is to-day the Negus Theodore
II., the King of Kings of Ethiopia. It
was no easy matter for him to climb the
ladder that raised him to the throne.
He had to struggle hard against almost
all the chiefs of the canton. At times he
was exposed to much misery, and had to
fly from his enemies. He, however, pur-
sued his course with an energy and a
cunning which saved him from being
surprised or captured by his enemies.
He was indebted as much to treason as
to his arms; to his deeds of darkness and
cruelty as to his duplicity, for his suc-
cess. At length he arrived to the posi-
tion of absolute Sovereign of a people
who, a short time before, sought to des-
troy him. The battle of Dereskié, which
made him Emperor, was fought on Feb.
5, 1855. The following day Kassa took
officially the name of Theodore, as he
knew that there was an old tradition
which declared that a Negus called
Theodoros would re-establish the king-
dom of Ethiopia, annihilate Islamism,
and retake Jerusalem from the Infidels.
In virtue of a custom of the ancient
Sovereigns, he also kept near him during
his official receptions four tamed lions,
whose close familiarity at times was by
no means agreeable to his retainers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the day of the coronation of
Kassa an era of tyranny scarcely con-
ceivable opened upon Abyssinia. One of
his first proclamations, ordering each
person to pursue the profession of his
father, had the effect of collecting to-
gether a troop of bandits, who, acting
upon the literal interpretation of the
imperial edict, demanded the confirma-
tion of their right to exercise the pro-
fession of their fathers, who were high-
way robbers. Pressed by the obstinacy
of the brigands and by his own words,
the Negus was compelled to grant the
authorization which was asked of him.
The marauders had, however, scarcely
turned their backs when they found
themselves surrounded by a body of the
loyal cavalry, who immediately fell upon
and sabred them to a man.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Theodore once ordered the arrest of a
religious missionary who had been guilty
of the unpardonable crime of bearing his
old name of Kassa. Having first ques-
tioned the unfortunate captive, he had
him tied to a tree. Then, uttering the
words, “In the name of the most Holy
Trinity,” he shot him dead on the instant.
Sometimes a shade of irony would be
mixed up with the ferocious justice
which he exercised. A soldier had killed
two merchants. “Why did you assass-
inate them?” said the Negus. “I was
hungry,” was the answer. “Could you
not have simply robbed them?” “If I
had not killed them they would have
prevented me.” The Emperor, exasper-
ated by this ingenious cynicism, ordered
the two hands of the soldier to be cut off.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}and to be served up to the man on a
plate, saying, "Ah! thou art hungry;
well, eat!" The Negus has, however,
his moments of mirth. On one occasion
he ordered the chief prisoners to be
brought to his table, and there forced
them to drink of the khousso, the most
abominable purgative which could be
imagined.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The unfortunate Consul of England,
covered with chains, has been forced to
drink each morning his bottle of khousso,
and sometimes, in addition, to suffer from
the bastinado. No, language, however
wise, has any effect upon Theodore's in-
fatuted mind to induce him to alter his
infernal system of cruelty and injustice.
The Negus believes seriously in his mis-
sion. In a public discourse he has dared
to say, "I have made a compact with
God. He has promised me not to des-
cend upon earth to strike me, and I have
promised Him not to ascend to heaven to
combat Him.' God strikes all those who
place themselves in my way." To his
advisers who try to induce him to re-
nounce his cruelties, he answers that a
sovereign has no one but God alone to
render an account to. Theodore believes
in his mission. What is it? He has ex-
plained it himself: "This people have a
hard head, and require chastisement be-
fore being called to enjoy the blessings
of Providence. I will be the plague, the
judgment of God, upon Abyssinia!' And
as the new programme of his reign, he
has had engraved upon his howitzers,
"The plague of the perverse—-Theodore."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Under such a rod of iron the people
do not feel themselves at ease; they
murmur constantly, and revolts are fre-
quent. Each chief of a canton wished
to be independent, and perhaps to follow
the bad example of usurpation which
Theodore has given him. The Emperor
himself is always at war. His mind, at
the same time turbulent and profound,
restless and cunning, is constantly form-
ing strategic plans, which do not always
succeed. He moves about with an ex-
treme rapidity in order to surprise his
enemies, and never reveals his projects
until the last moment. In defeat as well
as in victory his cruelty is the same.
After the battle of the Oullos, in 1862,
he caused to be cut off a foot and a hand
of 8000 prisoners. "This operation was
not long being executed," said a native
priest to M. Lejean, "inasmuch as each
soldier seized his man and cut off the
limb as coolly as if it were a log of mut-
ton he was carving. After the battle of
T'chobar, 1700 captives were massacred
and left unburied. When he fell upon
a province and when his orders were
asked, he answered, "Eat all." Follow-
ing those expeditions in which no hab-
itation was spared, the prisoners were
mutilated and rendered for ever power-
less; villages were burnt, with harvests
and forests; huge pits were filled with
dead bodies, and human blood in-
fected the drinking-fountains. Theod-
ore's heralds were soon running through
the doomed districts, crying, "Listen to
what the Emperor says: 'I have chastis-
ed the perverse; I have killed 22,000 men.
Peace to honest people; nothing shall
trouble them." Now, these "perverse"
are always the Abyssinians. Is it, then,
surprising that they should sing in secret,
"Happy News! There is no more dust
upon the roads, because the trees are
covered with hanging men. Five doses
of leprosy, six doses of famine: these are
what we have gained under the reign of
the Negus."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Negus has a family, and, as God
has promised the future to the House of
David, from which he boasts his descent,
he is easy as to the lot of his children.
He has two adult sons; the second of
whom, it is said, possesses many good
qualities, and has already obtained so
high a degree of popularity as to excite
the irritability and jealousy of his father.
But as to the elder son, he is described as
a brute beast, who even surpasses his sire
in cruelty. As an example of his wick-
ed disposition, he, on a certain occasion,
sent to his father some baskets actually
filled with human eyes plucked out from
the heads of his victims, and at another
time he amused himself by filling the
ears of certain prisoners with cartridges,
and setting fire to the explosive material.
Once, becoming irritated by such ex-
travagant cruelties, the Negus had him
arrested and confined in a stable full of
asses, telling him that there at least he
would feel himself at home. Since M.
Lejean left Abyssinia, it stated that this
ferocious animal has been put to death.
