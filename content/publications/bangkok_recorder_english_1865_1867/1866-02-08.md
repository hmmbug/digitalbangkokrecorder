"Nigger Equality."
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Eighty-nine years after the procla-<br/>
mation of the sublime creed of human<br/>
equality, which has been an inspira-<br/>
tion to humanity the wide world over,<br/>
our ears are pained and our souls made<br/>
sick here in our own America with the<br/>
brutal and vulgar outcry of "nigger<br/>
equality." Here in Christian and re-<br/>
publican America, every effort of pa-<br/>
triotism, liberty, justice, and huma-<br/>
nity to lift the burdens imposed upon<br/>
a poor race by centuries of slavery—-<br/>
every effort to instruct the intellect,<br/>
darkened by years of oppression—-is<br/>
stigmatized by the brutal and vulgar<br/>
demagogism of America as "nigger<br/>
equality." "Nigger equality!" When-<br/>
ever I hear a man, born in this land,<br/>
educated in these free schools, taught<br/>
in these Christian churches, instructed<br/>
in these varied industries, prate about<br/>
"nigger equality," I accept it as a<br/>
confession that he instinctively feels<br/>
that the negro is his superior, and de-<br/>
mands legislation, to make him his<br/>
inferior. "Nigger equality!" It is<br/>
the language of brutality and vulgari-<br/>
ty. No gentleman in America prates<br/>
about "nigger equality." The crea-<br/>
ture that is so base as to do so must be,<br/>
and is a vulgar fellow. He may live<br/>
in a fine house, he may dress in the<br/>
garb of a gentleman; but a noble or<br/>
manly sentiment never dwelt in his<br/>
bosom. I remember on one occasion,<br/>
when a senator was addressing the<br/>
Senate, and indulging in calling a<br/>
negro a nigger, that Mr. Seward turned<br/>
to me and said: "That man will<br/>
never be President; the people always<br/>
mean to elect a gentleman for Presi-<br/>
dent; and the man who spells negro<br/>
with two g's can never be President."<br/>
He is a vulgar fellow who raises an<br/>
outcry about "nigger equality," and he<br/>
is a poor, pitiable creature who fears<br/>
it. Under just, humane, and equal<br/>
laws, no man should look up to any<br/>
one as his superior, nor down to any<br/>
one as his inferior. The poorest man<br/>
in the land is entitled to equality be-<br/>
fore the law with the wealthiest citi-<br/>
zen of his country. His cabin may be<br/>
humble; but it is as sacred as the<br/>
palace of the rich man. His wife may<br/>
be clothed in rags; but she is shielded<br/>
by the same equal law that protects<br/>
the jeweled bride of the richest man<br/>
in all the land. His child may be a<br/>
little barefoot boy, but he is the peer<br/>
of the son of wealth and pride.<br/>
Away with the brutal, vulgar, wicked outcry<br/>
about "nigger equality." It was born<br/>
of the pit. Send it back to its native<br/>
depths. Remember those other words<br/>
that come to us from the heavens: "In-<br/>
asmuch as ye did it unto the least of<br/>
these, my brethren ye have done it<br/>
unto me.” Walk the earth with your<br/>
forehead to the skies, in the conscious<br/>
dignity of the equality of humanity—-<br/>
that you are men that God made and<br/>
for whom Christ died—-and that it<br/>
degrades not, but ennobles him who<br/>
lifts up the sons and daughters of toil,<br/>
misfortune, and sorrow, of all the<br/>
races and kindred of men.—-Henry<br/>
Wilson.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Cattle Disease.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
From N. Y. Independent.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
I was happy to observe, in your is-<br/>
sue of the 26th of October, a notice<br/>
in the Farmers' Column of the cattle<br/>
plague, which is making such terrible<br/>
devastation amongst the herds in Eng-<br/>
land. It is important that our far-<br/>
mers should be fully apprised of the<br/>
terrible character of this contagious<br/>
disease, and be prepared to meet it in<br/>
a decided and summary manner, should<br/>
it unfortunately be brought to this<br/>
country. That it will be brought to<br/>
our shores, unless efficient measures<br/>
are taken to prevent it, is certain. This<br/>
disease, or plague-—rinderpest, or<br/>
Pleuro Pneumonia, as it is variously<br/>
termed—-has once been brought here,<br/>
and its ravages were only stayed by<br/>
the very energetic manner in which it<br/>
was disposed of by the Massachusetts<br/>
legislature. Three cows and one heif-<br/>
er arrived in Boston from Holland<br/>
on the 23d of May, 1859. Two of<br/>
these cows were sick when landed.<br/>
The first died in one week, the second<br/>
two days after. On the 23d of June<br/>
the third was found to be sick. She<br/>
was kept with some twenty or thirty<br/>
head of cattle. She died on the 29th<br/>
of June, and on that day three calves<br/>
were taken from Mr. Chenery's (the<br/>
importer) farm to North Brookfield.<br/>
The disease spread through the Che-<br/>
nery herd, and was propagated from<br/>
the calves sent to North Brookfield to<br/>
such an extent that a large number of<br/>
different herds were affected. The<br/>
prospect became so alarming in a short<br/>
time that a petition was sent to the<br/>
legislature for authority to take action<br/>
in the premises. Unaware of the fa-<br/>
tally contagious nature of the disease,<br/>
the legislature hesitated until thirty-<br/>
five days of precious time was lost;<br/>
but on the 4th of April, 1860, a com-<br/>
mission was appointed, with authority<br/>
to kill every animal that was sick or<br/>
had even been exposed to the conta-<br/>
gion. The commissioners entered at<br/>
once upon their work, and with the<br/>
utmost expedition executed the law to<br/>
its very letter. The result was that<br/>
in the whole 870 head of cattle were<br/>
killed and buried.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The disease was entirely extermi-<br/>
nated in North Brookfield and the<br/>
surrounding towns, and has never<br/>
made its appearance in that neigh-<br/>
borhood since. In Belmont, the suc-<br/>
cess of the commission was not so<br/>
complete. There was a greater oppo-<br/>
sition there to the operations of the<br/>
officers of the law, and less faith in<br/>
the contagious and dangerous charac-<br/>
ter of the disease; and, consequently,<br/>
less care in exposing well animals to<br/>
the insidious infection. The result<br/>
has been that the disease has reap-<br/>
peared several times in the region<br/>
around Boston; but has so far been<br/>
met at once by the most decisive ac-<br/>
tion on the part of the government,<br/>
and exterminated so far as it could be<br/>
discovered, so that at this moment we<br/>
are not aware that a trace of the di-<br/>
sease is known to exist.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
"WHAT CAN BE DONE?"
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}
In answer to that enquiry, made in<br/>
your article referred to, I would say<br/>
that all our experience leads us to one<br/>
conclusion, viz.: that the most prompt<br/>
and energetic measures should be<br/>
adopted for its extermination as soon<br/>
as a case is discovered. It is all idle<br/>
to tamper with'it at all. That has been<br/>
the fatal mistake in England. They<br/>
have tried to cure the disease, but with<br/>
no success. It is incurable. They have<br/>
talked of "Sanitariums," where cattle<br/>
might be treated. They have hesitated,<br/>
and delayed, and dreaded to act, until<br/>
the disease has got a terrible foothold,<br/>
and the loss of cattle must be immense.<br/>
Prevention is worth more than any<br/>
attempt to cure. In the first place, our<br/>
Congress should be applied to, as soon<br/>
as assembled, to enact a rigid quaran-<br/>
tine law, so that no foreign cattle<br/>
shall be introduced, until they have<br/>
passed a thorough probation on some<br/>
island in the harbor to which they are<br/>
brought. They should never be al-<br/>
lowed to land in any town or city.<br/>
Their very tracks and droppings may<br/>
be infectious, as experience has abun-<br/>
dantly proved, in this country and<br/>
Europe.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Considering what a terrible calamity<br/>
the introducing of the disease upon<br/>
our prairies would be, it is a matter<br/>
of grave question whether it would<br/>
not be better to interdict entirely the<br/>
importation of any cattle from abroad.<br/>
We have all the best breeds well esta-<br/>
blished in this country, and from them<br/>
we can propagate in purity and safty.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
In the second place, each state should<br/>
enact a law which should authorize<br/>
the officers of every town or city in<br/>
which it appears to take immediate<br/>
measures for its extermination. And,<br/>
in the third place, all farmers should<br/>
be on the lookout for the disease, and<br/>
be especially cautious in regard to im-<br/>
ported animals.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
And last in order, but perhaps first<br/>
in importance, the press should keep<br/>
the people well informed in regard to<br/>
the prevalence of the disease abroad,<br/>
or any indication of its presence in<br/>
this country.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The terrible extent and alarming<br/>
fatality of the disease in England may<br/>
be inferred from the fact that the<br/>
London Star has a column, more or<br/>
less, devoted in every day's issue to<br/>
its progress in that country, to the ac-<br/>
tion of different bodies in regard to it,<br/>
and the efforts made to prevent its ex-<br/>
tention. We observed that, in one<br/>
case, it is stated that, of 140 cows be-<br/>
longing to one nobleman, 120 had died.<br/>
It seems to be the most exciting topic<br/>
at present in Great Britain, as mani-<br/>
fested in its press universally, and I<br/>
trust the farmers of this country, es-<br/>
pecially those of the West, who are<br/>
most deeply interested, will not hesi-<br/>
tate to call loudly for some action on<br/>
the part of Congress in relation to the<br/>
subject.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
William Ewart Gladstone.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
BY PETER HAYNE.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Mr. Gladstone is unquestionably the<br/>
first practical man in England. In pre-<br/>
ciseness and originality, Thomas Car-<br/>
lyle and John Ruskin stand above him:<br/>
but if it is of genius wedded to action,<br/>
of magnificent power, engaged not in<br/>
thinking or in writing, but in working,<br/>
that we are in quest, the man who tow-<br/>
ers above all rivals is William Ewart<br/>
Gladstone. The liberals, all of them<br/>
who deserve the name, regard him as<br/>
their future leader, and anticipate the<br/>
day when he will be Prime Minister<br/>
of England. So late as 1845 Sir Ro-<br/>
bert Peel was still the great protection-<br/>
ist minister, and Gladstone, honored,<br/>
esteemed, promoted by Peel, was his<br/>
right-hand man in the House. But<br/>
the fallacy of the protectionist theory<br/>
dawned upon Gladstone before it be-<br/>
came apparent to the mind of his lead-<br/>
er. The logic of Cobden was irresis-<br/>
tible to this hope of the unbending<br/>
tories. To their infinite disgust he de-<br/>
clared for free trade, and resigned his<br/>
place in the cabinet of Peel. But Sir<br/>
Robert himself soon yielded to the<br/>
force of reason and to the terrible de-<br/>
monstration of the Irish famine. His<br/>
declaration for free trade brought<br/>
Gladstone again to his side, and until<br/>
the death of Peel there was not one<br/>
of his lieutenants in whom he reposed<br/>
confidence so implicit as in Gladstone.<br/>
The tories were too stupid or too sel-<br/>
fish to follow their leader in his new<br/>
policy of free trade, and the old con-<br/>
servative party was broken up.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
In the coalition cabinet of Lord A-<br/>
berdeen, which began the Russian<br/>
war, Mr. Gladstone once more took<br/>
office as Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br/>
It speedily became evident that he<br/>
had found his place, and, since the day<br/>
when he first presided over the fin-<br/>
ances of Great Britain, no other fi-<br/>
nancial minister has had a chance a-<br/>
gainst him.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Installed in the office of Chancellor<br/>
of the Exchequer, and with scope given<br/>
him by the appreciating though not<br/>
sympathetic Palmerston, Gladstone<br/>
has been engaged for a series of years<br/>
in undoing that antiquated legislation<br/>
by which the commercial and manu-<br/>
facturing energies of Great Britain had<br/>
been hedged round and bound up.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Year after year he has remitted taxes<br/>
tion, but year after year he has shown<br/>
a larger surplus. City men, the cold<br/>
hearts and calculating heads of the<br/>
Stock Exchange, were afraid of him.<br/>
They called him speculative, reckless,<br/>
fanciful, visionary. City men, as John<br/>
Bright says, are always wrong, because<br/>
they can conceive no higher motive<br/>
than selfishness, have no faith in man,<br/>
and think that generosity must issue<br/>
in loss. * *
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Those who look well into the char-<br/>
acter and have accurately studied the<br/>
career of Gladstone, deem it possible<br/>
that he may yet appear as a reformer<br/>
in connection with nobler tasks than<br/>
any which have hitherto engaged him.<br/>
The province of spiritual reform still<br/>
lies before him. The universities of<br/>
England, instead of being open on<br/>
equal and honorable terms to the<br/>
whole people, are tied to the skirts of<br/>
the Anglican ecclesiastical establish-<br/>
ment. The Church of England—all<br/>
that is vital in it—groans under the<br/>
bondage of the State. To an intellect<br/>
like Gladstone's it seems impossible<br/>
that it should not become plain that<br/>
the day has arrived in England when<br/>
all Churches ought to be free from<br/>
state control,' and when no Church<br/>
ought to receive state endowment;<br/>
when parliaments and governments<br/>
ought to see in the subjects of Queen<br/>
Victoria, not Churchmen and dissent-<br/>
ers, but Britons; and when university<br/>
education ought to be trammelled by<br/>
no sectarianism, monopolized by no<br/>
class. Representing Oxford in the<br/>
House of Commons—Oxford, the seat<br/>
from time immemorial of classical<br/>
pedantry and political obstruction—<br/>
and surrounded by timorous, luke-<br/>
warm liberals, Gladstone has as yet<br/>
been compelled to maintain a certain<br/>
reticence respecting the Church and<br/>
the university. But he has said enough<br/>
to make the old tories fear and young<br/>
liberals hope. It is my clear convic-<br/>
tion, besides, that the questionable or<br/>
equivocal utterances of Mr. Gladstone<br/>
on the subject of the American war<br/>
have been indications rather of the<br/>
necessities, the unavoidable influences,<br/>
of his position, than the expression of<br/>
his profoundest convictions. I be-<br/>
lieve that, in his heart of hearts, he is<br/>
rejoicingly proud to behold the brow<br/>
of the great democracy rising grandly<br/>
over the obscuring clouds of slavery<br/>
and rebellion.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Opulence of intellectual, emotional,<br/>
spiritual power—that is the idea to<br/>
which one always returns in contemp-<br/>
lating Gladstone. He is an athlete of<br/>
the intellect, a Hercules to whom the<br/>
labors of thought are as play His<br/>
political toils have been sufficient to<br/>
tax an ordinary or even an extraor-lin-<br/>
ary man; but he is a distinguished<br/>
classical scholar, has a fine taste in<br/>
sculpture, and is a connoisseur in pot-<br/>
tery. His speeches are a tissue of facts<br/>
and figures, the multitude of them a-<br/>
mazing; but they are always arrayed<br/>
in order so admirable, and arrayed in<br/>
eloquence so glowing, copious, and<br/>
splendid, that they are as armies par-<br/>
aded on a field of cloth of gold. When<br/>
Lords Palmerston and Russell leave<br/>
the stage, William Ewart Gladstone<br/>
will be the man of men in England.—<br/>

How General Jackson kept
Sunday.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
General Jackson went down to New<br/>
Orleans upon an occasion, and met, of<br/>
course, with an enthusiastic reception<br/>
from his old friends and comrades in<br/>
arms.—The latter appointed a com-<br/>
mittee to make arrangements for a vis-<br/>
it to the "battle ground," about seven<br/>
miles below the city. Without con-<br/>
salting the General, or thinking parti-<br/>
cularly about the day of the week, they<br/>
appointed Sunday as the time for the<br/>
visit. The day came clear and beauti-<br/>
ful. After breakfast they notified him<br/>
that everything was in readiness for<br/>
the contemplated visit to the scene of<br/>
his conflict, his triumph, and his glory.<br/>
-—He informed the gentlemen who had<br/>
notified him, and in a very quiet way,<br/>
that, as it was Sunday, he wished to<br/>
attend church, instead of visiting the<br/>
battle ground that day. The gentlemen<br/>
of the committee were duly informed<br/>
of this, and a consultation was had. As<br/>
all the arrangements had been made<br/>
for that day, and everything ready,<br/>
they concluded to wait upon the Gen-<br/>
eral in a body and tell him of the cir-<br/>
cumstances, and hint that it would look<br/>
strange and sound odd, if not Puritan-<br/>
ic, for him to refuse compliance with<br/>
their wishes. This was done. The<br/>
General listened to what they had to<br/>
say, and then, turning his keen black<br/>
eyes upon them, which sparkled again<br/>
with a little of their old fire, he replied<br/>
with quiet dignity : "Gentlemen, this<br/>
is Sunday, and I have already informed<br/>
you that I am going to church." The<br/>
committee subsided, rather pleased<br/>
than otherwise with the response of<br/>
the old hero. "What fools we were,"<br/>
some one said as the committee retired,<br/>
"to try to change the determination of<br/>
Old Hickory after he had once made<br/>
up his mind."—Louisville Journal.

In resuming our reply to our royal<br/>
antagonist we hope not to weary our<br/>
readers again by another four columned<br/>
editorial at any single sitting. As we<br/>
have to do now only with the latter<br/>
part of his objections as published in<br/>
“The Recorder” of the 18th ulto, we<br/>
think we can make tolerably quick<br/>
work of them; but there is no saying<br/>
for certainty how great a flood a little<br/>
breaking of the dam may produce.

The Goliath who confronts us seems<br/>
to regard it as a crushing objection to<br/>
the authenticity of the Bible that the<br/>
preachers of its doctrines are not able<br/>
to show any of the miraculous power<br/>
which the Bible claims to have been<br/>
exercised by the Lord Jesus and His<br/>
apostles, and that believers of the gos-<br/>
pel of Christ from that time to this<br/>
have had no power to save any of their<br/>
dear friends from death or even from<br/>
any of the common diseases and conse-<br/>
quent sorrows of life. Had the fol-<br/>
lowers of Christ but shown during these<br/>
1800 years of the Christian era some<br/>
such power, even though it were only<br/>
exerted over but two or three of the<br/>
great calamities to which man is heir<br/>
“would not,” he enquires, “the whole<br/>
world by this time have entered the<br/>
christian religion”? Such as we under-<br/>
stand it, is the spirit of his objection.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Most certainly he is far out of the<br/>
way in supposing, that in order to prove<br/>
the authenticity of a book, and sub-<br/>
stantiate the record it gives, the same ev-<br/>
idences which established its authentici-<br/>
ty at the first must be reiterated and reim-<br/>
pressed upon the book and on its teach-<br/>
ers year by year. When and where in all<br/>
the world’s history has ever before such a<br/>
demand been made? Did ever any of the<br/>
great and learned men of the Eastern or<br/>
Western world require that any history<br/>
of individuals or nations should be<br/>
substantiated by miraculous power,<br/>
much less that such power should ever<br/>
attend all who believe in it? Does the<br/>
king of Siam ever deny the authenti-<br/>
city of the Buddhist Scriptures be-<br/>
cause the present race of “ignorant”<br/>
Priests have no power to work such<br/>
wonders as those sacred books affirm that<br/>
Buddh and his immediate followers<br/>
wrought?
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We are persuaded that the king,<br/>
of Siam, even with all his love of the<br/>
marvellous in the Buddhist religion,<br/>
conjoined with the great amount of in-<br/>
telligence he possesses, can have no con-<br/>
fidence in the records of the more-<br/>
modern Buddhist miracles like those<br/>
which are said to have been wrought<br/>
by Nai Pan at Paris in the middle of<br/>
the 17th century. We know positively<br/>
that many of the most learned and<br/>
staunch Buddhists in Siam are ashamed<br/>
of that record. And why? Because<br/>
they know that there is not a word of<br/>
proof to be found of it among all the<br/>
records of the French. Now if our<br/>
antagonist persist in rejecting the Bible<br/>
and hence the christian religion be-<br/>
cause its modern teachers possess not<br/>
the power of miracles, then to be con-<br/>
sistent, he should reject the Buddhist<br/>
scriptures and the Buddhist religion<br/>
as unworthy of confidence. Ought<br/>
he not then to concede that this, ano-<br/>
ther of his strong batteries against the<br/>
Bible, has been silenced simply by our<br/>
little blunderbuss of common sense?
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Here we might safely drop the argu-<br/>
ment. But we fancy that our advocate of<br/>
Buddhism will turn upon us and say,<br/>
that though Buddhism has not been<br/>
substantiated by miracles since the<br/>
time of Buddh, yet it is as strong in<br/>
that regard as christianity. By no<br/>
means would be our reply. We defy<br/>
any friend of Buddhism to produce a<br/>
word of authentic history showing that<br/>
Buddh and his immediate followers<br/>
ever wrought any miracles. There is<br/>
not a word of profane, collateral, or<br/>
concurrent history of the time when<br/>
Buddh lived—about 2500 years since,<br/>
that makes the least credible allusion<br/>
to any miraculous powers which it is<br/>
supposed he possessed. If he did in-<br/>
deed live in Bengal, or Ceylon, or any<br/>
where in that region of the world, a<br/>
contemporary of Daniel the prophet,<br/>
how is it that no proof of the wonders<br/>
he wrought can be found in other<br/>
histories outside of the Buddhist Scrip-<br/>
tures?
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
But with regard to the history<br/>
of Christ and his apostles as given in<br/>
the New Testament there is a great<br/>
amount of concurrent and collateral<br/>
testimony outside of church history,<br/>
wholly independent of the Bible, show-<br/>
ing beyond all reasonable doubt that<br/>
the record is indeed and in truth a<br/>
statement of facts. And much of this<br/>
outside evidence comes not only from<br/>
those who neglected Christ, but from<br/>
such as positively hated him. Their<br/>
words and their writings have been<br/>
over-ruled by the Most High, wholly<br/>
without their intention, for substanti-<br/>
ating the christian religion which they<br/>
aimed to destroy. A great mass of<br/>
such concurrent testimony to the truth-<br/>
fulness of the New Testament could<br/>
we cite, but our time and space will<br/>
not now admit of it. Should it however,<br/>
be demanded, we will hold ourselves<br/>
ready to give it.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
A grand design of the God of the<br/>
Bible was to make a book replete with<br/>
all that was needed to render it worthy<br/>
of the implicit confidence of mankind<br/>
as coming from the Most High, and<br/>
intended by Him for man's only infa-<br/>
llible guide to the knowledge and faith<br/>
of Him as his maker, preserver, and<br/>
redeemer. To this end God, in the<br/>
plenitude of His mercy, determined<br/>
to set upon it the seal of miracles, His<br/>
own peculiar seal, which no man or<br/>
devil could counterfeit or break. For<br/>
the accomplishment of this object, it<br/>
was necessary, that miraculous power<br/>
should be given occasionally to the<br/>
persons whom He honored as His ser-<br/>
vants in preparing the Book for the<br/>
great mission He had appointed for it.<br/>
Having thus stamped every leaf of the<br/>
Bible with this divine signet as no<br/>
other book had ever or will ever be<br/>
honored, God sent it forth on its mis-<br/>
sion as being a complete instrument<br/>
under the divine Spirit for "making<br/>
men wise unto salvation." It would<br/>
seem that in the divine mind there was<br/>
no more need after that, that He should<br/>
grant signs and wonders and miracul-<br/>
ous power to His followers, for the<br/>
Bible had been completed, and made<br/>
the most ancient and authentic book<br/>
of history—-a perfect book of faith<br/>
and practice-—a complete directory to<br/>
a lost world for finding the true God<br/>
and eternal life. Hence it would seem<br/>
reasonable to conclude a priori that<br/>
not only the gift of miracles but also<br/>
that of prophecy would be withheld<br/>
from the teachers of Christianity about<br/>
the time of the completion of the Bi-<br/>
ble; and such appears to have been<br/>
the fact. And how suitable and wise<br/>
and good does it appear in the divine<br/>
author of the Bible that it should be<br/>
so? Who can have any good reason<br/>
for complaining because God has thus<br/>
shut up the world and the church to<br/>
the Bible as it is, and to the teaching<br/>
of His Holy Spirit by it? Having a<br/>
perfect chart of the seas to all parts of<br/>
the world what do Siamese mariners<br/>
now need more in navigating them<br/>
than good teachers of navigation and<br/>
a careful and diligent attention to<br/>
their charts. Abundant proofs of their<br/>
correctness will appear in following<br/>
them. In like manner, having a com-<br/>
plete Bible, a book of divine make,<br/>
impressed from beginning to end with<br/>
the most extraordinary seals of divi-<br/>
nity, and with the Almighty and all<br/>
wise Spirit ever attending it, and ever<br/>
ready to teach most effectually all who<br/>
ask Him for teaching, what need we<br/>
now of more signs and wonders than<br/>
the Bible gives us? Divine wisdom<br/>
speaks to the world now as it did to the<br/>
rich man in his agony, "If they hear<br/>
not Moses and the prophets neither<br/>
will they be persuaded through one<br/>
rose from the dead."

Our champion is quite mistaken in<br/>
supposing that men would be conver-<br/>
ted to Christ by the power of mirac-<br/>
les. Miracles have never had such an<br/>
influence. In Old Testament times<br/>
they never converted a single heathen<br/>
to the love and service of Jehovah.<br/>
Those miracles performed by Moses<br/>
in Egypt never converted one of her<br/>
rulers or even a common person from<br/>
idolatry. Not one of the hundreds who<br/>
gave their hearts to Jesus and follow-<br/>
ed Him in the days of His personal<br/>
ministry, nor one of the 3000 con-<br/>
verted to Christ on the day of Penta-<br/>
cost were made willing to follow Him<br/>
by the power of the miracles which<br/>
they saw Him and the apostles per-<br/>
form. But it was alone by the effectual<br/>
teaching of the Almighty Spirit of God,<br/>
through the preaching of the truths<br/>
of the Bible that the hearts of men<br/>
were then drawn unto Jesus; and<br/>
such is the power which it pleases<br/>
God now to employ as his own chosen<br/>
and unchangeable plan for converting<br/>
the world. Had the Lord Jesus been<br/>
personally present with all the preach-<br/>
ers of the gospel from the beginning<br/>
until now, and had given them all the<br/>
power of miracles that he gave to the<br/>
apostles, there is no good reason to<br/>
think that His gospel would have<br/>
made greater aggressions upon heath-<br/>
enism than it has done. For as in<br/>
Paul's time "it pleased God by the<br/>
foolishness of preaching to save them<br/>
that believe" so has it ever since, and<br/>
so doubtless it ever will be. "The gos-<br/>
pel of Christ", not miracles, "is the<br/>
power of God unto salvation unto<br/>
every one that believeth"—that is unto<br/>
every one who credits the Bible as be-<br/>
ing indeed and in truth the infallible<br/>
word of God and acts consistently with<br/>
such credence.

{{< news/text >}}
In the reign of P'râbât Sómdêtch<br/>
P'ra Pooti-yâwtfa Choola-loke, Sóm-<br/>
dêtch P'ra-chow p'eenang the young-<br/>
er of his elder sisters gave birth to<br/>
three sons. The first was born in the<br/>
year of the cock, 3d of the decade,<br/>
civil era 1163—-Christian era 1801,<br/>
and became a Chôwfa following his<br/>
mother, but he died in that same year.<br/>
The 2d son was born in the year of<br/>
the rat, 6th of the decade, civil era 1166,<br/>
Christian era 1804. The 3d son was<br/>
born in the year of the great dragon,<br/>
10th of the decade, civil era 1170<br/>
—-Christian era 1808. Both of these<br/>
royal sons became Chôwfas following<br/>
their royal mother. The 2nd king of<br/>
that reign deceased in the year of the<br/>
hog, the 5th of the decade, civil era<br/>
1165—Christian era 1803. In the<br/>
year of the rabbit, 9th of the decade<br/>
civil era 1167, the king was pleased<br/>
to promote Sómdêtch P'ráchôw lǒǒk<br/>
t'o the elder, to the honor and power<br/>
of 2nd king. The two sons of this<br/>
2nd king, one of them bora be-<br/>
fore his father was promoted to the<br/>
throne of the Wangna, and the other<br/>
after his promotion, were both titled<br/>
Sómdêtch P'ráchôwlan t'õ Chôwfa.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
P'râbât Sómdêtch P'ra-pôôti-yâwt-<br/>
fa Choolaloke had a daughter whose<br/>
mother was a child of the Rajáh of<br/>
Weang Chân. (a Laos king). This<br/>
daughter the king promoted only to<br/>
the rank of P'râong-Chôw, being the<br/>
same in rank as his sons, and royal<br/>
daughters by P'râsânôms (inferior<br/>
wives). The mother of that royal<br/>
daughter died in the year of the hog,<br/>
5th of the decade. When the 2nd king<br/>
died she was five years of age a moth-<br/>
erless orphan, and hence the king felt<br/>
a great tenderness for the child. One<br/>
year after this, this little princess follow-<br/>
ed her royal sire down to the landing to<br/>
see the Lawe k'Atôngs (fireworks on<br/>
the River) While running and sporting<br/>
on the brink of the water, she fell in,<br/>
and was for a little time lost. All pre-<br/>
sent were in a great state of alarm and<br/>
excitement, seeking for the child. It<br/>
was but a few minutes, however, when<br/>
she was found grasping the stalk of<br/>
a plantain tree, and hence had not<br/>
sunk into the water. They who found<br/>
her very carefully conducted her back<br/>
to her royal father. For this reason<br/>
the king had still more compassion for<br/>
the child, and issued a royal proclam-<br/>
ation, saying, that the mother of this<br/>
princess is a Laosian princess, and<br/>
a blood relative of the present Rá-<br/>
jáh of Weang Chân. It is therefore<br/>
suitable that she should be promoted<br/>
to the honor of Sómdêtch P'ráchôw lǒǒk<br/>
t'o Chôwfa. There has been no festi-<br/>
val for a Chôwfa Sókân since the be-<br/>
ginning of this reign. When this<br/>
Princess shall attain to the suitable<br/>
age for receiving such honors, it shall<br/>
be my pleasure to bestow them upon<br/>
her, and thus transmit the custom on-<br/>
ward in the future. Having thus de-<br/>
clared his will, the king then gave her<br/>
the name engraved on a gold plate or<br/>
sheet—-Sómdêtch P'ráchôw lǒǒk t'o<br/>
Chôwfa-kôôn-t'ôn-t'ip-wâdee. That<br/>
Princess Chôwfa, when she reached<br/>
the eleventh year of her age in the<br/>
year of the great dragon, civil era 1170,<br/>
Christian era 1808, had attained to the<br/>
proper time for receiving the honors<br/>
of the Sókân. At that time Princess<br/>
Chôwfa P'int'awâdee, who had had the<br/>
care and honor of handing the royal<br/>
Sókân custom down to the succeeding<br/>
generation, had been dead seven years.<br/>
Nevertheless there was remaining a<br/>
complete copy of the ceremonies of<br/>
the original Sókân, which Princess<br/>
Chôwfa P'int'awâdee had committed<br/>
to writing, and there were also many<br/>
persons then living who had been well<br/>
versed in all that concerned the festi-<br/>
val, and remembered accurately all a-<br/>
bout it, and had been eye witnesses<br/>
of the Sókân ceremonies on three sev-<br/>
eral instances in the palace of the 2nd<br/>
king. These persons were therefore<br/>
appointed to prepare for the forth-<br/>
coming Sókân, by the royal command<br/>
that it should be of the highest grade<br/>
according to the pattern, not wanting<br/>
in the least. The preparations were<br/>
made in the P’râmaḣâprasât being sim-<br/>
ilar to the royal festival on New year’s<br/>
holidays. There was the artificial<br/>
mount called Krielât and all the Râchâ-<br/>
wâts, the golden and silvered five and<br/>
seven storied châts or standards stand-<br/>
ing on either side of the way of the<br/>
procession, together with all kinds of<br/>
accompanying plays of the highest<br/>
order. There were persons who car-<br/>
ried peacock’s feathers before the<br/>
Princess, women carrying all her in-<br/>
signia of royalty. In the rear, were<br/>
women of the bath, a procession clothed<br/>
in white escorting the Princess to hear<br/>
preaching by the Buddhist priests,<br/>
and prayers and incantations on three<br/>
successive days. On the morning of<br/>
the fourth day there was a grand pro-<br/>
cession to the place of hair cutting,<br/>
and then the Prince ascended the<br/>
mount Krielât and being there arrayed<br/>
in royal habiliments, was escorted<br/>
down the mount and carried in<br/>
great state encircling the mount three<br/>
times, and then returned into the palace<br/>
before noon. In the p. m. of the same<br/>
day, there was another grand proces-<br/>
sion, all being clothed in red and<br/>
scarlet. Sundry festivities were con-<br/>
tinned on the 5th and the 6th days.<br/>
On the 7th day there was a procession<br/>
for bearing the P’râ kaââ (sacred hair)<br/>
of the Prince down to the river and<br/>
floating it away. This festival of Sô-<br/>
kân for Chôwfa Kôön-t’ôn-tip-yâwâ-<br/>
dee was held in the 4th month of the<br/>
year of the great dragon, the 10th of<br/>
the decade, civil era 1170—Christian<br/>
era 1809.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Six months after that, P’râbât Sôm-<br/>
detch P’râ P’ôöt’i-yâwt’a Chôôlalôke<br/>
deceased. His son P’râ Chôw lûûk t’ô<br/>
the 2nd king acceded to the throne.<br/>
That was the 2nd reign of the present<br/>
dynasty. The two Chôwfas sons of<br/>
the king became Sômde[?] P’râ-<br/>
chow lûûk t’ô. The king, titled P’râ-<br/>
bât Sômde[?] P’râ p’ôôt’i-lôt-lâ-nâp’a-<br/>
lie, held a royal counsel of all his offic-<br/>
ers and nobles concerning the Sókân<br/>
festival, saying that the festival had in-<br/>
deed been recently observed to confer<br/>
the honors of a Chôwfa and would be<br/>
a pattern for the future. But there<br/>
was no ceremony for bathing and for<br/>
conferring the name Chôwfa in full<br/>
accord with olden times when the old<br/>
city of Ayuthia was the capital. The<br/>
elders among the people who witnes-<br/>
sed the ceremony as of old, are now<br/>
aged and are quickly to pass away.<br/>
The old custom will hence be lost. I<br/>
desire to have the ceremony performed<br/>
complete, that it may be for honor<br/>
and glory and a pattern for the time<br/>
to come. The great counsel were un-<br/>
animously in favor of the royal pro-<br/>
position. Accordingly in the year of<br/>
the cock, the 5th of the decade, civil<br/>
era 1175—-Christian era 1813, there<br/>
was an extraordinary Sókân festival<br/>
complete with the bathing rites for<br/>
Somdetch P’râ Chôw lûûk t’ô, Chôw<br/>
the elder. There was made a great<br/>
raft of bamboos at the royal landing.<br/>
A place was made for the bathing in the<br/>
centre of the float. The whole was<br/>
enclosed with a fence of bamboo ban-<br/>
nisters and railing. Within this was a<br/>
wicker-work fence of bamboos, and<br/>
within this still another for the proces-<br/>
sion, and still further in, was a screen<br/>
made of white cloth. There were two<br/>
flights of steps up the mount one on<br/>
either side, one of silver and one of gold.<br/>
There was also another flight lined and<br/>
carpeted with long, white cloth and<br/>
was called bundy kââo, or precious<br/>
steps. In the bathing pool were golden<br/>
cocoanuts and gold and silver prawns.<br/>
These were floating in all parts of the<br/>
pool. Within that enclosure on the<br/>
great raft were ranged all the gold<br/>
and silver standards of royalty, in three<br/>
circles about the premises. Over all<br/>
there was stationed the royal guard<br/>
with armed boats surrounding the Sô-<br/>
kan raft, which was to serve in the<br/>
place of the mount Krei lat.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Other things besides those already<br/>
mentioned were chiefly displayed in<br/>
the P’râmaḣâ-prasât, with a proces-<br/>
sions by the streets, and theatrical<br/>
performances precisely like the origi-<br/>
nal Sokan. There was a procession<br/>
all dressed in white escorting the prince<br/>
to hear preaching by the Buddhist<br/>
priests in the P’râmaḣâ-prasât on<br/>
three successive days. On the 4th day<br/>
there was a procession to escort the<br/>
prince to the royal landing to bathe in<br/>
the place prepared, on the royal raft<br/>
representing mount Krei-lat.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
After the ceremonies of the bathing<br/>
were over, the prince was escorted back<br/>
into the Pràmahá-prà-ât who re-<br/>
ceived his title engraved on a gold<br/>
plate which was, Somdetch Prá-<br/>
chôw-lôôkt'ô Chôwfa Mongkut sóm-<br/>
má-ti-wongs p'ongs itaswárá krá-<br/>
atriyá kátíyá rachá kooman. In the<br/>
afternoon of the same day the prince<br/>
was paraded in a royal procession all<br/>
dressed in red and scarlet, himself clad<br/>
in the highest state to a royal throne<br/>
called Amarin-tara-winít-chí, where<br/>
he passed through the T'ám-quan<br/>
ceremonies, (that is forms for enduing<br/>
the child with fortitude,) at which time<br/>
magnificent presents were made to the<br/>
prince. On the two following days<br/>
there were a variety of performances<br/>
which put a complete finish upon that<br/>
festival occasion.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Having closed the ceremonies, the<br/>
king made a speech in which he said,<br/>
this royal custom of Sokán shall be<br/>
performed only once on the Chowfa,<br/>
which will be sufficient to transmit it<br/>
down to the coming generation, so that<br/>
this ancient festival shall not be lost,<br/>
because it is a custom indispensable<br/>
for all the Chowfa princes. There is<br/>
no necessity that it should ever be re-<br/>
peated on the same person, as the com-<br/>
mon people sometimes repeat the com-<br/>
mon ceremony for the top-knot cutting<br/>
on their children. They do it because<br/>
they feel in haste to come into<br/>
possession of the money which they<br/>
receive in presents for their children at<br/>
such times. For this reason they will<br/>
sometimes have the ceremony of T'am-<br/>
quan performed before they have the<br/>
top-knot cut, making two distinct sea-<br/>
sons of it. But in regard to the kings<br/>
of Siam, they have no occasion to be<br/>
in haste to get such presents, and<br/>
hence the whole of the ceremony is<br/>
grouped together in one. It is a cus-<br/>
tom for which there is a stern neces-<br/>
sity that it should be preserved.

In the year of the rat, the 8th of<br/>
the decade, civil era 1178 in the month<br/>
of March, christian era 1817 there was<br/>
another Chowfa Sokán for Somdetch<br/>
P'rá-chôw-lôôk-t'ô Chowfa Mongkut<br/>
(the present king of Siam) an extra-<br/>
ordinary festival equal in splendor<br/>

We clip the following from the GA-<br/>
LIGNANI'S MESSENGER, Paris, Nov. 1st 1865.<br/>
It shows clearly enough how all sensible<br/>
European observers must regard the<br/>
extraordinary conduct to which allusion is<br/>
made: ED.

A circumstance of a most extraor-<br/>
dinary character in connection with<br/>
the relations existing between the<br/>
French Consul at Bangkok-—the Siam-<br/>
ese capital—-and the KING OF SIAM<br/>
will be found narrated in another<br/>
column. Space unfortunately is not<br/>
at our command sufficient to give the<br/>
full details as they appear in the re-<br/>
spectable English Journal published<br/>
at Bangkok itself, enough will appear<br/>
in our epitome to show that the con-<br/>
duct of the French Consul has been<br/>
apparently grossly reprehensible, and<br/>
certainly very far removed from that<br/>
far-famed politesse which has hitherto<br/>
been the pride and the characteristic<br/>
of French diplomacy. We cannot<br/>
doubt that the Imperial Government<br/>
will both disavow the acts, and repri-<br/>
mand the behaviour of its official, as<br/>
soon as the matter comes fully and<br/>
officially under its notice.

The weather
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The month was ushered in by re-<br/>
markably warm days for the season,<br/>
the wind having shifted from the N.<br/>
and N. E. to the South, which point of<br/>
the compass it is held until it brought<br/>
us, on the early morning of the 4th, a<br/>
powerful rain of 7 hours. Early in the<br/>
evening of the same day it commenced<br/>
raining again, and continued till late<br/>
in the morning of the 5th. It is a rare<br/>
occurrence even in the wet season to<br/>
witness half as many hours of contin-<br/>
ued rain. It was withal a wonderfully<br/>
cold rain, the wind being northerly.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The rain had doubtless come from the<br/>
South in an upper current of clouds and<br/>
was driven back upon us by the North<br/>
wind in an under current. A very un-<br/>
common amount of water fell for the<br/>
season, and it is reported that large<br/>
quantities of rice at the North, lying in<br/>
scattered bundels in the fields, has been<br/>
destroyed by it. Yet there is little<br/>
fear that this will seriously effect the<br/>
market as the general crop is so abund-<br/>
ant.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The farmers had made no calculation<br/>
for such a powerful rain. They had, it<br/>
is true, always expected one or two gen-<br/>
eral showers about the middle of Jan.<br/>
and Febr.: but never any so drenching<br/>
and prolonged as to injure much, any<br/>
rice that might still be in the field.<br/>
Indeed in the usual course of the sea-<br/>
sons the rice is all gathered and thresh-<br/>
ed by the middle of January. But<br/>
the last crop was very remarkable for<br/>
being too late by at least a month.<br/>
Consequently the harvesting of it was<br/>
equally behind the usual time. The<br/>
showers of rain which fell in January<br/>
were so light as scarcely to wet the<br/>
earth to the depth of an eighth of an<br/>
inch. Hence the reaped rice in great<br/>
quantities, then scattered over the fields<br/>
were not at all injured by it. But the<br/>
Febr. rain was not only uncommonly<br/>
drenching, but also came ten days sooner<br/>
than is usual, and found the farmers in<br/>
some quarters quite unprepared for it<br/>
as above stated.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We have been informed by very<br/>
reliable natives, that there seems to be<br/>
in this change of the seasons an essay<br/>
of nature to return to the good old<br/>
fashion times, a score of years ago or<br/>
more, when the February rains came<br/>
earlier than of late years and more<br/>
abundant, and when the threshing of<br/>
rice was all over. Hence those rains<br/>
were denominated fon eh'a-lan—liter-<br/>
ally rain for soaking threshing floors.<br/>
Such drenching rains were then re-<br/>
garded as the joyful harbingers of a<br/>
forth coming bountiful harvest. We<br/>
are quite glad to perceive that the peo-<br/>
ple, so far from being alarmed by the<br/>
great amount and unseasonableness of<br/>
this rain, regard it, as their fathers did<br/>
similar rains, with lively hope of " a<br/>
good time coming." The reader will<br/>
not fail to remember, that threshing<br/>
floors in Siam, as in Old Testament<br/>
times, are in the open fields, and on<br/>
the bare earth."

There are now in Bangkok three<br/>
Steam mills for hulling rice, running<br/>
night and day. The first in order<br/>
of establishment is the Am. Steam<br/>
Mill under the management of F.<br/>
Blake,—-M. Gurvey Superintendent.<br/>
The second is the Bangkok Rice Mill<br/>
Company under the management of<br/>
A. M. Odman. The third is A. Mark-<br/>
wald & Co's Steam Rice Mill, Super-<br/>
intended by P. Littlejohn.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
The 1st is said to turn out 1000<br/>
piculs daily. The 2nd, 1600 or more,<br/>
and the 3d, 900. We have examined<br/>
the quality of their work and are<br/>
pleased to see that they are about<br/>
equally good, and all far better than<br/>
the natives hull their rice by their<br/>
hand-mills. The native mode breaks<br/>
the kernel very much, the European<br/>
mode but little.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
If we have been correctly informed,<br/>
neither of the Steam Mills attempt to<br/>
polish any rice, as that renders the<br/>
grain much more liable to be injured<br/>
by shipment.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We are also pleased to learn that<br/>
the house of Scott & Co. are now<br/>
engaged in erecting a 4th Steam Mill.<br/>
But by an accident which occurred to<br/>
some of the machinery a few days<br/>
since, the work will be delayed, it is<br/>
said, several months.

H. M. S. Coquette, which left on<br/>
Tuesday morning last, arrived here on<br/>
the 31st of January bringing up Thomas<br/>
George Knox Esq. H. B. M. Consul<br/>
from Singapore. During her stay here<br/>
the Captain and officers accompanied<br/>
H. B. M. Consul to a private audience<br/>
with H. M. the Supreme King to pay<br/>
that respect and sympathy which His<br/>
Majesty’s sad bereavement entitles<br/>
him to receive.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
His Majesty, so we have been in-<br/>
formed, was willing to grant a public<br/>
audience if such had been desired;<br/>
but it was felt that such a proceeding<br/>
would have caused both trouble and<br/>
inconvenience to the King, which in his<br/>
present afflicted state it would not have<br/>
been proper to subject him. On a<br/>
subsequent day the Captain and officers<br/>
were admitted to view the urn which<br/>
now contains the remains of His<br/>
deceased Majesty the Second King.

The officers of H. M. S. Coquette<br/>
were present and a great proportion of<br/>
the Foreign community. The Ball<br/>
room had been very tastefully deco-<br/>
rated; and His Excellency the Prime<br/>
Minister’s Band, which had been very<br/>
kindly lent for the occasion, played<br/>
throughout the evening.

the private secretary of President<br/>
Johnson, and is now succeeded by<br/>
Colonel Robert Johnson, a son of the<br/>

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A NOBLE APPEAL.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We envy neither the head nor the<br/>
heart of the man who can read the<br/>
following extract from an appeal of the<br/>
colored people of Missouri for Equal<br/>
Suffrage without shame for the pre-<br/>
judice which graduates human rights<br/>
according to the color of the skin.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We are forced to pay taxes without<br/>
representation—to submit without ap-<br/>
peal to laws, however offensive, with-<br/>
out a single voice in framing them—-<br/>
to bear arms without the right to say<br/>
whether against friend or foe, against<br/>
loyalty or disloyalty. Without suf-<br/>
frage we are forced in strict subjec-<br/>
tion to a government whose councils<br/>
are to us foreign, and are called by<br/>
our own countrymen to witness a<br/>
violence upon the primary principle of<br/>
a republican government, as gross<br/>
and outrageous as that which justly<br/>
stirred patriot Americans to throw<br/>
overboard the tea from English bot-<br/>
toms in Boston harbor, and to wage<br/>
the war for independence.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We ask not for social equality with<br/>
the white man, as is often claimed by<br/>
the shallow demagogue; for a law<br/>
higher than human must forever<br/>
govern social relations.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We ask only that privilege which<br/>
is now given to the very poorest and<br/>
meanest of white men who come to<br/>
the ballot-box.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We demand this as those who are<br/>
native born citizens of this state, and<br/>
have never known other allegiance<br/>
than to its authority and to these<br/>
United States.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We demand this in the names of<br/>
those whose bitter toil has enriched<br/>
our state and brought wealth to its<br/>
homes.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We demand this as those who have<br/>
ever cheerfully sustained law and order,<br/>
and who have, within our means,<br/>
zealously promoted education and<br/>
morality.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We demand this as those who have<br/>
been true and loyal to our government<br/>
from its foundation to the present, and<br/>
who have never deserted its interests<br/>
while even in the midst of treason and<br/>
under subjugation to its most violent<br/>
enemies.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We demand this in the honored<br/>
name of the nine thousand colored<br/>
troops who, with the first opportunity,<br/>
enlisted under the banner of Missouri<br/>
and bared their breasts to the remor-<br/>
seless storms of treason, and by hun-<br/>
dreds went down to death in the con-<br/>
flict, while the franchised rebel-—the<br/>
cowardly conservative—-the now bit-<br/>
terest enemies to our right to suffrage,<br/>
remained in quiet at home, safe, and<br/>
fattened on the fruits of our sacrifice,<br/>
toil, and blood.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We ask for a citizenship based upon<br/>
a principle so broad and solid that<br/>
upon it black men, white men, and<br/>
every American born can equally, safe-<br/>
ly, and eternally stand.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We ask that the organic law of our<br/>
State shall give to suffrage irrevocable<br/>
guaranties that shall know of no dis-<br/>
tinction at the polls on account of<br/>
color.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
If those guaranties are still to be<br/>
denied, and hereafter color is to mark<br/>
the line which shall be drawn about<br/>
the ballot-box, we ask for a statute<br/>
that shall clearly define the castes and<br/>
grades of complexion which shall be<br/>
permitted within, or expelled from, its<br/>
loyal precincts.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
If wealth is to guard the portals of<br/>
a free suffrage, we ask that our ac-<br/>
quirements be respected and admitted<br/>
to equal representation.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
If intelligence shall prescribe the<br/>
limits, we ask for an impartial dis-<br/>
crimination, which shall affect white<br/>
as well as black, and submit that the<br/>
entire ignorance and stupidity of the<br/>
people should not by any presumption<br/>
be wholly charged to the account of<br/>
ourselves.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
To such an universal test of intel-<br/>
ligence we are willing to submit our<br/>
claims to suffrage, and believe that it<br/>
would promote a most healthy spirit<br/>
of emulation and prove the greatest<br/>
educator of the masses.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
Our asserted ignorance is not a<br/>
condition from choice or disposition,<br/>
as is now everywhere made evident<br/>
in the zealous efforts of our people to<br/>
educate themselves and their children;<br/>
but arises from the black code legis-<br/>
lation of our illiterate franchised mas-<br/>
ters.
{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}
We ask that colored loyalty, indus-<br/>
try, and intelligence shall receive as<br/>
full rights, guaranties, and privileges<br/>
as those accorded to white treason,<br/>
arrogance, and indolence.
