Knocking! Ever Knocking!
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
BY MRS. HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
"Behold, I stand at the door and knock."
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}Knocking, knocking, ever knocking!

{{< news/indent3 >}}Who is there?

{{< news/indent1 >}}'Tis a pilgrim, strange and kingly,

{{< news/indent3 >}}Never such was seen before—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Ah, sweet soul, for such a wonder,

{{< news/indent3 >}}Undo the door.

{{< news/indent1 >}}No-—that door is hard to open;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Hinges rusty, latch is broken;

{{< news/indent3 >}}Bid Him go.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Wherefore, with that knocking dreary

{{< news/indent3 >}}Scare the sleep from one so weary?

{{< news/indent3 >}}Say Him—no.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Knocking, knocking, ever knocking!

{{< news/indent3 >}}What! Still there?

{{< news/indent1 >}}O, sweet soul, but once behold Him,

{{< news/indent1 >}}With the glory-crowned hair;

{{< news/indent1 >}}And those eyes so strange and tender,

{{< news/indent3 >}}Waiting there;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Open! Open! Once behold Him,

{{< news/indent3 >}}Him, so fair.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Ah, that door! Why wilt Thou vex me,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Coming over to perplex me?

{{< news/indent1 >}}For the key is stiffly rusty,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And the bolt is clogged and dusty;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Many—fingered ivy vine

{{< news/indent1 >}}Seals it fast with twist and twine;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Weeds of years and years before,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Choke the passage of that door.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Knocking! Knocking! What! Still knocking!

{{< news/indent3 >}}He still there?

{{< news/indent1 >}}What's the hour? The night is waning—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}In my heart a dread complaining,

{{< news/indent3 >}}And a chilly sad unrest!

{{< news/indent1 >}}Ah, this knocking! It disturbs me,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Scares my sleep with dreams unblest!

{{< news/indent3 >}}Give me rest,

{{< news/indent3 >}}Rest-—ah, rest!

{{< news/indent1 >}}Rest, dear soul, He longs to give thee;

{{< news/indent1 >}}Thou hast only dreamed of pleasure,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Dreamed of gifts and golden treasure,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Dreamed of jewels in thy keeping,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Waked to weariness of weeping—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Open to thy soul's one Lover,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And thy night of dreams is over—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}The true gift He brings have seeming

{{< news/indent1 >}}More than all thy faded dreaming!

{{< news/indent1 >}}Did she open? Doth she? Will she?

{{< news/indent1 >}}So, as wondering we behold,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Grows a picture to a sign

{{< news/indent1 >}}Pressed upon your soul and mine;

{{< news/indent1 >}}For in every breast that liveth

{{< news/indent1 >}}Is that strange mysterious door;

{{< news/indent1 >}}The forsaken and betangled,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Ivy-gnarled and weed-bejangled,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Dusty, rusty and forgotten—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}There the pierced hand still knocketh,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And with ever patient watching.

{{< news/indent1 >}}With the sad eyes true and tender,

{{< news/indent1 >}}With the glory-crowned hair—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Still a God is waiting there.

The Appeal of the loyal men
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
OF THE SOUTH TO THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS
OF THE UNITED STATES.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The representatives of eight millions of Ame-
rican citizens appeal for protection and justice
to their friends and brothers in the states that
have been spared the cruelties of the rebellion
and the direct horrors of civil war. Here, on
the spot where freedom was proffered and
pledged by the fathers of the Republic, we
implore your help against a reorganized op-
pression, whose sole object is to remit the
control of our destinies to the contrivers of the
rebellion, after they have been vanquished in
honorable battle; thus at once to punish us
for our devotion to our country and to entrench
themselves in the official fortifications of the
government. Others have related the thrill-
ing story of our wrongs from reading and
observation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We come before you as another, God witness
and speak from personal knowledge and
experience. If you fail us we are more
utterly deserted and betrayed, than if the con-
test had been decided against us; for, in that
case, even victorious slavery would have found
profit in the speedy pardon of those who had
been among its bravest foes. Unexpected per-
fidy in the highest place of the government,
accidentally filled by one who adds cruelty to
ingratitude, and forgives the guilty as he
persecutes the innocent, has stimulated the
almost extinguished revenge of the beaten
conspirators, and now the rebels who offered
to yield everything to save their own lives,
are seeking to consign us to bloody graves.
Where we expected a benefactor we find a
persecutor. Having lost our champion we
return to you, who can make presidents and
punish traitors. Our last hope under God is
the unity and firmness of the States that elect-
ed Abraham Lincoln and defeated Jefferson
Davis. The best statement of our case is the
appalling yet unconscious confession of And-
rew Johnson, who in savage hatred of his own
record proclaims his purpose to clothe the four
millions of traitors with the power to im-
poverish and degrade eight millions of loyal
men. Our wrongs bear alike on all races, and
our tyrants, unchecked by you, will award
the same fate to white and black. We can
remain as we are only as inferiors and victims.
We may fly from our houses, but we should
fear to trust our fate with those who, after
denouncing and defeating traitors, refused to
right those who have bravely assisted them in
the good work. Till we are wholly rescued,
there is neither peace for you nor prosperity
for us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We cannot better define at once our wrongs
and our wants than by declaring that since
Andrew Johnson affiliated with his early slan-
derers and our constant enemies, his hand
has been laid heavily upon every earnest
loyalist in the South. History, the just judg-
ment of the present, and the certain consummation
of the future, invite and command us to
declare:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That, after rejecting his own remedies for
restoring the Union, he has resorted to the
weapons of traitors to bruise and beat down
patriots;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That after declaring that none but the loyal
should govern the reconstructed South, he has
practised upon the maxim that none but
traitors shall rule;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That while in the North he has removed
conscientious men from office, and filled many
of the vacancies with the sympathizers of trea-
son, in the South he has removed the proved
and trusted patriot and selected the equally
proved and convicted traitor;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That, after brave men, who had fought for
the old flag, have been nominated for posi-
tions, their names have been recalled and
avowed rebels substituted;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That every original Unionist in the South,
who stands fast to Andrew Johnson's coven-
ants from 1861 to 1865, has been ostracized;
that he has corrupted the local courts by offer-
ing premiums for the defiance of the laws of
Congress and by openly discouraging the ob-
servance of the oath against treason; that
while refusing to punish one single conspicu-
ous traitor, though thousands had earned the
penalty of death, more than a thousand of
devoted Union citizens have been murdered in
cold blood since the surrender of Lee; and in
no case have their assassins been brought to
judgment; that he has pardoned some of the
worst of the rebel criminals north and south,
including some who have taken human life
under circumstances of unparalleled atrocity;
that while denouncing and fettering the opera-
tions of the Freedmen's Bureau, he with full
knowledge of the falsehood, has charged that
the black men are lazy and rebellious, and has
concealed the fact that more whites than blacks
have been protected and fed by that noble
organization; and that while declaring that it
was corruptly managed and expensive to the
government, he has connived at a system of
profligacy in the use of the public patronage
and public money, wholly without parallel,
save when the traitors bankrupted the Treas-
ury and sought to disorganize and scatter the
army and the navy, only to make it more easy
to capture the government;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That while declaring against the injustice of
leaving eleven states unrepresented, he has
refused to authorize the liberal plan of Con-
gress, simply because it recognizes the loyal
majority and refuses to perpetuate the traitor
minority;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That in every state south of Mason and
Dixon's line his “policy” has wrought the
most deplorable consequences, social, moral
and political. It has emboldened returned
rebels to threaten civil war in Maryland, Mis-
souri, West Virginia and Tennessee, unless
the patriots who saved and sealed these states
to the old flag surrender before the arrogant
demand. It has corrupted high state officials
elected by Union men and sworn to enforce
the laws against rebels, and made
them the mere instruments of the authors of
the rebellion. It has encouraged a new alien-
ation between the sections, and by impeding
emigration to the South has created a favor-
able barrier to free and friendly inter-
course in the North and West. It has allowed
the rebel soldiery to persecute the members of
the colored schools and to burn the churches
in which the freedmen here worshipped the
living God. This a system so barbarous
should have culminated in the frightful riot at
Memphis, and the still more appalling mas-
sacre at New Orleans, was as natural as that
a bloody war should now be impending as the
rule of John C. Calhoun and Jefferson Davis. An-
drew Johnson is responsible for all these un-
speakable cruelties, and he provoked and
sustained and applauded them, sending his agents
and emissaries into this woful land to excite
republicans to initiate new outrages; his reckless
policy to put upon a Southern people. He fur-
ther says that those persons who were at the insur-
rection against the Constitution were not
only denied to the free people of New Orleans
who on the 30th of July, when they assembled to
discuss how best to protect themselves; but
denied admittance to the slaughter of hundreds of in-
nocent men.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}No page in the record of his recent outrages
upon human justice and constitutional law is
more revolting than that which convicts him
of refusing to arrest the preparations for that
savage carnival, and not only of refusing to
punish its authors, but of toiling to throw the
guilty responsibility upon unoffending and in-
nocent freedmen. The infatuated tyrant that
stood ready to crush his own people in Tennes-
see when they were struggling to maintain a
government erected by himself, against his
and other traitors' persecutions, was even
more eager to illustrate his savage policy by
clothing with the most despotic power the
rioters of New Orleans.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Notwithstanding this heartless desertion
and cruel persecution by Andrew Johnson,
the states of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Western Virginia, Maryland and Delaware,
imbued with democratic republican principles
—principles which the fathers of the republic
designed for all America, are now making
determined battle with the enemies of free
constitutional government, and by the bles-
sing of God these states will soon range them-
selves in line with the former free states, and
illustrate the wisdom and beneficence of the
great charter of American liberty by their in-
creasing population, wealth and prosperity in
the remaining ten states. The seeds of oligar-
chy, planted in the Constitution by its slavery
feature, have grown to be a monstrous power,
whose recognition thus wrung from these re-
luctant framers of that great instrument enabl-
ed these states to entrench themselves behind
the perverted doctrine of states rights, and
sheltered by a claim of constitutional obliga-
tion to maintain slavery in the states to present
to the American government the alternatives
of oligarchy with slavery, or democratic-re-
publican governments without slavery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}   A forbearing government, bowing to a sup-
posed constitutional behest, acquiesced in the
former alternative. The hand of the govern-
ment was stayed for eighty years. The prin-
ciples of constitutional liberty languished for
want of government support. Oligarchy matur-
ed its power with subtle design. Its history
for eighty years is replete with unparalleled
injuries and usurpations; it developed only
the agricultural localities geographically dis-
tinct from the free labor localities, and less
than one third of the whole with African slav-
es. It held four millions of human beings as
chattels, yet made them the basis of unjust
power for themselves in federal and state go-
vernments. To maintain their enslavement it
excluded millions of free white laborers from
the richest agricultural lands of the world,
forced them to remain inactive and unproduc-
tive on the mineral, manufacturing and lum-
ber localities comprising two-thirds of the
whole South in square miles and real un-
developed wealth, simply because the localities
were agriculturally too poor for slave labor,
and condemned them to agriculture on this
unagricultural territory, and consigned them
to unwilling ignorance and poverty by deny-
ing capital and strangling enterprise. It re-
pelled the capital, energy, will, and skill of
the free states from the free labor localities
by unmitigated intolerance and proscription,
thus guarding the approaches to their slave
domain against democracy. Statute books
groaned under despotic laws against unlawful
and insurrectionary assemblies aimed at the
constitutional guaranties of the right to pea-
ceably assemble and petition for redress of
grievances. It nullified constitutional guaran-
ties of freedom and free speech and a free press.
It deprived citizens of the other states of their
privileges and immunities in the states-—an
injury and usurpation, alike unjust to northern
citizens and destructive of the best interests
of the states themselves. Alarmed at the
progress of democracy in the face of every
discouragement, at last it sought immunity
by secession and war. The heart sickens with
contemplation of the four years that followed,
forced loans, impressments,conscriptions with
bloody hands and bayonets; the number of
aged Union men who had long laid aside the
implements of labor, but who had been sum-
moned anew to the field by the conscription of
their sons to support their children and grand-
children; reduced from comfort on the verge
of starvation; the slaughter of noble youths,
types of physical manhood, forced into an
unholy war against those with whom they
were identified by every interest; long months
of incarceration in rebel bastiles; banishment
from homes and hearthstones, are but a par-
tial recital of the long catalogue of horrors.
But democrats, North and South combined,
defeated them. They lost. What did they
lose? The cause of oligarchy? They lost
African slavery by name only. Soon as the
tocsin of war ceased-—soon as the clang of
arms was hushed, they raise the cry of imme-
diate admission, and with that watchword
seek to organize under new forms a contest to
perpetuate their undrilled sway. They re-
habilitate with them sweeping control of all
local and state organizations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The federal Executive, easily seduced,
yields a willing obedience to his old mas-
ters. Aided by his unscrupulous disregard
of Constitution and laws, by his merciless
proscription of true democratic opinion,
and by all his appliances of despotic power,
they now defiantly enter the lists in the
loyal North, and seek to wring from free-
men an endorsment of their wicked designs.
Every foul agency is at work to accomplish
this result. Falsely protesting to assent
to the abolition of slavery, they are con-
triving to continue its detestable power by
legislative acts against pretended vagrants.
They know that any form of servitude will
answer their unholy purpose. They pro-
nounce the four years' war a brilliant sword
scene in the great revolutionary dramas.
Proscriptive public sentiment holds high
carnival, and profiting by the example of
the Presidential pilgrim, breathes out
threatenings of slaughter against loyalty,
ignores and denounces all legal restraints,
and assails with the tongue of malignant
slander the constitutionally chosen repre-
sentatives of the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To still the voice of liberty, dangerous
alone to tyrants, midnight conflagrations,
assassinations and murders in open day are
called to their aid; a reign of terror through
all these ten states makes loyalty stand
silent in the presence of treason or whisper
in bated breath. Strong men hesitate
openly to speak for liberty and decline to
attend a convention at Philadelphia for
fear of destruction.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But all southern men are not yet awed
into submission to treason, and we have
assembled from all these states determined
that liberty, when endangered, shall find
a mouthpiece, and that the government of
the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth. We are
here to consult together how best to pro-
vide for a Union of truly republican states,
to seek to resume thirty six stars on the
old flag.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are here to see that ten of these stars,
opaque bodies paling their ineffectual fires
beneath the gloom of darkness of oligar-
chical tyranny and oppression—we wish
them to be brilliant stars, emblems of con-
stitutional liberty, glitering orbs sparkling
with the life giving principles of the model
republic, fitting ornaments of the glorious
banner of freedom.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our last and only hope is in the unity
and fortitude of the loyal people of Ame-
rica, in the support and vindication of the
Thirty-ninth Congress, and the election of
a controlling Union majority in the suc-
ceeding or Fortieth Congress. While the
new article amending the national Consti-
tution offers the most liberal conditions to
the authors of the rebellion and does not
come up to the measure of our expectations,
we believe its ratification would be the
commencement of a complete and lasting
protection to all our people ; and, there-
fore, we accept it as the best present re-
medy, and appeal to our brothers in the
North and the West to make it their watch-
word in the coming elections.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The tokens are auspicious of overwhelm-
ing success. However little the verdics of
the ballotbox many affect the reckless man
in the Presidential chair, we cannot doubt
that the traitors and sympathisers will
recognise that verdict as the surest indica-
tion that the mighty power which crushed
the rebellion is still alive, and that those
who attempt to oppose or defy it will do
so at the risk of their own destruction.{{< /news/text >}}

FROM THE EVENING POST.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Prussia's New Position.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
FRANCE, August, 1866.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}What singular and wonderful fortune
has been that of the Prussian monarchy.
Four hundred and twenty years ago, a
petty Count of Hohenzollern, who was
Burgrave at Nuremberg, obtained, from
Sigismond, Emperor of Germany, the
Province of Brandenburg, which had
neither military nor commercial import-
ance. It was one of the most unimpor-
tant Principalities, and the heads of the
Germanic empire could never have im-
agined nor even dreamed that the inher-
itors of this insignificant territory would
ever dare dispute the supremacy of the
Hapsburg dynasty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the time of the Reformation, the
princes of Brandenburg began to acquire
more power and importance. Property
belonging to the Romish clergy was con-
fiscated, and, in consequence of larger
revenues, the civil heads were able to in-
crease the number of their soldiers. Yet
Brandenburg was still in a very inferior
rank; much below Saxony, Westphalia
and many other German Principalities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the Thirty Years War the Electors
of Brandenburg joined the heroic Gusta-
vus Adolphus, but did not play an im-
portant part in the conflict. The Swedes
and Saxons were greatly superior, both
in the matter of revenue and military
strength.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is singular that the Revocation of
the Edict of Nantes was the origin of
new destiny to Prussia. Very many
French families, exiled by the brutal
despotism of Louis XIV., brought their
manufacturing arts to this country. The
Huguenots were good citizens, brave
soldiers, skillful workmen, and enriched
their new country at the expense of
France.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In 1701 the Elector of Brandenburg
obtained the title of king, soliciting this
act of munificence from the Emperor of
Germany, to whom, as vassal, he had
rendered important service. But this new
title did not confer greater authority or
respect on Frederic First. This newly-
created king continued to be the humble
dependant of the Emperor, and could
undertake no military expedition with-
out the permission of his Suzerain chief.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Prussia's true greatness began in the
middle of the eighteenth century, under
the reign of Frederic II. This great
captain, who was on intimate terms with
Voltaire and other philosophers of his
time, maintained, as much by his genius
as by the number of his soldiers, three
great struggles, not only against the
House of Austria, but against a great
continental coalition. He annexed Sile-
sia and a part of Poland to his hereditary
dominions. Nevertheless, at his death,
in 1786, Prussia had not over seven mil-
lions of inhabitants. But she had a well
disciplined army of 200,000 men, and
unshaken confidence in the bravery of
her battalions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is well known that the Prussians,
by turns conquerors and conquered, in
their long war against Napoleon, crown-
ed their exploits on the field of Water-
loo. The King of Prussia was rewarded
by the treaties of 1815; he obtained a
part of Saxony and other provinces,
which gave him considerable rank among
the continental potentates. But the Em-
pire of Austria preserved incontestable
supremacy in Germany, and its represen-
tative had the presidency at the Diet of
Frankfurt.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What a change following late events!
Austrian troops have been beaten in
every encounter, and the Prussians, af-
ter invading Bohemia, Moravia, a part of
Hungary, etc., have threatened to enter
the capital of the Emperor Francis Jo-
seph.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At this day the Prussian king, second-
ed by his Prime Minister, Count Bis-
marck, dictates conditions of peace. Be-
sides the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein,
he gains those of Nassau and Han[over],
etc. Still more, he is at the head of the
new Confederacy and commander-in-
chief of the armies, and to him are en-
trusted diplomatic arrangements, etc.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prussian monarchy will have al-
most absolute control over thirty millions
of Germans—an army of from 5 to 600,-
000 men, perfectly disciplined, financed
in a flourishing condition, an intelligent
and industrious population—in a word,
all the elements of great power and great
prosperity for the future. The Prussian
king will be the real emperor of North-
ern Germany, from the Baltic to the
Rhine.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to Southern Germany, formed of
secondary states, with six millions of in-
habitants, what resistance can she offer
to Prussia's colossal preponderance? She
would be like a little planet constrained
to roll in the orbit of a star of the first
magnitude.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is certain that the interior situation
of Germany is wisely changed, and that,
consequently, the balance of power in
Europe has undergone great modifica-
tions. Will Napoleon III. accept this
new state of things without demanding
increase of territory? He has not yet
spoken his final words on this subject.
As with Russia; she will probably endea-
vor to gain something in the East to
compensate her for the dangers to which
she is exposed in the North.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Everything is uncertain at the present
time, and each State is making prepara-
tions to march to the battle-field, if
events require.{{< /news/text >}}

Personal Influence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Blessed influence of one true, loving,
human soul on another! Not calculable
by algebra, not deducible by logic, but
mysterious, effectual, mighty as the hid-
den process by which the tiny seed is
quickened, and bursts forth into tall stem
and broad leaf, and glowing unsoil'd
flower. Ideas are often poor ghosts ; our
sun-filled eyes cannot discern them; they
pass athwart us in thin vapor, and can-
not make themselves felt. But some-
times they are made flesh; they breathe
upon us with warm breath, they touch
us with soft responsive hands, they look
at us with sad, sincere eyes, and speak to
us in appealing tones ; they are clothed
in a living human soul, with all its faith
and its love. Then their presence is a
power, then they shake us like a passion,
and we are drawn after them with mute
compulsion, as flame is drawn into flame.

The T'achcen Canal.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The canal which is being cut from
this city to the T'achcen river, a dis-
tance of about fourteen miles has, we
learn, been excavated only two thirds
of the way—-one third being at the
eastern terminus and the other at
the western. Why is it, we beg to
ask, has that work progressed so slow-
ly! Nearly a year ago, we were in-
formed by persons in whose judgment
we could confide, that it would be
finished in four or five months from
that time. Has the Siamo-Chinese
nobleman, to whom the government
gave the contract, become straitened
for the want of funds to complete it?
If we have been correctly informed,
he promised government that he would
make the canal and a carriage road
on one of its banks for the privilege
of establishing two Hue-lotteries on
the T'achcen river—-one at Nakawn
cheisee, and the other in the town of
T'achcen, with the exclusive right of
using them for a period of three years.
Another mode allowed him by gov-
ernment for remunerating himself for
the work instead of the hui lotteries,
was, as we learn, a license to take a
certain amount of tolls on all boats
that shall pass in the canal for the
period of ten years, and a tax of one
salung per rei on all paddy fields
within fifteen sens—equal to 300 Siamese
fathoms from the canal on either side
for the same time. By a circular
which the contractor issued July 1865,
it would appear that he then submit-
ted the two modes for the opinion of
all readers of the paper, requesting
each one, to send to him within twelve
days, "in few words," showing
which of the two plans he would pre-
fer to have taken in collecting money
to pay for the canal. We have never
heard any official report of that novel
election. We presume that the con-
tractor did not collect more than fifty
ballots altogether, and doubt whether
he got more than half that number.
But it has been currently reported,
that the election showed the minds of
the people to be in favor of the lot-
tery-plan; and the reason given is
that it will compel no one to pay
any tax for the privileges of the canal,
since all who may venture to try their
fortunes at the lotteries will do so
simply because they love to gamble.
It is said, too, that the contractor was
well pleased with this view of the
matter, as it will be a much shorter
process of the two, will be attended
with much less trouble to himself, and
will be equally if not more remunera-
tive than the other.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From such reports we have been
led to think that two lotteries were
soon to be established on the Ta'cheen
River-—that the canal contractor
would do all in his power of course to
induce all the people in that thrifty
province to try their fortunes at the
game—-thus increasing the curse of
gambling in that section fifty fold—-
intoxicating all the people with it, and
keeping them crazed from day to day
and month to month, to the ruin of
their business, their estates, and their
families. It seemed to us like a license
of the government to the contractor
to humbug the people by mere visions
of coming affluence, and then in their
dreams to take their money from them.
Or like giving him liberty to conjure
legions of evil spirits to his aid in de-
ceiving them, so that he could take
their money without compensation,
and that, too, by the dignity and ma-
jesty of law.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such a sad picture of that matter
have we had before us for months
even until after commencing the writ-
ing of this article. But now we are
exceedingly glad to learn from a no-
bleman in whom we can place confi-
dence, that the Siamese government
has decided, that no lotteries shall be
established on Ta’cheen River. and
no where else for collecting funds for
paying the expenses of that canal, and
that the plan of taking tolls and tax-
ing the paddy fields on its border
shall be adopted. If this is true,
which we fondly hope it is, then we have
another pleasing evidence that Young
Siam is still on the march of improve-
ment. We fervently hope and pray
that she will not slacken her progress,
but rather increase it until gambling
of all kinds (to speak now of no other
evil) shall be placed where it should
be in the same category with thieving.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}and robbing, and forbidden by penal-
ties which will stay the curse from des-
olating the whole land as it now does.
The gambling farms now in operation
every where are clothed with honor
and power by the government; and
the grand excuse of the government
for legalizing them is, that the people
are so much in love of gambling that
no laws can keep them from it, and
that it is far better that the govern-
ment should systematize it,—confim-
ing it within certain localities, and get
a revenue from it, than that it should
start up in every house without re-
straint and pay only the winners.
Preposterous reasoning! The govern-
ment not strong enough to check this
evil! Then it is the weakest that has
ever been known. As well might it
be said that government is not strong
enough to check theiving and robbing!
But it is said, let the government get
a little stronger before it undertake it,
and then it will make a thorough
work of it. How long pray, will it
require for government to become
strong enough for checking gambling
while it is by this means continually
sowing discord and poverty and crime
in the land!{{< /news/text >}}

Sandwich Islands No. 6.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The good Regent KAAHUMANA,
seeing the efforts which the Roman
Catholies were making to subvert the
good work which had been begun by
the Protestant missionaries, and the
outrages that were being committed
at Lahaina and Honolulu by foreign
seamen, aided even by an officer of
the U. S. Navy, to break down the
new laws of chastity which had been
made, wrote a letter to the A. B. C.
F. M. requesting them to send over
more teachers. She addressed the
Board as "friends and kindred," saying
"I wish you to send hither more teach-
ers to increase the light of Jesus
Christ, for great has been the kind-
ness of God towards the people of
dark hearts." Her short prayer met
with a quick response, and she had
the great gratification of welcoming
the second reinforcement of the mis-
sion March 31st 1828. It consisted
of 4 ordained missionaries, 1 physici-
an, 1 printer, with their wives, and 4

missionaries sent to the Islands since
1819 is forty. Besides these, several
sons of those missionaries, educated
in the U. S. have returned to the
Islands as missionaries. There have
also been six physicians, twenty lay-
men as teachers, printers etc, and
eighty three females, all but three of
them wives of missionaries, and as-
sistant missionaries. The term of
missionary labor on the Islands,
with the clerical members of the
Mission, averages about twenty one
years. One of them has been there
forty four years; four, thirty six years;
one, thirty three years, four, thirty-
two, and two, thirty-one, years.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We copy the following statistical
history of the Hawaiin Churches from
Dr. Anderson's book.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first native convert admitted to
the church was Koopaolani in 1823
* * * Up to the year 1832, and
including that year, the whole num-
ber of members received was 577.
The admissions in the next ten years
were 29,651. Of these 19,877 were
received in the years 1838-–1840; 2243
in 1842; and 5,396 in 1843,—indica-
ting the years of the great awakening.
The average number of each of the ten
years is nearly 3,000. The admissions
in the next ten years were 12,325, or
an annual average of 1,232. In the
next ten, the number received was
8,802, giving an annual average of 880
new members. The whole number
from the beginning is 50,913, or an
average for each year (of the 40 years
since the first admission) of more than
a thousand. To this an addition of
1,500 for the Protestant evangelical
churches of Makawao, in East Maui,
connected with the American Mission-
ary Association, which would swell the
sum total to 52,413. The excommu-
nications in this period of forty years,
not including the churches of Makawao,
were not far from 8000." * * * * *{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“The accessions to the Roman
Catholic community, especially in for-
mer years, are understood to have been
largely from the excommunicated
Protestant church-members.”
The gospel as preached by the Pro-
testaut missionaries by the power of
the Almighty Spirit at first took a
strong hold of many of the principal
chiefs, by whom the government was
early converted to a decidedly chris-
tian character. Many of these chiefs
were burning and shining lights to their
people. Among them, Kaahumani and
Kapiolani were the most remarkable.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Kalanimoka, whom the natives call-
ed "the Iron Cable of their country"
was among the early converts. He had
been a great warrior, and became still
more illustrious as a christian. "Lu
him the heathen warrior was seen
transformed into the peaceful, joyous
christian." "The world" he said, as
he drew near death "is full of sorrow,
but in heaven there is no sorrow nor
pain—it is good, it is bright, it is hap-
py." He died of dropsy Feb. 8th 1827.
His death was deeply felt by the re-
gent Kaahumanu, as she had made
hun her right hand counselor a long
time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Adams Kuakini, governor of Ha-
waii was admitted to church fellow-
ship in 1827, and prince Kekuanaoa

{{< news/text >}}The illustrious Kaahumanu died June
5th, 1832 being fifty eight years of
age. "She possessed great native
strength of character, which was en-
riched and adorned by grace. From
being selfish, proud, haughty, and op-
pressive, she became the humble and

{{< news/text >}}His Majesty the king commenced
his annual visitations of the royal
temples in this city on Friday the
16th inst and has been every day al-
most exclusively occupied with it.
He has visited usually three temples
a day and sometimes four.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Friday the first day, it is said
that he was arrayed in his richest
state costume, attended by all the
insignia of royalty, and being borne
in his golden sedan followed by a
large and imposing retinue, he pro-
ceeded to Wat P'rachetoo p'on, Wat
Rajah Boonnah and Wat Soot'at.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Saturday His Majesty was car-
ried in a less imposing style, yet with
an august train on a royal sedan to
Wat Chakrawat, Wat Samp'ant'a-
woug, and Wat P'atoom Koughk'a.
In going to the last named temple
His Majesty passed through the great
Bazar, which had been stripped of all
the temporary sheds and market
stalls in front of the brick buildings
which greatly cramp the street, and
the whole extent of it was swept
and garnished and enlarged so that
one had to reflect a good deal before
he could bring his mind to believe
that it was the old Bazar street.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Sunday His Majesty appeared
in one of his best royal estates on
the river, visiting Wat Rak'ang,
Wat Aroonarataraim, and Wat Hong
Saram.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Monday he worshipped and dis-
tributed priest's robes in Wat Somlit-
tiatweehan, Wat Bawraniwat and Wat
Maha Trit'aram being conveyed to
them in a royal barge.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On Tuesday His Majesty again pass-

Wat Nâng, Wat Naug-nawng, Wat

learn, that he is going to make an un-
usually short work of these visitations
in the city this year, determining to
close it up in two days more, which
will make nine days since he commenc-
ed it. But he will deputize, we un-
derstand, some one or more of the
princehood to distribute priests robes
in his name in other royal temples in
and about the city. We hear that H.
E. Chow Phaya Kalahome is soon to
leave on this business to the royal
temples in the old city.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}These royal processions on the riv-
er, numbering from one hundred to
one hundred and fifty of the finest
state barges passing up and down the
Menam, are very imposing. The roy-
al seat rua pratinany is not far from
200 feet long and six feet wide in the
middle, having a very tasty and
rich canopy, elegantly draped. It is
propelled by 70 or 80 paddlers.
The barge carrying the priests robes
immediately following, is about the
same size and nearly as grand. This
is called rua pratinany rawng—-the
auxillary royal seat boat. The royal
guard barges, numbering from 40 to
60 are of the same general form, and
but a little smaller than the royal seat.
The barges of the many princes and
principal chiefs who follow the king
in these processions are all essentially
of the same form as that of the king's
barge, and are fully manned, each with
from 40 to 50 paddlers—-all of each
boat being in some kind of uniform
with one another, but not so necessa-
rily with that of any other boat in the
procession. Many of the crews wore
white jackets—-some red—-some of ca-
lico print—and some wore no garment
above the waist.—-Some had fillets on
their foreheads, some turbans of yellow
red or white, and some had nothing
at all on their heads. The men in
many of the guard boats wore shirts
apparently made in some preceding
generation, and great leathern hats
equally old. The object of their dis-
play, was, we suppose, to keep up a
lively remembrance of Old Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We noticed our Harbor Master and
Master Attendant, attending His Ma-
jesty in these processions, riding in a
regular Siamese state barge, arrayed
like an English Admiral in his high-
est official costume.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The royal brass band, playing Euro-
pean airs while the processions are
passing on the river and canals, and
when His Majesty lands at a temple
or departs from it, is to us the only
really pleasant and animating thing we
see or hear in all this august display.
But we failed to notice any improve-
ment in the performances of the band
from year to year as they appear in
these processions. The fault may be
partly owing to our own peculiar taste
for music. Having a skillful European
Master, the band should show some-
thing extra on these extraordinary
occasions{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now to what purpose is all this ado
—this great expense of time and mon-
ey every year? It is to sustain and
honor the king in his extraordinary
efforts to prop up Buddhistical idola-
try as long as the power and authority
of Siamese kings can make it stand.
But the most enlightened of the thou-
sands who follow the king in these
processions, and thus appear to adhere
still firmly to Buddhism, have, we
think, made up their minds that the
system is a great humbug, and des-
tined to flee from before the light of
the gospel ere long, as the night flees
from before the sun. Others think
this a period in the existence of Budd-
hism when it must necessarily, accor-
ding to the eternal course of nature,
decline until it shall become appa-
rently extinct in all the universe. But
then there is to be a period, billions of
ages in the eternity to come, when it
will be resurrected; and hence they
seem to infer that there is peculiar
merit in honoring and sustaining it to
its last breath, and then to aid in giv-
ing it the most honorable burial.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Since our leading article was put in
type, we have been credibly informed,
that the canal to T'achorn is now pro-
gressing rapidly, that there only re-
mains 40 sens, equal to about one
mile to be excavated, and that it will
be done within another month.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But we are made sorrowful by learn-
ing that the land on either side of the
canal through its whole extent, which
belonged to government, has been taken
up by nobles and lords, so that the poor-
er classes are quite excluded from ever
becoming owners of any of it We had
fondly hoped that the common working
classes would have been allowed to
squat on much of that tract of laud,
and to hold it as their own in consi-
deration of the annual payment of the
usual taxes on paddy fields But no.
A capital chance for speculation is be-
ing opened by the canal, and monied
men have been allowed to close the
door against any poor man having any
share in it, excepting such as are slaves
to them, or beco e their hired ser-
vants.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And we furthermore learn, that
those nobles and lords have it in their
power to dispose as they please of the
hopes of having a carriage road on one
of the banks of the canal, that the
king is not going to insist upon carry-
ing out that original plan, and that
consequently it will in all probability
fall through.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Those powerful lords find that it
will be very profitable to have fre-
quent openings or ditches from the
canal into their paddy fields, which it
would be troublesome and expensive
to keep well bridged over for a car-
riage road, and such a road would
make it necessary for them to build
fences between it and their rice fields.
For such reasons, they seem not to
wish for any public road, the canal be-
ing all the thoroughfare they need for
their business.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And we learn that, even now, they
have made a multitude of these
ditches, which have been a great em-
barrassment to the work of making
the canal, as the powerful rains have
sent the water in floods into the ca-
nal, carrying away the banks, and fil-
ling up the channel with mud. It is
reported also that no one is empow-
ered with sufficient authority to for-
bid this conduct of the lords, and that
the consequence is, that there is likely
to be scarcely a comfortable foot path
on either bank.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hope and trust that it is not
true, as reported, that the king is get-
ting slack in his old age, and that

{{< news/text >}}As we failed to obtain a regular re-
port of the arrival of the last Chow
Phya, we consequently failed to learn
who came as passengers by her, and
wholly forgot to enquire until the pa-
per was struck off. We would now
report that G. W. Virgin Esqr. return-
ed from Singapore on the 6th inst.,
and we are glad to learn that he ap-
pears to be much improved in health.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The Siam steamer Chow Phya left
the bar on the 12th inst. at 9 A. M. for
Singapore. Messrs Harvey, Black
and Paine went passengers in her.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The shipping in port is gradually
increasing and we may expect soon to
see quite a fleet in the river. There
is now 53 vessels in the harbor, con-
sisting of 8 British, 3 American, 4
Hamburg, 3 Prussian, 3 Dutch, and 30
Siamese vessels. Tonnage, British
2332, American 1973, Hamburg 1520,

{{< news/text >}}We are informed that the king has
sent a great variety of things which

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The present King of Siam,
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
PRA CHAWN KLAU
CHAPTER XII.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The government as it has been ad-
ministered in Siam has afforded little
inducement to enterprise or little stimu-
lus to progress, and it has afforded the
greatest obstacles to the introduction
of purer morals and a holier religion.
The whole system has been at antipod-
es with the first law of good govern-
ment, love thy neighbor and fear to do
him wrong. And though we are sure
that reform has been instituted, its
development will be slow, almost im-
perceptible.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The most disheartening feature in
the government is, that instead of af-
fording protection and stimulus to
progress, the legitimate object of law,
the people every where meet op-
pression, fraud, and intrigue from those
who ought to protect and deal justly
and uprightly, become reckless in
meeting the demands of law, and resort
to every variety of evasion. Taxes,
sometimes remain unpaid for years.
When the culprit is eventually caught
and compelled to settle the demands
against him, he has nothing to pay,
and hence debts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A debt for taxes unpaid is always
considered an unjust demand, to be
evaded if possible. Indeed a Siamese
always seems to feel that all money
which goes to pay a debt is sheer loss,
and all obtained on credit pure gain.
And the shuffling to escape an honest
due, makes the debt and credit sys-
tem very precarious, and interest, as
a natural consequence astounding,
doubling the principal in two years and
eight months by law.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When the original debt is once
doubled interest ceases. The creditor
then demands his money, and if the
debtor cannot pay he must be a ser-
vant for security, and work without
remuneration till such time as he shall
meet the full demand. He now has a
large debt with no means to liquidate
it, unless he has a wife and children
to sell and meet the demand, making
themselves for debt, till the demands
are all cancelled from other sources.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}gives his family as slaves for the bor-
rowed money, the interest will go on
accumulating again, unless his family
work and let their services keep down
the interest.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}According to the usages of the coun-
try the services of debtors, or their
family, only meet the interest even in
small demands. There is no arrange-
ment gradually to pay the debt. It is
a very disheartening usage, and no
wonder the poor people loose all their
enterprise, and live from hand to
mouth, blessing the moment that they
can secure a penny to treat themselves
to a present luxury.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The pay and perquisites obtained
in all classes and conditions and all
kinds of service is small. Officials get
small salaries and make it up in bribes.
The farmers of revenue find various
ways to fill their own pockets, the
destruction of the people follow-
ing as a consequence notwithstand-
ing. Servants are suffered to appro-
priate a certain percentage, and allow-
ance made for it in rewarding service.
A head workman is paid by those
under him for securing a place for
them, or for securing their merchan-
dize, and the victims of the overseer
make up the deficit by cheating the
master.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A good man might give a servant
greater pay to induce him to give up
his perquisites, but the servant would
be sure that greater pay implied greater
service, and feel himself entitled to
greater perquisites in proportion.
Should the employer rail against the
usages of the country, and teach that
he would insist on a more equitable
arrangement, and give as a reason his
disinterested benevolence; the servant
would be very slow to believe. For the
greatest acts of benevolence, in Siam,
are more to accumulate merit to the
giver than to do good to the receiver.
Disinterested benevolence is quite out
of the question, and gratitude need
not have a place in the language, for
there is no use for it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But there is nothing that so excites
my indignation as the regular legaliz-
ed methods of demoralizing children.
As I have been writing this article a
case has occured in point. A little boy
came to us from down the coast of the
Gulf. He was out to play and went
to the new road to view the wonders.
He had been gone a few minutes when
he came running to us wanting to bor-
row four pennies. Why! what do you
want to do? we cautiously asked. Oh I
saw them gambling in the street "right
out here" and staked and lost four
pennies and the man has taken my
waistcloth and I want to redeem it.
Redeem it! we indignantly exclaimed,
and went to demand the cloth. But,
argued the man, we pay the king for
the privilege. Yes for the privilege
of ruining our little boys! Shall we
love the Siamese children better than
their own king? God forbid that it
should long be thus.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Siam is a little country it is true.
So was England, and England was
once in the sisterhood of nations as in-
considerate as Siam is now. This was
when the nation sacrificed to false gods.
A purer religion and laws based on the
teachings of this religion have raised
them from their degralation and given
them a great name among the nations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There should be efficient, thorough
administration of government—the
good of the people sought in all clas-
ses and conditions, and the people
taught to appreciate law, and be ready
to pay liberaly to have it thoroughly
executed. Punishment for crime
ought to be so administered as to save
the culprit, and yet be a preventive to
the commission of crime. Offenders
should be vigilantly hunted out, and
judiciously and efficiently treated that
there may be no inducement to sin.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How is punishment administered in
Siam? A thief is very sure to escape
justice if he shelters himself under the
shadow of some powerful man, and
divides with him literaly his goods.
It is quite impossible to detect a thief.
Yet in western countries the most
covert sins meet perfectly certain de-
velopements. They bring to bear every
variety of detectives. It is seemingly
impossible to escape the police.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A vigilantly executed government
removes all inducements to crime, as
the most improved fire-arms remove
inducements to war and blood shed.
It is hope of escape, it is chances of
success which give stimulus to wicked
thoughts and wicked passions, and de-
luge the world with actions that must
make infinite holiness repent that he
made men, and lead to terrible retri-
butive justice. Hence those that fear
God, fear to do evil.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr Editor.-—I would like to make
the inquiry through your paper when
we are to have a Post Office in Bang-
kok! Is there another city here in the
East where there is as much business
done as in Bangkok that has not a
Post Office? Certainly there is not.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The way that mail matter is now
distributed in this city may be the best
under the circumstances, although not
satisfactory to all, yet it is certainly a
great tax upon the time and patience
of those in the Consulate where it is
done. The establishment of a P. O.
would relieve them as well as insure
greater safety and certainty in the de-
livery of all mail matter for this place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is reported that a mail steamer,
which is soon to commence running
from Singapore to Saigon, will occa-
sionally touch at Bangkok. Now why
cannot arrangements be made to have
this place included in that route, and
a Post Office established here for the
better and more satisfactory delivery
of the mails? This is certainly a matter
that demands immediate attention.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some months ago the Siamese gov-
ernment, much to their praise, pro-
posed to take the initiatory steps to
establish a postal line between Singa-
pore and Bangkok, the capital of their
country, with a Post Office at the lat-
ter place, and applied to Her Britannic
Majesty’s Consul here for counsel and
encouragement. But strange to say,
and much to the disappointment of
many here, he discouraged the pro-
posal, and the consequence was, the
project was abandoned. He, above all
others, it was thought, would have
given it his hearty consent and co-oper-
ation. If this is an index of his pub-
lic spirit of progress and improve-
ment, is he a fit representative of the
English nation ever marching onward
to improvement?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would naturally be supposed that
those coming here from western na-
tions, and especially the representatives
of treaty powers, who ought to have
most influence with the Siamese Gov-
ernment would be wide awake to the
introduction into this country of all
improvements calculated to benefit
themselves as well as the nation where
they reside. The Siamese are sadly in
want of a good postal system through-
out their own country. They have
now no other means of sending com-
munications to any of their provinces
than dispatching a special messenger
for that purpose. They seem to have
no idea of the benefits of a good postal
system.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have no doubt but that the Siam-
ese Government will still favor the
project, and try to do all they can
towards the introduction of so great an
improvement into their country, but
they must have the co-operation and
encouragement of the treaty powers
here.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I simply make these inquiries, and
throw out these hints in order to
direct the attention of those most in-
terested to this important matter, and
hope that the spirit will again be revi-
ved, and something permanently and
satisfactorily accomplished.{{< /news/text >}}

Chinese Litofature.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The date of the invention of paper seems
to prove that some of the most important
arts connected with the process of civiliz-
ation are not extremely ancient in China.
In the time of Confucius they wrote on
the finely pared bark of the bamboo with
a stile; they next used silk and linen, why
the character CHY paper is compounded
of that for silk. it was not until A. D. 95
that paper was invented. The materials
which they use in the manufacture are va-
rious. A coarse yellowish paper used for
wrapping parcels, is made from rice straw.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The better kinds are composed of the
LINER, or inner bark of a species of MORUS,
as well as of cotton, but principally of
bamboo. As a reading people, the litera-
ture of China is, as may be expected, very
abundant in quantity, if not superexcellent
in quality. The main portion consists of
plays, romances, and novels. The general
character of these indicates a powerful
imagination and a love of the grotesque;
but the literary tone is low, and there is
little, if any, moral purpose evinced in the
development of the plots. The historical
literature is highly significant of the na-
tional character. There is a continuous
history of China from the earliest ages
down to the conclusion of the Mongol
Tartar dynasty, called “The Twenty-one
Historians,” consisting of nearly three
hundred of those BROCHURES, or thin vo-
lumes, stitched with silk, about ten of
which are generally contained in a folding
case. Yet we should search in vain in
these volumes for anything beyond a bar-
ren chronicle of facts and dates. Trains
of reasoning and lessons of political phi-
losophy can scarcely be looked for in a
country, the theory of whose government
has always been despotic, however tem-
pered by other circumstances. – “Instead
of allowing,” observes Mr. Gutalaff, every
correctly, "that common mortals had any
part in the affair of the world, they speak
only of the emperors who then reigned.
They represent them as the source from
which the whole order of things emanated,
and all others as mere puppets, who moved
at the pleasure of the autocrat. This is
truly Chinese ; the whole nation is repre-
sented by the Emperor, and absorbed by
him.—EXCHANGE{{< /news/text >}}

Alcohol in the Brain.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Not uncommonly we see very promising
youths, who have shown great brilliancy
of mind, and strength and energy of char-
acter, commence drinking (moderately, to
be sure) at as early an age as twelve; per-
haps they take beer more frequently than
anything else, but as they approach man-
hood, the character of the mind is changed
—they become dull, almost stupid, and
have lost all the energy they once showed.
Their own hopes, as well as those of their
friends, are thus disappointed, for the for-
mer integrity of the mind is never regain-
ed. I suppose it will be understood, from
the remarks made in the early part of
what I have said, that alcohol in any form,
when taken into the system, goes forward
not to assist in nourishment, but to deteri-
orate the tissues of the brain, and unfit
them for performing their offices in a
healthy manner. At the age of from ten
to fourteen the brain is fast acquiring the
bulk it is ever after to maintain, and with
the growth in size there is a corresponding
growth in activity and power. If, in this
transitional period, we subject it to the
influences of so unnecessary an agent as
alcohol, we should expect it to be in some
way diverted from its natural growth. We
may not check its growth in size, but we
may diminish its quality, and it may re-
semble some fruits in whom the parent
plant has been supplied with improper
nourishment—the fruit is large and devel-
oped, but of a quality too poor for use.—

The decoy which makes
Young Men Drunkards.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Go with us to the public house, where a
number of young men are assembled. All
is life and gayety. A few among them
may be young and timid. They approach
the counter, and wine, rum, and brandy,
are called for. One or two may stand back
and say, - No, gentlemen, we do not drink
any." Immediately the rest turn and be-
gin to taunt their friends who refuse to
drink, saying they are afraid of getting
''tight,'' of the ''ol' man;'' and some may
whisper audibly, ''Well, they are mean
fellows - they are afraid that they will
have to spend a cent!'' Here, you see, two
very sensitive nerves are touched—Cour-
age and Claverness. Their bosoms swell
with pride, and rather than bear these
stings of their companions, they step up to
the counter, and soon join in the revelry.
The ice is now broken and the first great
act in the drama performed. Others fol-
low in natural order, until the individual
who refused to drink at first, reels along
the public street without shame.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Such is the manner in which thousands
of our promising young men are led away
by a false ambition; and thousands more
will follow in their path, unless they learn
the meaning of courage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have in our mind a number of no-
ble-hearted, good meaning men, who do
not possess strength of mind enough to
face this opposition. Rather than be call-
ed mean, they will follow up these habits
of drinking until their appetites become
uncontrollable.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}PRESIDENT JOHNSON has made another
damaging speech (to himself) in which he
reviews the course of those opposed to his
policy. He has also made a brief response
to a colored crowd that was celebrating
the Emancipation Act. One thanked him
for his promise, when the President re-
plied: ''Yes, my man, you will find out in
the long run, who is your friend, and I
have always tried to be such.'' To this the
negro replied: ''Excuse me, Mr. Presi-
dent, but I hope you will do a little better
by us hereafter than you have been do-
ing.'''' Mr. A. H. Stephens has testified
before the Reconstruction Committee of
Congress ........ He held that the Southern
States lost none of their rights by rebel-
lion. ''True,'' says the EVENING POST,
but the REBELS in them lost all their
rights, EXCEPT THE RIGHT TO BE HANG-
ED.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE COMMISSIONER of Customs, a day

{{< news/text >}}INVESTIGATIONS into the nature of the

that it is created by insects imperceptible

Prospectus.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The object of the Company and the
facilities for its operations are thus brief-
ly stated in the prospectus. "It is pro-
posed to construct a line of Telegraph
by land from Maulmain or some other
point in the Tenasserim Provinces where
the British Indian line terminates, pass-
ing down the Malay Peninsula to Singa-
pore, touching at Penang and Malacca.
A branch line to be carried from Tavoy
to Bangkok, the capital of Siam, and
thence (with permission of the French
Government) to Saigon in Cochin China.
The length of these lines, it is estimated,
will be about 2,000 miles. The main line
will also be joined with that of the Ne-
therlands India Government by means
of a cable from Malacca to Bankalis in
Sumatra. The Governor General of In-
dia in Council is prepared to give every
reasonable assistance and facility to the
construction of that portion of the line
which will pass through British territory,
and the Governor General of Nether-
lands India has expressed himself in ve-
ry favorable terms in regard to the pro-
posed junction with the Netherlands In-
dia telegraph system. Concessions, for
ninety-nine years each, of the exclusive
right to carry the lines through their
respective territories, have been granted
by His Majesty the King of Siam, the
Sri Maha Rajah of Johore and the Sul-
tan of Sulleugore, and have received the
sanction of the Government of India and
the approval of the Foreign Office. The
protection of the several native Govern-
ments has been formally promised in the
construction and working of the lines.
From enquiries which have been institu-
ted, it is believed that the proposed lines
from the Tenasserim Provinces to Singa-
pore and Bangkok could be erected with-
in one year from their being commenced,
and from the progress which is being
made with the line of the Netherlands
India Government through Sumatra, it
is expected that it will be completed be-
fore the end of 1867, so that there would
be no delay in bringing the two lines
into conjunction and immediate working.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With regard to the probable usefulness
of the line the prospectus continues as
follows. "The proposed lines would
form important links in the establish-
ment of telegraphic communication be-
tween Europe, via India, and the Aus-
tralian Colonies on the one hand and
China on the other. Negotiations have,
indeed, been opened with the several
Governments of the former, which have
promised every assistance and encourage-
ment to the extension of the line in that
direction. It is believed that the sanc-
tion of the King of Cochin China could
be obtained to the construction of a line
from the Siamese frontier to his capital,
Hue, on the Gulf of Tonquin, whence by
submarine cable an extension to Hong-
kong could be completed with stations at
the island of Hainan if thought necess-
ary. The advantages of a land over a
submarine line of Telegraph are obvious.
The much smaller cost of placing such a
line, (less by two-thirds) the greater
facilities for effecting repairs and their
trifling expense as compared with the
employment of steamers &c in the case
of submarine lines, need scarcely be
pointed out, and in fact the cost of erec-
ting the 2,000 miles of lines proposed,
with all other necessary outlay, is estima-
ted not to exceed Fifty pounds per mile
By small gratuities to the local chiefs of
the districts through which the lines will
pass their perfect security may be effect-
ually assured, whilst the experience of
the persons engaged in laying the Dutch
lines through Java and Sumatra, coun-
tries in all respects similar to the Malay
Peninsula, has shown that there are no
great physical difficulties to be overcome
and no danger to be dreaded from the
hostility of the natives or from the de-
structive habits of wild beasts."—The im-
portance of the scheme is too modestly
put forward here. It is not that a most
important link in an ultimate chain of
communication to China will have been
established; for it is more than probable
that both the Russian American wires
will have been at work before that by
way of British India will have reached
even Singapore, or Bangkok. But it is
the connection—-the only practicable
one—-which this peninsular route will ef-
fect between Great Britain and her vast
Australasian possessions; besides the im-
portant consideration that, whatever
other lines of telegraphic communication
may extend to China—that proposed by
the present Company is the only one
that will be independent of American,
Russian, and Continental influence. Al-
together, the scheme is one which, com-
mercially, offers a most promising invest-
ment for capital, and the great and polit-
ical importance of which it is impossi-
ble to over-estimate.—-STRAITS TIMES.{{< /news/text >}}

Momentous News From
Affghanistan.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(ENGLISHMAN.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}News which we have just received from
Affghanistan may throw some light upon
the nature of the Russian negotiations
which, as we lately stated, are said to be
going on at Cabool. A strong re-action is
taking place in favor of the deposed
Ameer Sher Ali Khan; and a brother of his
who was at Tukhtabol, in Turkistan, has
induced the troops to throw off their alle-
giance to Afzool Khan, and declare in
Sher Ali's favour. In consequence of this
state of feeling, the old troops are regarded
by Afsool Khan with extreme suspicion,
and he has been compelled to disband
many of them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A private letter, which we have every
reason to consider trustworthy, states that
the Ameer is in constant communication
with the Russian Envoys who have arrived
in Cabool, and that they have arrived at a
perfect understanding together. The
English Agent is said to have been dis-
missed, and to have arrived in Peshawar.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Russians have taken Samarkand,
Shahr Sube, Mery, and Koorchee, and are
at present encamped at the last named
place which they are fortifying and are
preparing to advance. The distance of
Koorchee from Bokhara is about forty-
four miles. From another source it is re-
ported that the Russian Government has
collected an army of 200,000 men at Ak
Masjid and Vernoe in addition to that
engaged against Khokan and Bokhara
with the object of conquering the whole of
the Provinces of Central Asia and that the
Czar would have carried out his schemes
of conquest before, but for the Khan
Badisha of Khotan having applied to the
British Government for aid. They have
also in another direction taken two of the
cities of Ili from whence they intend sen-
ding forces against the Kalmuck Tartars.{{< /news/text >}}

The Prussian Future.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
EXAMINER.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It has repeatedly been observed of late
years, that the great initiative in European
affairs belongs henceforth to Germany.
France had its day three quarters of a
century ago. England has had hers.
Both exercised great influence, and sowed
their political ideas and institutions to
spring up and flourish here, to be over-
grown and to perish there, neither fully
prevailing. It was thought that when
Napoleon the Third seized the reins of
government he would regain for France
the great initiative lost in 1810. The
French Emperor has been powerful and
active, prosperous and victorious. And
yet results have not turned out anywhere
as he intended. He launched the vessel,
but wind and tide were too strong to allow
him to hold the helm. And so European
changes, although owing their first impulse
to him, have still drifted into a state un-
foreseen by any. Has Prussia, or have its
statesmen, really obtained a firm grasp of
the helm? We doubt it much.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It will be said that Germany lost the
initiative in 1848; that it achieved its
revolution and made its popular voice as
well as its caused intellects predominant,
without being able to arrive at any result,
or lay even the foundations of a politi[?]al
edifice. But in 1866 Germany moved not
by its own impulse. It merely parodied
France's EMPIRE. Its present movement
has, no doubt, issued more from the brain
of one man than from the nation. Yet
still that is a German brain, developing
German ideas, and appealing to German
sentiments. So much so, that we do not
believe it possible or likely that even
Bismarck could succeed in introducing in-
to Germany a mere second edition of Im-
perial France.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whatever he does must at least be new.
A frank and undisguised despotism of
Prussia, with the concentration of all
power at Berlin, would be hazardous in
the extreme. It would be incompatible
with the presence or existence of a Ger-
man Parliament, in which Prussians pro-
per would be in a minority; and to make
such an attempt whilst dispensing with a
German Parliament would lead to dangers
of another kind. We must suppose, then,
that a Federal system of some sort will be
tried, and that Germans will be tried, and
that Germans will attempt something more
original and more up to the level of the
age than such a resuscitation of medieval
barbarism and rapacity as that shown by
General Manteuffel at Frankfort.{{< /news/text >}}

China from India through Burmah is a
matter that seems to be attracting a great
deal of attention at home. We lately

several influential members of parliament

ity of directing a survey of the country
through Burmah to Western China, in or-
der to ascertain the most practicable route
for a railway. Since then, the Liverpool,
and other Chambers of Commerce, have
united with that of Manchester in prose-
cution of that object, and a formal memor-
ial upon it is to be presented to the Sec-
retary of state. We sincerely trust that
this movement will be regarded favourably
by the Derby Ministry, for there can be no

tial to the success of the enterprise, will
greatly facilitate it.—EVENING MAIL{{< /news/text >}}
