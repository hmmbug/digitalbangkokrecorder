{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Bangkok 16th. Dec. 1865.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is seldom that we venture to say any
thing in reference to ourselves, but it is
sometimes necessary to refer to our own
affairs. Our readers will perceive by the
number of this issue, that another issue will
complete the volume, and consequently
close up the year. We commenced the
year under rather unfavourable circumstances,
consequently our expectations did not run
very high. The European community here,
upon whom we must depend almost whol-
ly for the support of a paper in the English
language, is small, and not only that, but
the last year has been one full of discourage-
ment to most of them. Many of them felt
poor, speaking comparatively with other
years, and consequently could not give a
paper that pecuniary encouragement which
otherwise might have been expected. The
newspaper growth here too, was rather
spontaneous, and it might have been feared,
that it would also be ephemeral. Our friend
of the "Straits Times" however wholly mis-
understands our editorial in the issue of
Oct. 14th, and takes it to mean that our
labors have not met with a proper pecuni-
ary reward. It was written, it is true in
rather a disposing strain, and unac-
quainted with the circumstances might
readily misunderstand it.  It did not how-
ever refer to our pecuniary affairs at all.
Our only expectation when we commenced
was to be able to pay the expenses of pub-
lishing, leaving little or nothing for labor.
In this we have not been disappointed.
Our receipts, if any thing, have rather sur-
passed our expectations.  The European
community have done nobly.  They have
gone beyond what could reasonably have
been expected in such a year as the last.
They have made a pretty good effort to-
wards supporting two papers.  We do not
believe that two papers can be supported
here, nor even one when taken as a separ-
rate business, but in connection with some-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}thing else in the same lines, it may be
made to pay expenses, still the community
deserves credit for what it has done.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is however another feature in our
paper which must not be overlooked. Our
object we had in view was to give the
Siamese a paper in their own language.
This was to a great extent an experiment,
and had to be undertaken with caution.
At first it was deemed expedient to have
pages of Siamese in connection with the
English. We soon however found much
encouragement, as justified in separating
it and making two distinct sheets. The
Siamese issue was again enlarged so as to
be equal in size with the English. In this
department, although the encouragement
is far from what we would like to see, still
it surpasses what could reasonably have
been expected. Whilst we give the Euro-
pean community credit for what they have
done, we must also in justice praise, the
Siamese for the manner in which they have
taken hold of this new enterprise amongst
them. It was a new thing to most of them.
It has also brought out from amongst them
several very respectable writers. We have
articles from some of them, although of no
great depth, still evincing a shrewdness
hardly to be expected. As to the matter,
and manner of our paper, we have tried as
far as possible to fulfill our promise at the
commencement, but we have laboured un-
der some difficulties. We have had noth-
ing but native composition, which rendered
it almost impossible to keep free from mis-
takes and typographical errors. Being a
semi-monthly also, any items which might
have been distracted from exchanges and
which would have been interesting to the
community, here, were gathered up by the
weekly paper long before we were ready
to come out, so that we have been obliged
to look entirely to another course for our
matter.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now, it may be asked, what is to become
of the "Recorder" in future? Is it to be
one of those things of spontaneous
growth, and ephemeral existence! Is it to
be a child of but one year's growth and then
depart, leaving but few to mourn its death?
Upon these questions it does not behove
one to speak too confidently. Newspaper
life, and especially in this hemisphere is
precarious. But we think we are safe in
announcing that the "Recorder" will be con-
tinued; and the Siamese issue must be con-
tinued, and we think the English will be
continued also in some form or other. We
are not sure however but the English issue
may become a Weekly one. We shall pro-
bably be enabled to announce more fully
in our next issue what will be done. We
will announce however that the labors of
the present Editor will cease, as Editor, at
the end of the year. This will probably be
no loss, but rather a gain to the paper. And
should the paper be continued, he solicits
for his successor the same support and
indulgence which he has received, hoping
even that the support may be increased
both in a pecuniary way, and by contri-
butions for the paper. He thinks also that
he can promise that the paper will con-
tinue to be as good, if not superior to what
it has been.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Nuisances.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would be difficult for any one even of
ordinarily acute senses not to perceive that
we are passing through what may be called
the fish season. In this city of delicate
odours there are two seasons which are es-
pecially trying upon delicate olfactories.
One of these is the durian season when
the natives revel in the fumes of sulphuret-
ed hydrogen gas which emanates from that,
(to them) exceedingly delicious fruit, and
in which even exotics, of morbid palates
and blunted olfactories seem to delight.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The other season may be called the fish
season, and through which we have just
been passing. The whole year round may
in a certain sense be called the fish season,
but fish, like every thing else has their
special season. During this season junks,
and vessels load fish here for Java and
and other places. The fish it is said are scarce
this season, and the is later. Al-
most every boat which passes now emits a
dead, heavy, oily, fishy smell, which is very
disagreeable. But perhaps we should not
complain, when masters of vessels and
others can endure a cargo of thees fish for
weeks, and they constitute one of the
articles of export. These and the duriens
are nuisances we shall likely have to endure
as long as we remain in Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are however other nuisances of the
same kind, which might, and we think
ought to be stated. One in the highest
authority says that "rather than spend money
for those things which he thinks would
not be beneficial to the country, he would
rather spend it in gathering up the carcas-
es of dead dogs for the purpose of burning
them." Even that would be a step in the
right direction. Not a day passes but we
are disgusted with the floating carcases of
these pariahs, upon the rivers. Especially
in this the case when the water in the river
is low and the tide flows strongly. The
natives too, generally use the water of the
river for drinking, and that without filtering.
So many dead dogs and other carcas-
ses decaying in the river, must necessarily
contaminate the water with decayed animal
matter, and render it unwholesome. In-
deed the river is a common receptacle for
every offel. By a little care on the part of
the city authorities most of these things
might be avoided. An officer should be
appointed, whose business it would be to
attend to the general cleanliness of the riv-
er and city, and a fine should be imposed
upon every one who was caught throwing
any thing of the kind into the river. The
natives of course know no nuances. They
would as soon live in close proximity to a
seri garden or a boat of rotten fish as not,
but we may as well begin to instruct them
now upon that point as at any other time.
And so long as we are on the subject of
dogs, we may as well mention another mat-
ter. The whole country is full of pariahs.
Most of them have no particular owners,
They are a nuisance to every one. Every
wat is swarming with them. Many of them
are nearly starved and are so poor they are
obliged to lean against something when they
attempt to bark. They render night
hideous with theirs howls. Great numbers
of them are also to be found in the streets
and markets. Every pork or venison stand
has its pensioners. Many there are so old
that they have scarcely any hair, others
are covered with scabs. A person can not pass
along without being disgusted. A good
way to get clear of these would be to im-
pose a tax of about two salungs upon,
every dog found about a man's house, ex-
cept one. One good dog, is useful and
they should be allowed one, but for every
additional one make them pay taxes. Our
opinion is that the dogs would soon disap-
pear, but then care would have to be taken
lest they might be found in the river. The
government has no conscienious scruples
about imposing taxes upon other things,
why should it have upon this point?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another nuisance is the pla or seri gar-
dens. The gardens in themselves would be
no nuisance, but they must have rotten fish.
These gardens, and the fish which are put
around the vines are becoming a great nui-
sance to those who live down the river.
They are rapidly increasing too. The fruit
gardens are gradually giving way to them.
We suppose, considering the taxes, the seri
pays better than the fruit. It is as much
as a man's life is worth to pass through the
klong Somrey these days, such is the
stench that meets him. When the wind
blows over these gardens toward our dwel-
lings the stench is unendurable. Often-
times at night in bed we feel like giving
the decree, if we had the power, to have the
vines all pulled up by the roots. The fact
is they should be prohibited within a cer-
tain distance of the city. There are places
just as well calculated for them, suffic-
iently far from the city to be no nuisance,
and still sufficiently near the market. It is
a pity to have the fruit gardens give way to
these abominable nuisances.{{< /news/text >}}

The Rice Crop
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are credibly informed that the fields
of rice planted this year are much more
extensive than in any previous year, and
that the crop up to the present time is very
promising. But there is reported an un-
common prevalence of chills and fever in
several of the gates rice districts, threatening
to diminish the number of reapers, to
such an extent as to create much anxiety
for the ingathering of the harvest. And
it is said that the rice fields about Ayudia,
the old city, are in danger of great damage
from the unusual continuance of the annual
inundation-—that the rice will be ready for
reaping before the flooding of the fields has
sufficiently subsided, in which case the
reaping of it must be very slow and much
of it lost in the water. And furthermore,
there is the want of the usual strong winds
at this season of the year, which not only
occasions the floods to subside the more
rapidly, but also lays the standing grain
all over in one direction, making it com-
paratively easy to reap it. The winds be-
ing variable is said to entangle the grain,
and consequently it can be but slowly in-
gathered, and much of it necessarily lost.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There may be a good deal of truth in
these reports. Still we think they are
overwrought, to which the Siamese are
peculiarly liable, but more especially this
year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of our correspondents says;—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nearly all the country above Bang-
chaw, and a great portion of the low coun-
try, is still much flooded, the water in some
districts being about two or three feet deep
in the fields, and consequently the grain is
slow in coming to maturity. The present
prospects of an abundant harvest, are very
good, but owing to the slowly receding
floods, the bulk of the crop throughout
the district, can scarcely be ready for reaping
before the beginning of the year, or the
middle of January.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/right >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is with sincere pleasure, we solicit the
attention of the Commercial public to the
very satisfactory Report which appears un-
der the heading of official paper, on the
state of the growing Crop in all the differ-
ent districts of our province. Fears were
entertained sometime ago, that the cattle
disease which had prevailed in all the low-
er sections of the Rangoon district, would
very nearly annihilate all prospect of any
crop this year. But these fears are greatly
mitigated by the announcement that not
more than ten per cent of the cultivation
will be lost.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Bassein and Martaban districts,
have both suffered slightly from insects,
but their disastrous work was repaired be-
fore the season was far advanced. Fresh
paddy was planted.  In every other part
of this fruitful province, the hearts of the
husbandman will be made glad, and they
will be led to rejoice next December, over
a harvest as bountiful as any that has been
reaped in many years.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
Borrowed Capital!
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Or, Getting on in the world.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sylvester Rodney was the name of a
young man, in one of our cities, who had
just set up a business for himself on a
limited capital, and everybody, himself in-
cluded, believed he was doing well. To
be sure, his weekly receipts were not large;
neither were his expenses, enormous; and,
by a careful mode of figuring up under the
head of "outlay" and "income" he was
satisfied that the profits of his store were
sufficient to keep his stock good and fur-
nish the necessary expenses of households,
with something in store for a rainy day.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}For a time Sylvester was quite content
with this. He may have had occasional
dreams of an ambitious nature, but he never
allowed them to interfere with his business
matters. For several years he had oc-
cupied the same little store; it had yielded
him enough for home comforts, and surely
he need not ask for more.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But an evil day came to Sylvester
Rodney. Large stores, fine fronts and
genteel clerks were becoming the rage, and
with dismay he saw that many of his friends,
who had started about the same time and
in the same manner as himself, were leav-
ing him far behind. Of course, he could
not say that they were growing rich; it
might be quite the reverse; but they were
certainly making more splendid appear-
ances, and rising far above him, according
to the indications of social thermometers.
Sylvester himself did not notice or feel this
so keenly as his wife. Katy Rodney had been
a great favorite in her circle, and she
formed many friendships she rarely valued;
yet, while the social position of herself and
husband remained the same, others were
climbing the ladder of fame and distinction.
With pain she saw the growing coldness
of one after another of her former compan-
ions; and soon she began to feel really
alarmed.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Sylvester," she said, one day, seizing
the opportunity, "do you not know, dear-
est, that we are losing ground fearfully!
that all our old companions are getting
above us in style and position! see James
Granger. He commenced life when you
did, with hardly more means, and Lizzie
was on the best of terms with me. Now she
never condescends to call upon me, and I
am sure James had no more opportunities
for getting on in the world than you."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I've noticed that for some time, Katy,"
replied the young merchant; "but I am
sure I don't understand it. I cannot help
their success."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"But you can follow their example, Syl-
vester. Do not they do, and make your
mark a few steps higher in the scale."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"All well in sound, Katy; but how to
make the thing work, is the vital question.
I will do anything to please you if I can
only see how it is to be done."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I cannot give the details," she replied;
"that is for you men of business to deter-
mine. Only, I suppose, it is done by put-
ting in more capital and making more
show generally. But I really wish you
would think of it, dear; for it is too bad to
plod on in this way, while others go ahead
with such rapid strides."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sylvester thought the matter over, and
the more he thought the more uneasy he
became. Sure enough, why should he
plod on so slowly while others were masters
of large establishments and making large
displays in the fashionable world? He saw
plainly enough, now, that he had been too
contended, and allowed matters to take
their own way too much. If he would suc-
ceed, he must make bolder efforts to gain
the success he coveted, and strive to keep
pace with his fellows at all hazards.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He was still revolving the idea in his
mind when an old friend, who had been
successful in mercantile affairs, entered the
store. It was a dull day, and, no cus-
tomers being in, the young man broached
the subject nearest his heart.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Mr. Marsh," he commenced, earnestly,
"I am anxious to challenge any business. I
wish to bring it into something of more
importance. I have plodded here so long
that I really tire of the old style."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"That is too apt to be the case with
young business men of to-day," responded
the merchant, Ephraim Marsh. It is a
common error to try to right things, and
I find it almost always brings up disas-
trously. But in what manner do you think
of making this improvement?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I hardly know. I wish to enlarge both
premises and stock. You are older and
can advise me."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I should not care to advise you in such
matters," the other returned, with a shake
of the head. "One man cannot lay down
a line of conduct for another man, and
know what his success will be. You will
be more likely to strike the true plan,
unadvised, than by any kind of counsel."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I feel no fears but that the extension
would bring me additional custom sufficient
to pay the expense incurred. By tact and
talent I think it quite possible to make a
good business stand of this."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Quite likely. Yet let me caution you
against expecting too sudden an increase.
Your old customers will adhere to you,
and new ones will gradually come in.
But in all things be moderate. Do not let
your fancies or your expectations get the
better of your judgment, and take an
Icarian flight, from which you may tumble
headlong."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The young merchant promised to govern
himself, and the counsellor took his leave.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As may readily be supposed, Sylvester
did not long continue in this undecided
frame of mind. He found another coun-
sellor, one who had just retired from busi-
ness, and who had plenty of money to
invest in anything which promised to pay
well. Caleb Broker was his name, and it
was about as proper in its significance as
any name could be. To him, then, our
young merchant made known his wishes
and aspirations. Mr. Broker heard him
through before making any answer.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"You'll have to do it," he then said,
"in order to keep up with the times.
Years ago it would not do for a man to keep
on in the same careful track; but times
have changed now, and we must pace
with them."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The result was that Caleb Broker placed
in the hands of Sylvester Rodney five
thousand dollars, for which the latter gave
the required bonds upon all his property.
Mr. Broker reasoned in this wise: if the
young man felt determined to enlarge his
business, he must have capital, and would
have it. Why not, then, supply him, and
take the risk? If the business proved suc-
cessful, it would be a good investment; if
otherwise, he should keep a sharp lookout
for his money.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The proposed alterations were made,
and the five thousand dollars soon invested,
Sylvester wondered where it all lay when
he once more threw open his store, for
the figures seemed immensely larger than the
increase in his business. Yet he was
surely upon the rights track now, and he
must wait for good results.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One year passed quickly away. To Syl-
vester Rodney it seemed to fly, so rapid
was the passage of weeks and months.
Yet his prospects were no better than one
year before-—all in all, he believed not as
good. The improved style of the store
rendered additional expenses necessary to
the house. New furniture must be pro-
cured; and, when this was done, the old
carpets looked so faded and out of place.
One improvement suggested another, and
rendered necessary the third, till not only
were the profits from trade consumed, but
numerous heavy bills ran up on credit,
which would require to be met sooner or
later. Still the young merchant did not
feel any especial alarm, for he was too
wholly wrapped in the present to contem-
plate the future. Thus it was that Mr.
Broker found him at the end of the year,
when he called for the interest upon the
money.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"It is no matter," he said, with apparent
kindness. "It can be paid or not; the first
year is always the hardest, and, if not con-
venient, it can run on, drawing compound
interest until next year."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This was kindness, indeed.  So thought
Sylvester, and, after stating the many
causes which had rendered the first year
unpromising, he accepted the leniency of
his creditor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A second year passed.  The bills con-
tracted before had now fallen due, while
new improvements and new outlays became
necessary.  Sickness in the family was add-
ed to other misfortunes, and when two
years had elapsed he was in the same con-
dition as before.  Mr. Broker called with
the notes, but Sylvester had no money.
His bank account was nearly drawn, and
he could not raise fifty dollars.  He repre-
sented his affairs to Caleb Broker, and
with many misgivings; for he had really
hoped to see the young man prosper, the
capitalist consented to wait one more year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This time Sylvester bent his energies to
the task, and he succeeded in a measure.
But he had no idea of the gigantic nature
of the task. This thing was needed, that
thing must be done, all requiring an outlay
of cash. Goods must be purchased and
the stock kept up, else nearly all his efforts
were vain. Yet his money in the bank grad-
ually increased, and when the important
day arrived he had about five hundred dol-
lars on deposit. This he would pay, and
surely Mr. Broker would wait a short time
for the balance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The day came at length, and with it
came Caleb Broker.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I hope you find it convenient to pay
the interest of those notes to-day," he
said, blandly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I think I can nearly pay it," was the
answer, "and I hope you will be willing to
await the balance for a few days."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Oh! certainly.  Anything for accommo-
dation, if it is not too great."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Have you the amount of the interest?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"For three years, I suppose, you mean?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Certainly."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"One thousand, one hundred and twenty-
five dollars and twenty-two cents."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Impossible.  It cannot be so much,"
said the young merchant, with a start.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"But here are the figures," returned
Caleb Broker, quietly.  "The interest on
five thousand dollars for one year, at seven
per cent, is three hundred and fifty dollars.
Add this to the principal, and the interest
for the second year is three hundred and
seventy-four dollars and fifty cents.  This
counted in turn will make the interest for
this within a fraction of four hundred
dollars and seventy-two cents.  Add these
together, and you have the result.  Am I
not right!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sylvester Rodney ran over the figures
for a moment.  He was astounded at the
result, for he had made no close calculations
previously.  Strange that it was so, yet
such was the fact.  Then the sum which
he had so carefully saved was less than one
half, after all.  He glanced once or twice
round the store, and then turned to Mr.
Broker, who awaited his answer.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"You are right," he said, "I had not
cast it up, and had no idea it amounted to
so much.  I can pay you a portion of it,
and shall have to ask for a few days' grace
in which to raise the balance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This was readily granted.  The five
hundred dollars were paid over and receipt-
ed for, after which Mr. Broker took his
leave, promising to call in a week for the
remainder, which Sylvester promised should
be ready.  After he was left alone he sat
down, and for nearly two hours busied
himself in reflection and calculation.  At
length some determination seemed to be
reached as he rose, put on his hat in the
most energetic manner and beat his steps
homewards.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The day following was Sunday, but in-
stead of attending church, as usual, Sylves-
ter spent it in the store. For two or three
days following he seemed silent and preoc-
cupied, but when Thursday evening came
he met his wife with a glad smile upon his
features.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Katy, I am a free man once more,"
was his exclamation as soon as they were
alone.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"What do you mean, Sylvester!?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"That I have money at last to pay Mr.
Broker's borrowed capital."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Not all of it?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Every cent?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"But how did you obtain it?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Sold the store, goods and every thing."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Why did you do that when you were
prospering so nicely?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Listen, Katy, and I will show you how
I was prospering. Three years ago, when
I commenced upon borrowed capital, I had
in stock, of my own little capital, over
twenty-five hundred dollars. Supposing
that I used, for various purposes, two thou-
sand of the borrowed money, there would
still remain three thousand to put into stock.
There would be five thousand five
hundred dollars in trade. On last Sunday
I took an inventory of all my stock, and I
found about five thousand dollars still in
trade. Out of this I owed over six hund-
red dollars of interest, besides the prin-
cipal. I found a purchaser at seven thou-
sand dollars, which was just about the
worth of the premises, with my improve-
ments and privileges. After paying off Mr.
Broker, I shall have about thirteen hun-
dred and seventy dollars, which is all we
have in the world except our house and
furniture."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The wife saw how it was, and bowed in
acquiescence to the measure. She loved
a social position, but she had much rather
be humble and respected than as the wife
of a bankrupt.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Broker, on the following morning,
was startled by the sight of a check cover-
ing the entire amount due him, but he
took it in silence, more than half suspect-
ing the truth. Sylvester paid up his
indebtedness to every man, and then had
about one thousand dollars in cash. He
speedily sought a position, nor was he long
in finding honorable employment, where
his stock of ready money turned to excel-
lent account. In a few months he was
enabled to buy a paying interest in a suc-
cessful firm, and to-day he is a leading
merchant in the quiet little city where he
dwells.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was a few months after selling his
store that he read with surprise the announ-
cement that James Granger had failed.
He drew the attention of his wife to the
fact, and remarked—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"You see, Kay— the end of the road.
It is the same one we pursued while en-
devouring to follow their lead, and get on
in the world from borrowed capital."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
To Buddhist Advocate.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Second Answer
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}My Buddhist friend manifestly desires
me to answer his second reply to me, and
I will therefore now do it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He is not willing to allow that the native
Christians of Siam are Christians in name
only and not in heart, because he has "care-
fully observed, that they are much more
strict in the observances of Christian forms
than the Europeans who reside in Siam."
The question is not whether they are better
Christians than the Europeans, but whether
they are real and true Christians. My friend
mistakes the forms of these Roman Catholic
Christians for the religion of Christ, and
therefore wonders why they, who are so
much more strict in the observance of those
forms, are not as well educated, as strong-
minded, as rich and influential as those
careless and negligent Europeans who
call themselves Christians. Now the fact
is that these native followers of Roman
Catholicism are strict in the observance of
the forms of the Romish Church, is no evi-
dence that they are good Christians. The
Pharisees of old were of all men in the
world the most punctilious in the observance
of forms of religion, and forms too, general-
ly sanctioned by the Bible. And yet Christ
pronounced them "hypocrites," "blind
guides" and even put to them the scathing
question "How can ye escape the damna-
tion of hell" And the reason was, that they
had merely the form of godliness without
the power, and were trusting wholly to that.
Now the religion of Christ is manifested in
the life of the professor, by love to God,
and tender compassion toward men. In
other words it is to be like Christ, to imitate
and follow him in his love of pleasing the
Father, and his love of "going about doing
good" to men. Now the question, is do
these native Christian of Siam thus follow
Christ!  Do those negligent and careless
Europeans do this?  If not, the word of
God for it, they are but false Christians,
"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ
he is none of his."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}What my friend says about the careless-
ness and negligence of many European re-
sidents and transient visitors of Bangkok
in regard to the christian religion is but
too true, and I feel very sad in being oblig-
ed to acknowledge it.  But I would beg my
friend to make a distinction between those
European christians, who by their abandon-
ment of the house of God and profanation
of the Lord's day, dishonor Christ and
cause his "name to be blasphemed among
the heathen," and those who honor Him
by assembling themselves together on the
Sabbath to call on His name and study His
word.  My friend may rest assured that all
such Europeans as keep no day "holy unto
the Lord" are christians in name only and
not in heart. It is true that the most of
them are more highly favored than native
Roman Catholic christians in Siam in the
sense that they have a far better education,
stronger mental powers and consequent in-
fluence among men. some of them being
master mariners, some wealthy merchants,
some consuls etc. The chief reason of their
being this more prospered than native
christians is, that they have all been educat-
ed in the light of the Bible, in a land whose
laws and customs have nearly all sprang
from the Bible. Their minds have been
much enlightened and well disciplined by
a christian education in schools, academies,
and colleges under a christian government.
Hence they all bear the christian name.
But those Europeans to whom my Bud-
dhist friend refers, give no evidence that they
ever gave their hearts to Christ, and con-
sequently it does not appear that they be-
long to his church. But such Europeans
as endeavor daily to imitate Christ do in-
deed belong to his Church, and he says
of them that "they are the light of the
world" Wherever the true followers of
Christ are sufficiently numerous to in-
fluence the governments under which they
live, God uniformly blesses those govern-
ments.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now true Christians have long been
numerous enough in England and other
parts of Europe to influence those govern-
ments, some more and some less, according
to the degree of their conformity to Christ.
Consequently those governments have
been blessed of God with far greater light
and power than can be found in heathen
lands. And all the people in those lands,
even though many of them do not love God,
are greatly benefited in this life by the
reflex influences of the word of God upon
them, even as the natural sun is a blessing
"unto the evil as well as the good," and
as the rain is a blessing "to the unjust as
well as the just." And when these merely
nominal christians remove from the land of
their birth into a heathen country, they will
show, to a greater or less extent, this reflect-
ed influence of the Bible upon them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now this is the reason why those Euro-
peans, who so openly and sadly neglect
Christianity in Siam, appear to be more
blessed than the native professors of Christ,
These have never been trained under a
christian government. Those under Roman
Catholic training, have never had the Bible
given to them. The Pope forbids them to
have it entire, and to read and study it by
themselves. They are allowed only to have
garbled parts of the Bible, and those even,
must be clothed with the glosses of the
Roman priests, which are generally greatly
erroneous. How then can it be expected
that they should be as enlightened, intellec-
lectual, influential and otherwise prosperous
as those Europeans, who have lived in the
full and strong light of an entire Bible all
their days!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With regard to the great numbers which
my friend has heard of in Europe, who at-
tempted to test the truth of christianity, first
by ridiculing it, and then seeing no harm
resulting from such conduct, turned to
praising God and praying to Him to see
what might be the consequence of such
devotion, and then finally, seeing that no
apparent good or evil followed either course,
abandoned all confidence in the doctrine of
a living and Almighty God. I would reply
that there may be a few such characters in
Europe, and I suspect here and there one in
Siam,—a most genial atmosphere for breath-
ing such sentiments. But that there are
large bodies of such infidels now in Eu-
rope, I think is a great mistake. But if it
be true that there are very many in Europe,
who have made such an experiment as my
friend has head they made, would he pro-
nounce that a fair trial of the great ques-
tion, whether there be or be not a divine
author of religion-—any Almighty maker
and sustainer of the worlds? And if there be
such a God, would my friend think it at
all suitable or prper tht he should answer
in mercy such prayers and praises, proceed-
ing from hearts of sheer selfishness, and
wrangling with enmity against him!{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But, my friend may ask, why, if there was
in truth an Almight God, who saw the
enmity and mockery, did he not come out
against them at once with his judgments,
and show them and the world that he is?
My answer would be that our God delight-
eth in mercy, and hence bears long with
those who revile and reject him "not will-
ing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance" and accept of
salvation by Christ Jesus; and hence he
prolongs the season of their probation. But
he has said that his "Spirit shall not always
strive with man" When it ceaseth to strive
with those who reject him, then will his
judgments overtake them, as in the days
of Noah; if not in this world, it will in
the future world of everlasting retribution.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It has occurred to me, that my Buddhist
friend possibly has in his mind that time in
France 70 years since, when Robespierre and
his associates, assuming supreme power over
the land, abandoned all religious worship, de-
claring that there is no God, and hence no
religion that man is bound to respect. But
what was the consequence of that inaugur-
ation of atheism? Why, it was most terrific.
The rule of Robespierre and his party has
hence ever since been most fitly denomini-
nated.— The reign of terror. It did in-
deed appear as if God in righteous Judg-
ment poured out upon all classes, the spirit
of terror. The rulers could not trust one
another. The people could not trust their
leaders, nor even their own friends or re-
latives. Envy, jealousy, suspicion, murder
swept over the land like legions of devils
let loose from the bottomless pit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At length, however, the people, coming
to their senses, saw that their country and
themselves with it were drifting rapidly to
destruction on the flood of atheism, and
that the judgments of a righteous God were
out after them for adopting atheism as their
creed. They rose en masse against Robes-
pierre and put him to death, and returned
to the belief and worship of Jehovah and
Jesus Christ our Lord. From that day to
this France has been a christian nation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again my Buddhist friend begs leave to
differ with me as to the causes of England's
prosperity. I had in my previous reply to
him attributed it to the Bible, citing the
answer of Queen Victoria to the heathen
prince. But my friend says that, "England
has prospered because she has given birth
to many good and wise men, and because
she has had an excellent copy of customs
and laws, and her sons have followed right-
eousness, and that for these reasons Eng-
land has become a great nation"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I most readily grant that my friend is
quite correct in attributing England's great-
ness to these causes. But will he allow me to
ask him, How England came by so many
good and wise men? Is not her present excel-
lent Queen right in believing that the Bible
made them? How came England by such
an excellent copy of customs and Laws?
Did she did not get it from the Bible? And
how happened it that her sons have so
many of them followed righteousness? Is it
not because they had been thoroughly
educated in the principles of the Bible? I
affirm that such are the true and most
legitimate reasons for England's present
greatness, and I challenge my friend and
the whole world to disprove it. But I feel
quite pleased! that he has come so near to
my way of thinking. A few more conces-
sions, with the heart united, and he will be
a real Christian.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In regard to the last question my friend
has propounded I have only time to say,
that our God has never made it a principle
in his government to bestow worldly
prosperity upon his people equally. He
oftentimes judges it best to try those whom
he loves with great worldly adversity, that
they may become partakers of his holiness
even as gold is tried in the fire to make it
pure. The Lord Jesus taught this in the
parable of the rich man and Lazarus. But
God will in due time bless his people most
abundantly in heaven. The blessing is only
postponed a little that the heirs of it may
become all the better prepared to enjoy it,
even as a rich and loving earthly father will
until his son is of age, well trained and
well prepared, and then he will confer upon
him a large estate. As it is with indi-
viduals, so it is with nations, of which we
have an example in the Israelites when tried
in the wilderness 40 years, after which they
entered Canaan, and became much enlarged.
And then after this they were under the
training of divine providence five hundred
years until David and Solomon, when the
nation became very great. And we have an
apt illustration of this long training of
nations in the English people for a period
of 1000 years until they became a great
and powerful nation. There is no nation
in Europe that has been so thoroughly a
christian nation as England. And no Euro-
pean nation equals her in extent of
territory, riches, learning, and power.{{< /news/text >}}

Dr. Livingstone on Afr. Missions.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The evidence of Dr. Livingstone, the
explorer, before the Select Committee on
Western Africa, which has just been pub-
lished in England, is entirely contrary to
that of Capt. Burton as to the results of
missions. The doctor was asked whether
he thought it possible that an English
government should be established in the
neighborhood of twenty or thirty different
tribes, and not interfere in their quarrels?
His reply was, "I think so. The mission-
aries whom I have known generally make
it clearly understood they will not inter-
fere in the protection of the country; they
are looked upon as part of the superior
power, and they are not appealed to."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Other questions and answers are as fol-
lows:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q. In the case of Lagos and Abbeokuta,
have the missionaries practically kept out
of the native quarrels? A. I am not acquaint-
ed with Lagos.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q What is your opinion generally of the
character and influence of the missionaries
in Africa? A. I entertain a very high
opinion of them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q. Do you allude to any particular part
of Africa? A. I know them better in the
interior of the south, and in Sierra Leone.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q. Taking Sierra Leone, what should
you say has been the influence of the mis-
sionaries there? A. I think it has been very
beneficial, both to the natives and to the
English.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q What has it done for the natives, in
the first place?  A. The missionaries always
promote trade.  Some of them think they
ought not to attempt the civilization
of the people, and others think that they
ought; but wherever I have seen a mission
established, that mission promotes civiliza-
tion and commerce, whether the mission-
ary professes to be anxious to promote
civilization or not.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Baxter:  You mean promoting civili-
zation by teaching industrial employment?
A. Yes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Chairman: The Committee have
heard of two systems of missionary work
in Africa; one which adopts education and
preaching at its means of action, and one
which seems to have been carried on to a
great extent on the Gold Coast by the
Swiss missionaries, and into which agricul-
tural and industrial training largely enter.
To which system do you chiefly allude? A.
One body of missionaries adopts industrial
pursuits chiefly, but they never confine
themselves to these. The other professes
to be anxious only to preach the Gospel,
but their influence is directed also to pro-
mote the civilization of the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q. Even though it is not connected with
any industrial pursuits? A. Even though it
is not connected with any industrial pur-
suits. One way in which they do that is
by their example; they show an example
of industry, and in that way promote civili-
zation without professing to be industrial
missionaries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q. Do you believe that the missionaries
have ever such a command of the local
language as to be able to preach intelligibly
to the natives? A. I know many who speak
the language thoroughly—far better than
any natives who have been born in the
mission. Mr. Moffatt has been out there
for fifty years, and he knows it thoroughly;
he has translated all the Bible into their
language; he knows it beter than any native
born on the station.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Chichester Fortescue: Which of the
native languages are you alluding to? A.
The Siehnami.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Chairman: The Committee have
heard great doubts expressed with regard
to the influence of the missionaries in Sierra
Leone upon the native character, and we
have had evidence that the natives educated
in the mission schools are generally dis-
liked; can you account for that prejudice or
that opinion in any way? A. It is very
common to hear apprehension cast on the
character of the missionaries; but I account
for it in this way. The lives of these men
generally are a protest against the evil
conduct of many of the men who go out
to trade there; I do not wish to say that
there are not good men among the traders.
but a very large proportion of them are
worthless, and the lives of those mission-
aries are a sort of standing protest against
the moral conduct of the traders. Mr.
Moffat has been laboring with great success
in one tribe for forty-three years, and he is
exceedingly annoyed by several of the
traders who have settled on the spot, and
who have attempted to nullify all his teach-
ing, corrupting the natives by their con-
duct.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q. Is the character of the missionaries
themselves high and unexceptionable? A.
You find a few among them who are not
men of great ability; some of them have
been guilty of improper conduct; but take
them as a whole, I think they deserve a
very high character.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Q. Should you say that their character is
improving and that the class of men sent
out as missionaries is higher than it used
to be? A. When the missionaries were
sent out fifty years ago it was believed by
many men that any sort of man who could
read his Bible and make a wheelbarrow
was sufficient; but it was found that was
a mistake, and the more care is taken in
their selection the more satisfactory are the
results.{{< /news/text >}}

Jonathan to John Bull.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}

BY JOHN G. LAKE.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
"Tempora mutantur."
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/indent3 >}}Dear John! I don't forget

{{< news/indent3 >}}I am something in your debt

{{< news/indent1 >}}For giving me many a ministerial slap;

{{< news/indent3 >}}But, perhaps, the recent news

{{< news/indent3 >}}May have modified your views—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Say, what do you think of it, now, old chap?

{{< news/indent3 >}}Not many months ago,

{{< news/indent3 >}}As you very well know,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Crowing hastily over each Federal mishap,

{{< news/indent3 >}}You swore the rebel crew

{{< news/indent3 >}}Would pat the Yankees through—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Well, what do you think of it, now, old chap!

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent3 >}}Once, running our blockade.

{{< news/indent3 >}}Seemed a money-making trade,—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Spite of many a magnificent Monitor trap;

{{< news/indent3 >}}Bet when you count the cost

{{< news/indent3 >}}Of your ships and cargoes lost—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Say, what do you think of't, now, old chap?

{{< news/indent1 >}}

{{< news/indent3 >}}And how you used to mock

{{< news/indent3 >}}At our solid Union stock;

{{< news/indent1 >}}And then-—to replenish your treasury's gap—-

{{< news/indent3 >}}Took the cotton bounds at par,

{{< news/indent3 >}}(Like a donkey, as you are!)

{{< news/indent1 >}}Well, what do you think of 'em, now, old chap!

{{< news/indent3 >}}Once, the "honor" of the south

{{< news/indent3 >}}Was forever in your mouth,

{{< news/indent1 >}}As oft as you viewed the American map;

{{< news/indent3 >}}But since "cavalier" you see

{{< news/indent3 >}}With "assassin" to agree—-

{{< news/indent1 >}}Say, what do you think of it, now, old chap?

{{< news/indent3 >}}Ah! John—-that little debt—

{{< news/indent3 >}}We will make it even yet,

{{< news/indent1 >}}By giving your gouty old knuckles a rap;

{{< news/indent3 >}}And when that job is done,

{{< news/indent3 >}}We'll have no occasion, John,

{{< news/indent1 >}}To ask what you think of us, now, old chap.

Cure of The Drunkard.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A man, long noted for intemperate hab-
it, was induced by Rev. John Abbott to
sign the pledge "in his own way," which
he did in these words: "I pledge myself
to drink no more intoxicating drinks for
one year." Few believed he could keep
it, but near the end of the year he again
appeared at a temperance meeting, without
having once touched a drop. "Are you
not going to sign again?" asked Mr. Abbott.
"Yes," replied he, "if I can do it in my
own way" and accordingly, he wrote, "I
sign this pledge for nine hundred and
ninety-nine years; and if I live to that time,
I intend to take out life lease!" A few
days after he called upon the tavern-keeper,
who welcomed him back to his old haunt.
"Oh! landlord," said he, as if in pain, "I
have such a lump on my side!" "That's
because you've stopped drinking," said the
landlord, "you won't live long if you keep
on." "Will drink take the lump away?"
"Yes, and if you don't, you'll soon have a
lump on the other side. Come, let's drink
together," and he poured out two glasses
of whisky. "I guess I won't drink," said
inebriate, "especially if keeping the pledge
will bring another lump, for it isn't very
hard to bear, after all; and with this he
drew the lump, a roll of greenbacks, from
his side pocket, and walked off, leaving the
landlord to his reflections.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}A Spaniard and a German held debate
over the relative smartness of the different
nations of the world. "I," said the Span-
iard, "can take an egg from under a sitting
bird without disturbing her." "Do that,"
said the German, "and I will let you see
what I can do." So they went into the
wood and searched till they had found a
tree with a bird's nest near the top of it.
The Spaniard took off his sword, and belt,
and spurs, his rustling silk mantle, and his
cap and plumes, laid them at the foot of
the tree, and began noiselessly to mount.
While he was intent on getting at the nest
the German walked off with the Spaniard's
arms and cap, and cloak and feathers. It
was decreed, therefore, that the German
was the smarter fellow.{{< /news/text >}}
