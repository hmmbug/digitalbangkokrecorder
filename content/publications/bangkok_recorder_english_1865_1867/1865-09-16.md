Bangkok September 16th.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Since our last issue we have been favored
with another short visit from the French
gun boat "Mitraille." The object of her
visit was to receive Mons. Anberet H. I. M.
Consul at this place, who has had leave of
absence from his government to make a visit
home. Mons. Sr Ora Jullien is acting
Consul at present.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is greatly to be regretted that Mons.
Aubaret just before leaving needlessly pre-
cipitated himself into another quarrel with
the Siamese government, and left full of
animosity towards His Majesty the Supreme
King.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It will be remembered that a short time
since we fought some battles with that
functionary for the Siamese, in reference
to the publication of the Treaty concluded
between France and Siam in regard to
Cambodia. But instead of being hand-
somely rewarded for our valour by the
Siamese as we should have been, we were
greatly blamed for what we had done, and
even threatened with suppression. We had
begun to hope, however, that the difficulties
were all past, and that things would hence-
forth move along smoothly, when suddenly
this new difficulty breaks out. Mons.
Aubaret is in this instance so manifestly
in the fault that we cannot refrain from
again espousing the cause of government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The information we have upon this sub-
ject comes from so many and various sour-
ces that it must in the main be true. The
affair is resolved into three distinct and se-
parate scenes which would afford ample
material for a drama had any one the
ability and disposition to take it up. It
appears that the Rev. John Martin a Roman
Catholic Missionary and pastor of Concep-
tion Church, Bangkok, becomes involved in
a quarrel with one of his parishioners Phya
Wisate, a subject of Siam and chief man
among the Cambodian Catholics here. The
French Consul petitioned His Majesty, the
Supreme King of Siam to depose Pha Wisate
and elevate Mons, Lamache a French sub-
ject in His Majesty's employ to a position of
higher rank in the military department. The
reasons assigned for these changes were the re-
ported bad character of the incumbent Phya
Wisate, and that the Consul for France
knew that His Majesty the Emperor of the
France would be extremely gratified by the
promotion of Mons Lamache, and that the
matter should be consummated before the
Consul left for France. To this request
however His Majesty paid little attention.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a few days there occurred the first impos-
ing some of the drama occurred in the
Court Room of Mons Rajaday the Siam
International judge. Mr. Martin and Phya
Wisate were in the International Court, and
a rather loud altercation occurred between
them, which resulted in their Rav-ing each
other hastily.  Mr. Martin then complain-
ed to the Consul for France that Phya
Wisate had called him a liar, and a person
in whom no confidence could be placed.
The Consul for France was very much in-
censed at this, and determined at once to
have Phya Wisate removed.  He immedi-
ately wrote a note to His Majesty the
Supreme King, demanding that Phya Wisate
be at once deposed without stay further in-
vestigation, and if the demand was not
complied with, he would take it as an in-
sult offered by His Majesty to Christianity,
as well as to the French Government, as it
would be an infraction of treaty stipulations.
This note was committed to the care of
Mr. Lamache who arrived at the palace at
2 oclock A. M. a very seasonable hour for
business transactions, and has occurred
scene No. 2.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty had been feeling unwell for
some days, but was that night in pretty bet-
ter and had called some Buddhist priests
for the purpose of holding special devotion-
al service. At this unreasonable hour M.
Lamache made his way into the palace, a
liberty which he had previously not presum-
ed to take, especially at such an hour. At this
sudden and unceremonious appearance His
Majesty manifested some irritation, and
even indignation. He demanded the busi-
ness of the intruder, and it could not
be postponed until morning. M. Lamache
then presented the letter of the Consul which
was perused by His Majesty, who immedi-
ately gave orders to have a suitable inves-
tigation made as early as possible. With
this however M. Lamache was not satisfied,
and said there was no need of any further
investigation, as he himself had heard the
language used by Phya Wisate to Father
Martin. He even ventured to expostulate
a third or fourth time, and his expostula-
tions were such as to border on imprudence.
His Majesty then became very much emerged
and said in language toward Mr. Lamache
which it would not be advisable to repeat,
and the time for Buddhist services having
arrived, he ordered him to leave the palace.
M. Lamache however still persisted in re-
maining, when His Majesty ordered him
to be taken out of the palace, which was
done. M. Lamache of course hastened to
his Consul and had the matter before him:
His Majesty had intended to write to the
Consul for France concerning the matter.
but feeling quite unwell the morning after
the scene occurred it was postponed. At this
postponement, or rather silence on the part
of His Majesty, the Consul for France was
very much enraged, and in haste addressed
a note to His Majesty impeaching him
with unfriendly sentiments towards the
French, and threatening that he would be
in Paris in six weeks and would lay the
matter before the Emperor, and that in the
mean time the French admiral at Saigon
would look after French interests in Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a very short time however, Mom Ra-
joday, the present Siamese International
Judge was sent down to confer with the
Consul for France on the matter, and there
occurred scene No. 3.—No sooner had he
made his business known than, the Consul
picked up the betel box &c. of Mom Raja
day, which had been given him by the king,
and was the insignia of his rank, his
"Khruang Yot" and threw them out of
the house and they were broken by the fall.
Then taking Mom himself by his top-
knot, the tuft of hair so much prized by
the Siamese, he sent him after the betel box.
No greater insult in the eyes of Siamese
could have been offered to one of their of-
ficials. No fitter person, too, could have been
selected by His Majesty for such an er-
rand than Mom Rajoday. He is a Prince
and cousin of His Majesty, and is a man
also who has had much intercourse with
foreigners, and we believe is universally
esteemed by foreign residents here. He
speaks the English language tolerably well
and was one of the ambassadors sent by
His Majesty to the court of England a few
years since. His visit to England was not
wholly lost to him, for he learned much of
European customs while there. We feel
confident therefore in asserting that his
conduct on the occasion, was in every way
gentlemanly, and did not merit the treat-
ment he received. If it was in retaliation
for the treatment received by M. Lamache,
it must be taken into consideration that M.
Lamache is but a French subject in the
Siamese employ, whilst Mom Rajoday is a
Siamese official of high rank. The conduct
of the former was any thing but proper,
whilst the conduct of the latter was in every
way gentlemanly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In this matter it is very evident that M.
Aubaret transcended his powers. Upon
what authority or treaty stipulations did
he as Consul for France demand the depos-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ing of a Siamese official for an offence a-
gainst his church or pastor.—It is a ques-
tion to be settled by the church alone.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is evident also from what has been
transpiring ever since M. Auharet has been
here, that he is not the man to get along
smoothly with the Siamese, and we doubt
if he could get along smoothly any where.
If he return to Siam he must return with
sufficient force, to make Siam virtually a
French province; and that himself be the chief
man in it. If H. I. Majesty brings him out
in such a course he certainly does not pos-
sess the shrewdness we have always ac-
credited to him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The strangest thing however in the
whole affair is that Their Majesties, both
the First and Second kings, gave him a
private audience before he left, and pre-
sented him with tokens of friendship,
which shows how fickle this people are, and
how likely to be swerved from any straight
forward course.{{< /news/text >}}

Garden Rambles in Siam.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 158)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Right merry must be the harvest-home
of the Laos at the north. This transport,
which I (Grandjean) have often witnessed,
is made in too curious and too amusing a
manner not to have a word about it. They
beat the rice upon the field where they
have collected it; this when the grain is
gathered into heaps; they go every morning,
each with a train of fifteen, twenty, or thir-
ty oxen. The first of these oxen, that is,
the one which walks at the head of the
troop, generally has the head covered with
garlands, surmounted with a bunch of pea-
cock's feathers, and the neck surrounded
with little bells. All these animals have
two kinds of baskets, on their backs, which
hang on each side, and which are filled
with rice, after which they return to the
city, (Cheangmai) making a dreadful bustle;
for the bridge which is at the gates of the
city, not having a breadth of more than two
fathoms. The convoys which are [...]ering
come in contact with those going out. A
general melee results. Each one runs hither
and thither to find his wandering cattle;
the shouts of the drivers and the [...] of
of the oxen are mixed with the ringing of a
thousand bells. The elephants, at a grave
place, come into the p...[ this rout with
large bells, which each have a differ-
ent tone; then the buffaloes, scared by the
ringing, open, by charging all in the breach,
a merciless gap followed by their masters,
who cry, 'Nen tua ha di Hhuai Sonak!'
that is, Take care, take care! a mad buffalo!
At last, the idle spectators, who gather in
crowds, increase the tumult more by their
cries and their incessant shouts of laughter.
The whole makes a truly comical affray—a
scene made up of the trunks of elephants,
horns of oxen, of Laconian sticks, which rise,
fall, and cross in all directions; and the
spectacle, which commences at break of day,
is prolonged until nine or ten o'clock, the
time when the carrying is stopped, because
the sun has become too hot. Such, for some
is the labor, for others the sport, of the
month of January.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The cultivation of sugar-cane, introduced
some fifty years ago by the Chinese, is
conducted chiefly by Siamese, who sell on
the field to the former. Planted in June or
July, and cut in latter December, it is car-
ried to the huge, uncouth mills which is of-
ten both the work-place and home of a
hundred or two Chinamen. The juice,
ground out between hard-wood cylinders,
turned by buffalo-crank, is boiled down
over heavy-fires, granulated in coarse earth-
en vessels of two or three gallons, and pur-
ified with quick-lime. In February excel-
lent sugars are in market. The quotations
for 1859 ranged from four-and-a-half to el-
even ticals, two dollars and seventy cents
to six dollars and sixty cents per piculs the
export reached two hundred and three
thousand five hundred and ninety-six piculs,
or twenty-seven million one hundred and
forty-six thousand one hundred and thirty-
three pounds, (about one-eighteenth of the
product of the United States,) being ship-
ped to Cinna, Singapore, Bombay, England,
and (though at little profit) to San Fran-
cisco.  A very choice and much used con-
fection, is the 'rock-candy,' large semi-
transparent crystal sugar.  The inferior
molasses-drainings, sold at about two dol-
lars and fifty cents per jar of thirty-five gal-
lons, are much used to give a tenacity to
shell-lime mortar, and finish to stone-lime
plaster.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next to betel, rice and sugar, ranks, as
a necessity, tobacco.  In the Siamese it is
termed 'medicine'; but if only used medi-
cinally they are a miserably sickly people,
and that from the cradle to the grave.  They
commence its use at a period considerably
more remote than that to which memory
runneth back.  It is not an exceedingly rare
sight to see young Siam, in her mother's
arms, alternate draughts at the fountain of
life with whiffs of the light cigaretto:
though she does not abandon the maternal
spring as early, by a year or two, as the
child of the West. We have often seen one,
just tottering about the house, hold a cigar
between her fingers, and puff away the blue
clouds with all the daintiness and gusto of
one in other lands, who had made it a life-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}long study and delight. The cigars, of fine
tobacco covered with dry plantain-leaf, are
skilfully lodged when not in actual service
over the ear, masculine or feminine. Large
quantities are chewed with betel. Indeed,
the Siamese have reached that highest
grade of civilization and refinement, of
which 'the use of the weed' is an index.
The production of coffee, though of late
date, has resulted in a good quantity and
quality. Under foreign management and
cultivated on the uplands, (on the low the
root runs down into the water, and the tree
too soon die,) it would, according to the
best judgment, become an extensive export.
It is, however, mostly drunk by foreigners,
and offered at entertainments of the weal-
thy; tea, imported, being the usual bever-
age. Hemp, of the finest strength and dur-
abilty, and cotton of different varieties, are
grown to some extent. The natives cleanse
the latter from seeds, etc., between two
wooden cylinders, revolving, by hand, in
opposite directions; beat it with rattan or
whip-bow, roll it with fingers, and reel and
weave it on machines very like those now
antique at home. The gigantic 'silk cot-
ton tree, with 'showers of scarlet lily-
shaped blossoms,' offers the soft, downy
contents (too short and brittle for yarn or
cloth) of its pods for cushions, pillows and
beds. The export of cotton, chiefly in
Hainan-Chinese junks, and difficult of es-
timate, was in 1858, two thousand three
hundred and thirty-four picols, or three
hundred and eleven thousand two hundred
pounds, at about sixteen ticals, nine dollars
and sixty cents per picol, for clean; prices
in 1859 ranged from eight to twenty-five
ticals, four dollars and eighty cents to fif-
teen dollars for cleaned and uncleaned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The treaties of 1855 and 1856 with
Great Britain, the United States, (nego-
tiated by the Hon. Townsend Harris,) and
France, with the consequent entrance of
western science, machinery, capital and
energy, are already and wonderfully stimul-
ating and developing the agricultural re-
sources of the country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Yet, beside the fruit and the vegetable,
are the flower-gardens of Siam. The peo-
ple, from high to low, are exceedingly fond
of flowers. Young children wear them cir-
cled around the top-knot or the head, and
around the neck. The women net, of flow-
ers, seeds and buds, fragrant and beautiful
hanging ornaments of different forms, some
resembling lampelles. Persons are some-
times seen with flowers swinging from
mole-hairs on the skin. Coolies, digging
our trenches, besmeared from the sole of
the foot to the very tip of the tuft with
mud, frequently carried them over the ear
to regale themselves at intervals. In and
around the capital are many gardens de-
voted exclusively to their culture for the
royal palace, and for state, festal and fun-
eral displays. A large area in rear of a pa-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}lace, near which was our city home, bloom-
ed with roses, from which was paid the ro-
yal tribute of a magnate. The daily quota
of other princes and nobles was made up
of other flowers. Portions of the royal pa-
lace grounds are filled with the richest and
rarest, native and exotic. The temple
grounds are gay with plats, parterres and
vases; and the edifices themselves, ever re-
dolent of sweetest perfumes exhaled from
flowers, festooned from pillar to pillar, and
vased before the idol-shrines. [Here too the
banian, with shoots descending and root-
ing in the earth, 'enlarges and beautifies its
leafy palace,' but not in Indian frequency,
magintude and magnificence. And the
sacred fig, another banian though not root-
ing from the branches, spreads its delight-
ful tranquil shade, beneath which Gaudama,
after long profound contemplation and div-
ers works of merit, became Buddhas.  Re-
probate indeed is he who would break
limb, or do other dishoonor to it.] The lotus
of lotuses, 'a truly magnificent flower,
whose rosy petals, half-opening, emit a
sweet perfume from numerous golden stam-
ina; the exquisite nyctanthus; the olean-
der, 'pride of the jungle,' larger than the
largest home-lilac; the honey-suckle, the
jasmin, the pink, the amaranth, the heliot-
rope, the passion-flower, the cactus, the lily,
and others, many unknown to the West.
But the whole country is a garden of flow-
ers; they cluster in myriads beneath and
upon and amid fruit, shade and forest-trees
and shrub and plants, arraying all, at the
early rainy season, with variegated leaves
and blossoms, in more than queenly glory,
and breathing odors we might well imagine
celestial. The mangrove is the first and
the last to the sight of the coming and de-
parting visitor of Siam. Outskirting the
river-mouths and the gulf-shores, it is at
once a great conservative and aggressive.
It protects the banks from wasting currents
and tides; but more than this, it pushes far
out and invades the waters. Its lower
branches bend beneath the weight of the
long clavate, or oblate spheroid fruit, which
germinate, root, and spring up new plants,
more and more remote from land. With
their long, strong, arched and interlacing
roots, they plunder from the passing waters
floating dirt, weeds, sticks, soil, and invite
to their protection muscles, and other shell-
fish. Thus they slowly narrow and fill the
channels, and bring the shore to themselves.
But their policy is, like that of many who
'remove old landmarks,' fatal; when
their ultra on-reaching successors have shut
out from them the daily visits of the salt
waters, they are said to wither and die.{{< /news/text >}}

The Brothers Leinhardt.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from page 149.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Very soon after, Hans Andersen—the
rich Hans Andersen—died in a fit: just as
my poor man might:  It had seemed to
the simple folks that even death, "the
mighty leveler," most respect so great a
man; and a sort of wonder mingled with
their lamentation.  Many relations whom
he had neither known nor loved came
mourning to his funeral; but when his will
was read, it was found he had bequeathed
his whole possessions and effects to his
good neighbor Frans as one who would
not equaled or abune riche.  "As rich as
Hans Andersen!"  Yes every rood and
sherd that once were his, now called Frans
Leinhardt master.  He had reached the
highest pinnacle of his ambition, and sat
in the sun, nay wore the coat, and stood
in the shoes, of him he had most envied;
still I doubt if he were half so happy, with
all his wealth and consequence, as his
brother poor and struggling for each day's
bread, but crowned with the tender love of
wife and children.  Year after year had
rolled away, till many had joined the ages
past and laid their irrevocable record of
good and evil deeds before the throne of
God; and the solemn slow moving years,
as they passed, had hardened Franz's heart,
and marked his face with wrinkles.  The
little brown house still stood amid the
broad, smiling fields, and huge barns,
strong and sturdy as of yore; and it would
have puzzled a good guesser to say which
was the older—the dry brown old house
or the brown dry-looking old man who
lived in it:  both looked as if they might
have challenged King Time to a trial of
strength, and come off victorious.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The great barns and out-houses were full
to overflowing with earth's richest harvests,
as in the days when Franz Leinhardt, the
wood-cutter, gazed enviously at them from
his cot on the mountain side. Plenty and
to spare Franz had, but there had been
little comfort or happiness in the little
brown house since he called himself its
master. No weary wayfarer blessed his
hospitality, nor eager children gleaned the
scatterings of his fields: he saved money to
make more money, to save more money,
not to purchase his own ease or luxury, or
to do good to others. Forsaking all other
pleasures and affections, he loved Mammon
only, and toiled and slaved for gold. 'Twas
all he had to love. No wife had gladdened
the little brown house with her loving
smiles, nor children's voices woke its slum-
bering echoes. 'Women,' he said, 'were
extravagant and lazy; they were silly and
useless: and he was not rich enough to
keep a wife in idleness;' but I doubt if
any of the fair-haired, blue-eyed maids of
Lundkoping would have had him for all
his gold. But while wealth flowed into
the strong box of Franz, and stuck there
as if wedged and welded fast, Flemming's
little stock of worldly goods had found
wings and flown away, and turn which
way he would he found himself pursued by
an overwhelming tide of ill fortune; yet was
there many a honey-drop in his bitter cup.
Christina, no longer rosy-cheeked and dim-
ple-handed, was as tender and true as in
the May-day of their love, and met fate
bravely, toiling early and late to helpto pro-
vide for the six sturdy children who made
her merry with their laughter. It must be
admitted, however, that highly as these
heart-treasures are prized by their posses-
sors, (and I have heard very poor men say
worlds could not buy one them,) they are
more likely to drag a man down to the
mire of poverty, than raise him to the sun-
ny plains of affluence. Through all these
years while Franz was growing richer and
richer, Flemming was slipping down the
grim descent till he landed at the bottom
sick and penniless. His good wife wept
and prayed and toiled; but eight mouths
are hard to fill, and one cold bleak winter
day found the young Leinhardts keeping a
forced fast, with no corresponding feast in
prospect. The mother sat beside her sick
husband with despair in her face, till the
tears and lamentations of her children were
unendurable; and throwing a shawl over
her head, she sallied out in the drifting snow
and blustering wind to try if, after years of
estrangement, Franz could not be moved to
part with some of his hoarded wealth to
save his kindred from famine. She toiled
along the rough road in the face of a storm
that nearly blew her away, without feeling
much of its fury, for her heart was in her
poverty-stricken home; but when she reach-
ed the little brown house she trembled,
hesitating to supplicate the pity of a man
so hard and unrelenting.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}She peeped timidly in at the window:
Franz was sitting in a large arm chair, be-
fore a great blazing fire, smoking his pipe
with dreamy satisfaction. On the mantle
before him there stood a quaint old clock,
and while she gazed the wheels began to
whirr, and out popped a queer little man
in a red night-cap, holding a tiny bag in
each hand, which he elanked together three
or four times, nodding and rolling his old
little head all the time. Franz took the
pipe from his mouth and nodded gravely
to the little mannikin, which darted into
the clock again, and all was silent. Four
o'clock! Already night was closing in, the
snow fell in thicker flakes, and the wind
grew each moment more blustering—the
poor woman felt there was no time to
lose. Her timid knock brought Franz to
the door, and with a broken voice and
sinking heart she began her story; but no
sooner did he understand that she wanted
help than he motioned her impatiently from
the door, saying: "Go, go; am I to blame
that my brother is a fool and has a pack of
children? Had he minded me he would
have had no such plagues. 'Tis only
worthless idle people who are poor and
need help. I wont encourage imprudence
and mismanagement." "But my husband
is sick; how can I leave him to work for
my children!" sobbed poor Christina.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Let him go to an hospital, be industrious
and frugal and take care of your children.
'tis your business, not mine," returned
Frans roughly. "Ah me!" cried the poor
woman, clasping her hands, and raising her
tearful eyes to the stormy sky, "it is night
and winter, my children are starving, surely
I shall go mad;" and as she turned sadly
away, she said, "I pray God the gold that
he so hardened your heart may never
weigh so heavy on your soul that you
cannot mount to glory," and with a bowed
head and slow step she disappeared in the
storm and darkness. Frans stood looking
after her with something like remorse in
his heart, till night shrouded her from his
view, and he returned to his bright fire, his
arm chair, and his pipe; but a spell was on
him-—nothing seemed so cheery and com-
fortable as it had done before that woman
came. If he looked into the fire he saw
faces there that he did not want to see; in
the dark corners of the room were shadows
of drooping figures; from among the old
carvings and mouldings looked out thin
famine-worn visages; and the old clock kept
ticking over Christina's words: "Pray God
the gold that has so hardened your heart
may never weigh so heavy on your soul
that you cannot mount to glory."{{< /news/text >}}

My voyage to Havana.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The voyage will benefit your health, dear
Maud; it is just what you need. Really, I
think you had better go."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thus urged my husband over a letter re-
ceived that day, containing an urgent invi-
tation for me to spend the winter, in Hav-
ana, with some dear friends I had not met
for years.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I could not feel it best to go. We two
were alone, Edward and I. For ten years we
had lived in out quiet, beautiful home, hap-
py in our love, which drew us closer as the
years went by. Happy, except that the
shadows, which always will gather where
there is no bright sunshine from child-eyes,
had settled in scarcely defined forms around
our hearth-stone. I tried to think Edward
felt their presence less than I—-he was out
all day, while I often sat alone, and heard
the echo of sweet baby tones and tender,
motherly endearments in my neighbors'
homes, till the shadows seemed to wrap me
like a cloud, and some drops fell.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Edward could not go to Havana, and,
anxious as I was for the sight of the dear
faces who would meet me there, I was very
loth to go alone. But it was true Dr. Bry-
ant had advised just such a trip, and my
health was failing. My husband was firm
in the conviction that it was "just the thing,"
and promised to write daily, while he urged
that it would be only "a little while." A-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}shamed to write a refusal to my friends with
no better reasons to give for it, and with
father, mother and sisters united in think-
ing I must go, I foresaw that I must yield,
even while I was resolving to have not to
do so until the morrow.  I went to rest that
night troubled and rebellious; feeling that
it must be best for me to go, yet with my
heart strangely clinging to home, dear home.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}How short the time seemed till I was on
my way to Cuba!  The editor had been
spoken; our steamer was gaily plowing on
her course over the Atlantic waves under
a lovely October sky, and I, under the
guardianship of Captain Henderson, and
duly equipped with all the necessary com-
forts and luxuries suggested by my numer-
ous friends, was really making my first
voyage.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The few ladies and gentlemen who were
my companions were pleasant, social and
intelligent, and we had a few days of pleas-
ant sailing under auspicious skies with fair
winds. Then came a fearful, terrible change.
I can remember but little of the events suc-
ceeding the storm that broke over us, ex-
cept the dreadful certainty; at last that we
were to be wrecked. Our vessel was beaten
upon the rocks, and probably all must per-
ish. Then a long, long struggle with the
wild, pitiless waves as I clung convulsively
to a piece of board; one of the crew gave
me when the wreck broke up and we were
all washed away. Then drifting away—away
from all, and feeling that I alone was left,
and no one could be saved. Then one last
thought of husband, mother, friends, home
and life, and then—utter unconsciousness
and oblivion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
* * * * *
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Very dim are my memories of what next
occurred, even after life and consciousness
were partially returned. Strange figures
stalked about my bed, and words were spok-
en whose meaning I tried in vain to fathom;
all was dark, blank and desolate. Utter
weakness and prostration oppressed me. I
could remember nothing—understand noth-
ing. My voice sounded strangely in my
own ears, and I uttered words I had not
proposed. Soon another change. I was
stronger—walking, talking and mingling with
human beings whose words actions seemed
uncouth, erratic and absurd even to my be-
wildered sense. I could recall the past on-
lurid reigments and snatches of memory, and
these made me frantic with grief and desire.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One day it all came back to me, Edward's
face, my home, the wreck, my combat for
life amid the waters, all passed before me.
I was alone. I raised my head and looked
around. A small room, neatly but sparing-
ly furnished, a little white bed on which I
lay, a chair and table. The window had an
out-look over green lawns, winding gravel-
led walks, and tall, waving, blossomy trees.
All strange. Where was I;{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A negro woman came in. I saw her face
light up as she met my eyes, and when I
asked the above question, she broke out
joyfully—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Bress God, missy, youse, come to yerself!
Youse this sick, honey," she added, impres-
sively, "an' I'll tell ye all about it, only slow
like. An' ye must tell the doctor where yer
friends be; an' it’s all right now;"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And sincere joy shone from her wrinkled,
black face.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Very soon after I knew all. I had been
picked up by some poor tar boilers on the
coast of North Carolina; had been resusci-
tated with great difficulty; had lain ill in
one of their cabins for months, attended by
the wide of its owner, and, and when my strength
returned, reason did not. Failing to find
any clew to my former home, they had
placed me in the State Lunatic Asylum,
where I now was. It was two years since
I left my home in New York to make that
fatal trip to Havana.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I would not wait to let Dr. Hunter send
any word to my friends in the north. He
was very kind—-supplied me with funds for
the journey, and made arrangements, I scarce-
ly know, for me to be passed through the
lines of the army. I was fast approaching
my home.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I arrived in New York at nightfall. Ev-
ery thing seemed familiar. I had come to
the same depot many times on returning
from short trips to the country. I took a
carriage, and gave the driver the street and
number of my residence, scarcely realizing
that a day had passed since I last did so.
He stopped at the familiar door, assisted
me to light, rung the bell, and then drove
away. I stood, scarcely realizing anything,
waiting for the opening of the door. It was
opened by one of the servants I had left in
the house. I forgot for the time my long
absence, and wondered why she ran away,
after gazing for a moment, like a frightened
creature, leaving me standing in the hall.
then, remembering that they must have be-
lieved me dead, I passed on to the parlor,
with a strange heart-sinking and foreboding
of evil. In my haste and impatience to
reach my home, I had not thought that
changes might have occurred, within it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Scarcely had I entered the room when I
heard the step of Edward, my husband, in
the hall. Every foot-fall brought freshly be-
fore me the happy days when I had listened
for them at this hour. He came directly
to the parlor. I stood near the centre of
the room, with the light shining full upon
my face. I could not feel that it had been
so long since we parted, and half expected
only the usual kiss and light-hearted great-
ing of old.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why did he cower and turn so white?
Sinking upon his knees, he moaned pitifully—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Maud! My God! it is Maud!"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I cannot tell you how, but after a while I
knew all. I think my mother came to us,
and told me, while I sat there trying to
keep from going mad with grief and agony.
I remembered I had a deep longing to be
back again in the little white room at the
asylum.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Ellis, in which I had sailed, had been
believed, without a doubt, to be lost, with
all on board. Edward had mourned for me
for months, refusing to be comforted. But
now—he had been married to cousin Lillie
for nearly a year; and the new wife, with
her baby only a few days old, was lying in
the room above me! I do not know how I
broke away from the house, and gained the
street. I walked on and on, swiftly. I
would not remain to cloud their joy. No,
No! Better be, as they had thought, dead
and buried beneath the waves! I reached
the river, and stepped quickly upon a ferry
boat, of which the bell was ringing. The
next moment I had plunged from her side.
into the waves. I struggled, and—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Edward stood at the dressing glass, care-
fully arranging his neck-tie, and the break-
fast bell was sounding:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Well, Maud," he said, gayly, "am I to
tell captain Henderson to reserve the best
state room in the Elks for your trip to Ha-
vana?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I shuddered.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Edward," said I, very decidedly, "I shall
not go!"{{< /news/text >}}

Dancing
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}   Dr. Edie, one of the best Biblical schol-
ars of this age, says in his Cyclopaedia:
   From a collection of all the passages in
Scripture In reference to dancing, it may
be inferred:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}1. That dancing was a religious act;
both in true and in idol worship.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}2. That it was practised exclusively on
joyful occasions, such as national festivals
or great victories.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}3. That it was performed on such occa-
sions only by one of the sexes.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}4. That it was performed usually in the
day time—in the open air—in highways,
fields and groves.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}5. That men who perverted dancing
from a sacred use to purposes of amuse-
ment were deemed infamous.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}6. That no instances of dancing are
found upon record in the Bible, in which
the two sexes united in the exercise, either
as an act of worship or amusement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Lastly. That there are no instances upon
record in the Bible of social dancing for
amusement, except that of the "vain fel-
lows" void of shame alluded to by Michael;
of the religious families described by Job,
which produced increased impiety and
ended in destruction; and of Herodias,
which terminated in the rash vow of Herod,
and the murder of John the Baptist,{{< /news/text >}}

Correspondence.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
To the Editor of the Bangkok Recorder
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir—The communication of R. S. S.
addressed to the journals of this place upon
the subject of supplying a new copper or
bronze coin to take the place of the abom-
inable lead coin now in circulation has elic-
ited a spark or two, which have made their
appearance in the columns of your contem-
porary. If nothing else, they enlighten the
community as to some of the proposals
which have been made to the Siamese
government. The communications all a-
gree as to the necessity of a new coin, but
there appears to be some difference of op-
inion as to the best mode of supplying it.
Only two tangible modes of supplying the
coin appear to suggest themselves. One is
to apply it from abroad and the other is
to make it here. I think the government
will be reluctant to try either way, so long
as they can supply the present lead coin
with such an advantage. They are issuing
rapidly every day, and sending them out to
draw all the silver they can into the treasury.
It is true several attempts have been made
to counterfeir them, and that rather suc-
cessfully, but these attempts have been on
a very small scale, so small indeed that the
government considered it had little to fear
from imposition, and dismissed the culprits.
The coin too is like the Chinese cash, in
itself so small that it does not pay
to counterfeit it. The necessities of the
community however demand a better coin.
The people also demand it. The ats will
soon be all the change in circulation less
than a tical. The old salunga and fuangs
are fast disappearing and no new ones are
appearing. Those still in circulation are
so much worn that it is difficult to pass
them.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is no doubt but that it would be
much more profitable for the government to
make the coin themselves, than to farm it
out to some one of the foreign merchants.
But the question arises can they do it ?
Says one they have a mint and would it
not be for the interest of the government
to import from Europe good dies &c. It
must however be acknowledged, that the
mint is in part a failure. The new fiat
tical has been referred to as an evidence of
the inability of the Slaves of themselves to
produce a good coin. The fault however
I think, is not in the producers, but in the
idlers. The impression is so shallow that it
requires but a short time to efface it. The
miners too require to be taught how to
use a fiat coin. They try the genuineness
of the coin by throwing it down upon a
hard board, or upon the brick pavement.
No coin would stand such usage. To pro-
duce a good coin therefore they need first
of all good machinery, good dies &c. I
learn that they have a new mint on the way
out from England. They have also sent
to the U. S. Mint in Philadelphia for draw-
ings which are on the way out. Next to a
good mint they need a steady practical man
to superintend it. No one can deny that the
person, at present in charge of the mint has
done well. He picked the machinery up out
of confusion and with no one to instruct or
direct him put it in working order. They
used however a practical man to take charge
of the mint and for proper wages they can
get such a one. They have been exceedingly
unfortunate in the Europeans they have
already had'nt work on their mint, but they
have not had the right kind of men. They
have for the most part been simply engineers.
They have mostly been too, addicted to
intemperance so that how capable soever
they may have been of performing the work
they could scarcely be trusted. The Siamese
it is true have almost lost confidence in
European workmen, and it is no wonder
from the specimens they have usually had
about them. They are themselves however
much to blame for this as they generally try
to get a cheap article, and sometimes get
supplied to there hearts content. But by
paying proper wages they can get a good
sober steady man who has had some ex-
perience in such business. With a good
mint therefore and a good overseer it would
undoubtedly be more profitable to the gov-
ernment to make their own coin. But the
supply would be obtained much quicker,
and be attended with much less trouble, to
accept the offer of "R. S. S."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The elections are now over. The battle
has been fought, and it has resulted, as we
expected it would, in great gain to the
Liberal cause. The members of the Cabin-
et have met again in Downing-street, and
have felicitated each other on their com-
mon victory. It is calculated that they
are stronger than they were by twenty-four
votes. But every victory has its drawbacks.
Success is dearly purchased. If there be
not, as often happens, any humiliating
episodes, there are commonly some heavy
losses to deplore. And assuredly in this
case the victors are not without their "but-
cher's bill." Lord Palmerston has lost a
congenial colleague at Tiverton. Lord
Russell has to bewail the failure of his son.
Mr. Gladstone, though returned for South
Lancashire, is smarting under his defeat at
Oxford. Sir Charles Wood has been com-
pelled to change the representation of a
populous constituency for a nomination
borough. And such things are not pleasant.
But, on the whole, they have pulled through
in a very satisfactory manner; and nothing
is more certain than that "Conservative
reaction" is only a pretentious bubble.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But success has its own particular dan-
gers; and all who wish well to the present
Government and to the Liberal cause, hope
that prosperity will not render her Ma-
jesty's Ministers over-confident in their
stability.  Above all they must not think
that they have nothing to do.  The fact is
that they have a great deal to do.  They
must justify the expectations of the major-
ity by proving that they are not merely
Liberals in name.  In this respect there is,
perhaps, a good omen in Mr. Gladstone's
rejection by the University of Oxford.  As
representative of a large and Liberal con-
stituency he is likely to work with more
free and unembarrassed action than in his
old seat, and more may be looked for on
the side of progress from the member of
South Lancashire than from the academical
nominees.  In this respect, perhaps, we shall
see that adversity has its uses, and that
what is Oxford's loss may, in the end, be
England's gain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With the termination of the election
contests comes a season of repose. There
are some candidates, successful and unsuc-
cessful, who are indirectly disposed to
fight their battles over again in the news-
papers, and to bandy "amenities," but the
instances of these are not numerous. On
the whole, the victors have used their suc-
cess with moderation, and the vanquished
have taken their defeat with praiseworthy
good-temper and philosophy. The ten-
dency now is, after a fortnight of excite-
ment, to subside. "Gentle dulness" will
now reign supreme. The London season
is over. People are rushing into the coun-
try and to the seaside, or crossing the Chan-
nel in search of new scenes on the continent
of Europe. The Queen is going abroad.
The Prince of Wales is exploring his
duchy in Cornwall. Prince Arthur is go-
ing to Wales to inaugurate a statue of the
Prince Consort at Tenby; and he whom
the Times this morning describes as "the
ruler of all the Indies" (Sir Charles
Wood), has betaken himself in search of
renewed health and strength to the German
baths. The clubs are already well-nigh
deserted, the state of the parks proclaims
the exodus of the "Upper Ten Thousand,"
and holiday-time at the public offices has
fairly commenced.{{< /news/text >}}

America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Intelligence has been received from New
York to the 15th inst. The four persons
sentenced to death for complicity in the as-
sassination plot were, as we stated in our
last, hung at Washington on the 7th inst.
The American papers give the following
details of the executions:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The order for their execution was read
to the prisoners on the 5th instant. Payne
and Mrs. Surratt heard it with quiet resign-
ation; the latter, however, earnestly begged
for four days' more time in order to prepare
herself for death. Harrold was quite over-
come, and wept bitterly, while Atzerodt
was paralyzed with terror. Mr. Clampit,
one of the counsel for Mrs. Surratt, pro-
cured a writ of habeas corpus from Judge
Wylde, which was served upon General
Hancock on the morning of the 7th. In
answer General Hancock appeared in court,
and stated that his reason for not making
the required return to the writ was in con-
sequence of the suspension of the writ by
the President. The following endorsement
upon the writ was then read:—'Executive-
office, July 7, 1865. Major-General Han-
cock, commanding. I, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, do declare
that the writ of habeas corpus has been
herebefore suspended in such cases as this,
and I do hereby especially suspend this writ,
and direct that you proceed to execute the
order of the Military Commission, and you
will give this in return for the writ. AND
REW JOHNSON. Harrold's sister and Mrs.
Surratt's Daughter Anna appeared early in
the morning at the White House to inter-
cede for clemency, and craved an interview
with the President, who had, given an inperit-
ive orders to admit no one. The grief of
Miss Surratt is said to have been pitiful.
Failing in all her efforts in behalf of her
mother, she finally sunk senseless upon
the steps of the executive mansion. Payne
is said to have earnestly declared Mrs. Sur-
ratt to be innocent, and to have exhibited
the greatest anxiety that she should not
suffer death. Even up to the hour of the
execution; it was generally expected that
Mrs. Surratt's sentence would be commuted.
From the time of hearing their doom the
prisoners were constantly attended by their
spiritual advisers, Payne's religious per-
suasion being Baptist, Mrs. Surratt's
Roman Catholic, Harrold's Methodist, while
Atzerodt selected a Lutheran minister. At
one o'clock p.m. the 27th inst., the prisoners
left the prison building for the gallows in
the courtyard. Mrs. Surratt had to be
supported. She was closely attended by
Fathers Wiget and Walter. Next came
Atzerodt, trembling and utterly unnerved.
Payne followed attended by the Rev. Mr.
Gillett.  He walked firmly, displayed no
bravado, but manifested in no way the
slightest fear.  Harrold was pale and sub-
dued in manner, but walked unaided.
Having reached the scaffold, Payne and
Harrold, through their ministers, thanked
General Hartruft for his uniform kind-
ness to them in their imprisonment.  Pray-
ers were then conducted, after which,
all being in readiness, the prisoners were
brought forward, bound, and the halter of
each adjusted.  Payne throughout main-
tained his firmness, Harrold being partial-
ly unconscious, Mrs. Surratt calm, and At-
zerott quaking with terror.  The latter
alone spoke upon the gallows, saing. 'Good-
bye, gentlemen.  May we all meet in an-
other world.'  At half-past one o'clock the
trap was sprung, the four culprits falling
simultaneously.  There was no struggle on
the part of Mrs. Surratt; she seemed to die
without suffering a moment's pain. Harold
struggled a little, but soon was quiet; and
Atzerott seemingly died easy. Payne, how-
ever, appeared to suffer greatly. The fall
did not break his neck, and he writhed and
heaved his body terribly, sometimes draw-
ing himself up as in a sitting posture.  In
six minutes all were dead.  After hanging
about twenty-six minutes the bodies were
cut down, placed in coffins, and at once
buried in the prison yard.  The affair was
conducted in a most orderly manner, and
was witnessed by about three hundred per-
sons, including the reporters for the press.
When about to rise from her chair for the
purpose of being pinioned, Mrs. Surratt in-
quired of her spiritual adviser what she
should say on the scaffold, and upon being
answered, 'Oh, nothing—what do you de—
sire to say?" replied, 'That I am innocent.'"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The execution has been much discussed
by the American press. Some journals
defend the course of the authorities, and
endorse the sentence and execution as both
just and expedient, while others, especially
the anti-administration journals, assert that
the military commission pronounced sen-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}tence upon insufficient evidence, and that
the sentence was then carried into effect
with indecent haste and inhumanity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is stated that there is still a prospect
that Mr. Jefferson Davis may be put on
trial for complicity in the assassination plot.
It is said that among the documents recent-
ly discovered are some which fasten upon
him most clearly the guilt of having abetted
the crime, and there is a rumour that he
will be tried by a military commission at
Washington.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The Moniteur has stated that "the re-
ports current that an understanding had
been arrived at between the great Powers
of Europe for the assembly of a Congress
are devoid of foundation."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Prince Imperial is offically stated to
have completely recovered from his in-
disposition, and the Empress and her son
have gone to Fontainebleau. A correspon-
dent, writing from the French capital, says
the illness of the boy has been caused by
the injudicious efforts to make him a prodigy
of learning. The Prince gave way under the
weight of the tasks.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Moniteur contradicts the statements
which have been published that the Emper-
or Napoleon intended to promote Abd-el-
Kader to a sort of vice royalty in Algeria.
The official journal says, "The rumour of
the appointment of Abd-el-Kader to any
post whatever in Algeria is destitute of
foundation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Paris press has taken a warm inter-
est in Mr. Gladstone's success in South
Lancashire. At first it was reported that he
had been defeated, and the news was receiv-
ed with deep regret. His rejection at Ox-
ford is looked upon in Paris as a decided
gain to the liberal cause. The Courier du
Dimanche thinks that the constituency
which regrets the Chancellor who brings
in his budget every year with a surplus,
and reduces taxation, must be hard to please.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Courier suggestively adds that it knows
of a country where such financial genius
would be welcome. The France is especial-
ly loud in its praises of Mr. Gladstone, and
congratulates the electors of South Lancas-
hire on "having had the privilege of return-
ing the glorious defeated of Oxford.{{< /news/text >}}

idents, sailed from New York July 1st, on
his return to Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We notice in the China Express of 27th
July the following statement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The King of Siam has resolved on the re-
organisation of his fleet, and has sent an
order to France for the construction of a
Corvette and four armed vessels of lighter
draft." We are authorised to state that there
is no truth whatever in this statement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are authorised to say that the Siam-
ese government has already taken the sub-
ject of copper coin into consideration, and
decided that it will not be wise to entertain
any proposition to import copper etc into
the country, but would encourage the ex-
pectation that importations of simple cop-
per can be readily sold to government at
reasonable prices.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We hear of much oppressive treatment
at the Custom Office of Bangsai on the riv-
er Chow Phya a little below Ayuthia of
country Chainaman, coming in boats from
northern Siam, loaded with merchandise
for this market. If the half we learn
be true, the matter claims prompt and thor-
ough investigation by government. In our
next Siamese issue we purpose to publish a
more full account of the complaints that come
from that quarter. It seems to us quite
probable that such violence is not limited
to that single Custom Office but will, on in-
vestigation, be found at many others.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We learn from the best authority, that
the prospects of the rice crops are now very
fair in almost all parts of the country. But
in the immediate vicinity of Bangkok they
are rather precarious for the want of rain.{{< /news/text >}}
