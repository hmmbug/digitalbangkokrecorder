Mr. John Stuart Mill M. P.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}THE learned late Master of Trinity, a
few days before his death, congratulated
the electors of Westminster on having
realized a suggestion of Plato's, that it
would be well for a country to give its
philosophers a place among its political
rulers. It is yet too soon for us to antici-
pate the part which Mr. John Stuart Mill
is likely to take in the practical debates of
Parliament, though his bill for the reor-
ganisation of local government in the me-
tropolis seems a valuable contribution to
the legislative stock. But his theoretical
opinions on nearly all the questions of es-
sential principle that underlie the contro-
versies of the present day are very clearly
defined. They have been published in
those consummate expositions of sound
thought and generous sentiment which
have helped to guide the counsels of the
most intellectual section of Reformers in
England during more than thirty years.
Of course, these views and the spirit in
which they were set forth are extremely
remote from those clamorous appeals to
vulgar passion, in the name of a spurious
and overbearing democracy, which were
rife until lately upon the platforms of rest-
less faction. Liberal and progressive in
the truest sense; full of a frank confidence
in the disposition of the great body of the
people; full of the purest zeal for the ele-
vation of mankind, the strongest faith in
the good results of individual and nation-
al freedom, his writings could never be
rooted by any orator who strove to stir up
the hatred of one class against another, or
be pretended to urge the claim of one
numbers to control the government of the
State. With what important reservations,
or what hopes of giving an equitable and
useful direction to the advanced Medical
party, Mr. Mill has now condescended to
leave the tranquil atmosphere of his lofty
studies and mingle in the actual fray, might
partly be gathered from his declarations
last year, when he was elected, and from
comparing these with his books. It is not
our purpose here to estimate the signifi-
cance of his presence in the new House
of Commons. He is welcomed there by
the wisest and most thoughtful men of all
parties—-Conservatives as well as Reform-
ers—-who cherish the intellectual reputa-
tion of that House, and trust that the
standard of argument in its discussions
may be improved by the example of one of
the greatest masters of the art of thinking.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His eminence in that capacity is recog-
nized by all the educated classes of his
countrymen. Some years ago, when a
meeting of the British Social Science As-
sociation had brought many strangers to
Oxford, a Frenchman, happening to talk
with a resident member of the University,
inquired about the state of philosophical
pursuits among us. “I see here,” he said,
“in your ancient colleges a richly-endow-
ed provision for that kind of scholar-ship
which consists of the study of the classi-
cal languages and literature ; I see, too, in
the movements of your scientific societies
and congresses a great deal of activity em-
ployed in the investigation of physical
phenomena, or in the collection and com-
parison of statistics relating to the practi-
cal interests of mankind. But have you
any philosopher of first-rate powers who
studies to verify and to account for the or-
iginal sources of human knowledge—who
strives to understand the process of belief
or who seeks to analyse the constitution of
the mind, to define its capacities and oper-
ations, and the conditions and the limits of
its acquaintance with the universe?” The
Englishman answered “Yes ; we have
John Stuart Mill. He is not only a politi-
cal thinker, who has defined the functions
of Government, and whose ‘Essay on Lib-
erty’ is as good, as your Rousseau’s ‘Con-
trat Social’ is bad ; for Mill concludes in
favour of the perfect freedom of the indi-
vidual, while Rousseau ends by establish-
ing the absolute power of the community
over each of its members. Mill is not on-
ly an economist who has treated—-with the
most refined scientific analysis, and in a
most comprehensive discussion—-of the
laws of the production and diffusion of
wealth, yet regarding them as subordinate
to the improvement of humanity. He is
not only a moralist, who has enlarged, el-
evated, and purified the meagre Utilitari-
anism of Bentham ; and, while vindicating
the ethical principle of the greatest hap-
piness, shown, how it may be reconciled
with the aspirations of heroic virtue and
devotion. He is also a mental philosopher,
allied most nearly to Locke, but one who
has arrived at the best results that are at-
tainable within the limits of that theory
which makes experience the source of all
our knowledge ; and on this ground he has
taken a position rivalling at least the chief
of the Scottish metaphysicians. He is, a-
bove all, the author of a complete system
of logic, exhibiting all the methods or pro-
cesses, both the syllogistic and the induc-
tive, which can be employed by the intel-
lect in the pursuit of truth ; he has laid
down rules for the investigation of facts,
and for drawing correct inferences from
their evidence, with a view to positive
science, as the lawyers have their own
rules of evidence to direct the trial of
cases in our courts ; and so far as the mor-
al science are concerned, he has, with as
much success as M. Comte in your country,
described their place and order in a gener-
al system of philosophy, and the respective
conditions of their study.”{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This being the intellectual reputation of
Mr. Mill, whose works are used as author-
ized text-books in the great English Uni-
versities, and who is held by his numerous
disciples to have superseded the famous
philosophical teaching of the University
of Edinburgh, there is one thing about his
personal history which seems to deserve
especial remark. His mind, one of the
most highly cultivated, as well as one of
the most original which the age can boast,
was never subjected to academical instruc-
tion in school or college. In his youth he
was taught at home by his eminent father,
and no education could have done so much
for him as to be the child and pupil of
such a man as James Mill, whose merits
and achievements are rather enhanced than
eclipsed by the more illustrious career of
his son. In the year 1773, at the time
when two other great thinkers of Scotland,
David Hume and Adam Smith, were shed-
ding clear light upon the most important
themes of mental and social philosophy,
James Mill was born, of humble parents, in
a village in Forfarshire. By the assistance
of a gentleman in the neighbourhood, Sir
John Stuart, whose liberality has since
been nobly recompensed through the glory
acquired by his namesake in our days,
James Mill received the benefits of learn-
ing. He commenced a literary career first
in Edinburgh, afterwards in London. He
turned his attention first to psychology, as
a follow of Hartley, founding all the con-
ceptions of the mind on mere combinations
of sensations ; secondly, to political econ-
omy, in which he followed Ricardo. He
produced books on each of those subjects,
the best that could then be written from
their own point of view. He then com-
posed a “History of British India,” a
work, not only of accurate research, but of
great narrative interest and philosophical
insight. An official appointment in the
India House relieved him from the toils
and cares of one who has to earn his bread
by his pen, and then gave him leisure to
form the mind of his son, born at Fenton-
ville, in the year 1806, whose career has
been in remarkable harmony with that of
the father.{{< /news/text >}}

The Queen's Speech.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
My Lords and Gentlemen,
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is with great satisfaction that I have
recourse to your assistance and advice.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have recently declared my consent
to a marriage between my daughter Prin-
cess Helena and Prince Christian of
Schleswig-Holstein Sonderburg-Augus-
tenburg. I trust this union may be pro-
perous and happy.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The death of my beloved uncle the
King of the Belgians has affected me with
profound grief. I feel great confidence,
however, that the wisdom which he evin-
ced during his reign will animate his suc-
cessor, and preserve for Belgium her in-
dependence and prosperity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}My relations with foreign Powers are
friendly and satisfactory, and I see no
cause to fear any disturbance of the ge-
neral peace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The meeting of the fleets of France
and England in the ports of the respec-
tive countries has tended to cement the
amity of the two nations, and to prove to
the world their friendly concert in the
promotion of peace.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have observed with satisfaction that
the United States, after terminating suc-
cessfully the severe struggle in which
they were so long engaged, are wisely re-
pairing the ravages of civil war. The
abolition of slavery is an event calling
forth the cordial sympathies and congra-
tulations of this country, which has al-
ways been foremost in showing its ab-
horrence of an institution repugnant to
every feeling of justice and humanity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have at the same time the satisfac-
tion to inform you that the exertions and
perseverance of my naval squadron have
reduced the slave trade on the West Coast
of Africa within very narrow limits.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A correspondence has taken place be-
tween my Government and that of the
United States with respect to injuries in-
flicted on American commerce by cruis-
ers under the Confederate flag. Copies
of this correspondence will be laid be-
fore you.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The renewal of diplomatic relations
with Brazil has given me much satisfac-
tion, and I acknowledge with pleasure
that the good offices of my ally, the King
of Portugal, have contributed essentially
to this happy result.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have to regret the interruption of
peace between Spain and Chili. The
good offices of my Government, in con-
junction with those of the Emperor of
the French, have been accepted by Spain,
and it is my earnest hope that the caus-
es of disagreement may be removed in
a manner honourable and satisfactory to
both countries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The negotiations which have been long
pending in Japan, and which have been
conducted with great ability by my Min-
ister in that country in conjunction with
the representatives of my allies in Japan,
have been brought to a conclusion which
merits my entire approbation. The exis-
ting treaties have been ratified by the
Mikado; it has been stipulated that the
tariff shall be revised in a manner favour-
able to commerce, and that the indemni-
ty due under the terms of the convention
of October, 1864, shall be punctually
discharged.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have concluded a treaty of commerce
with the Emperor of Austria, which I
trust will open to that empire the blessings
of extended commerce and be produc-
tive of important benefits to both coun-
tries.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The deplorable events which have oc-
curred in the island of Jamaica have in-
duced me to provide at once for an im-
partial inquiry, and for the due main-
tenance of authority during that inquiry,
by appointing a distinguished military
officer as Governor and Commander of
the Forces. I have given him the assis-
tance of two able and learned commission-
ers, who will aid him in examining into
the origin, nature, and circumstances of
the recent outbreak, and the measures
adopted in the course of its suppression.
The Legislature of Jamaica has propos-
ed that the present political Constitution
of the island should be replaced by a new
form of government. A bill upon this
subject will be submitted to your consid-
eration.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Papers on these occurrences will be
laid before you.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Papers on the present state of New
Zealand will be laid before you.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have given directions for the return
to this country of the greater portion of
my regular forces employed in that
colony.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I watch with interest the proceedings
which are still in progress in British
North America with a view to a closer
union among the provinces, and I contin-
ue to attach great importance to that
object.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have observed with great concern
the extensive prevalence, during the last
few months, of a virulent distemper
among cattle in Great Britain.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}with deep regret, and with sincere sym-
pathy for the sufferers, that I have learnt
the severe losses which it has caused in
many countries and districts. It is satis-
factory to know that Ireland and a consi-
derable part of Scotland are as yet free
from this calamity; and I trust that, by
the precautions suggested by experience,
and by the Divine blessing on the means
which are now being employed, its fur-
ther extension may be arrested.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The orders which have been made by
the Lords of my Privy Council, by vir-
tue of the powers vested in them by law,
with a view to prevent the spreading of
this disease, will be laid before you; and
your attention will be called to the expe-

interests of my people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}**GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS**{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have directed that the Estimates of

The Speeches of President
Johnson and Mr. Bancroft
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(DAILY NEWS.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The American custom of publicly cele-
brating the anniversaries of deceased
patriots has at no time been recommended
by the style of oratory which it has de-
veloped. Before the war it had greatly
contributed to form a habit of hollow and
turbid declamation, often in strange con-
trast with the simplicity and truthfulness
of the characters nominally honoured.
Last month witnessed two of these cele-
brations, severally dedicated to the me-
mory of Abraham Lincoln and George
Washington. The speaker at the first
was Mr. Bancroft, the historian, and at
the second President Johnson. Neither
can be charged with the coldness which
marked the “orations” of former days;
both were glowing with passion; but the
address of neither was of a kind to gladden
the hearts of true patriots, or inspire dis-
tant observers with respect. Mr. John-
son’s speech was full of the old Tennessee
spirit, with this important difference, that
instead of being directed against the
Southern dis-Unionists, it was pointed at
men, but for whose public spirit and con-
stancy under disappointment and misfor-
tune he would not now be President of
the United States. His denunciations,
however, were not altogether without
cause. The President was defending
himself against violent and unjust attacks.
He had been personally assailed with a
bitterness which has rarely been surpass-
ed on account of his reconstruction policy,
and since the promulgation of his veto on
the Freedmen’s Bureau Bill, has been de-
nounced in Congress itself as a rebel and
traitor, and as an “obstacle which must
be got rid of.” It is now [.....]
detractors with words of wrath. The
problem of reconstruction is a very dif-
ficult one; it may be that the policy
which the President is pursuing will not
succeed in winning back the South, and
yet it may be his duty to try it, and to
hope for its success. Nor will his pre-
sent opponents have any right to taunt
him with its eventual failure. The dif-
ference between the President's and the
Radicals' is, that his plan contemplates
the whole Southern population, while
they care only for the negroes; forget-
ting that if the black man is to prosper, it
must be by the prosperity of the whole
community, and that if he is to enjoy
freedom it must be through the reinvi-
goration of free institutions; and that no
legislation which should impair these
could permanently serve his interests.
We can discover no signs that the course
which the Radicals have followed has
had the effect of driving President John-
son into the hands of the old Copper-
head party, although it was well cal-
culated to have that effect upon a weak-
er man. The President has plainly and
repeatedly declared that for the present
the negro must and shall be protected at
the South by special legislative and ad-
ministrative measures, with the execution
of which he is ready to charge himself.
Two days after the date of his veto he
told General Howard that he interpreted
the act of Congress passed last session as
authorizing the continuance of the Freed-
men's Bureau for one year from the pro-
clamation of peace which he proposes
shortly to issue. And he has declared
himself ready to go further than this, and
to give his assent to a Bill extending
the powers and operation of the existing
Bureau for two years. It is, therefore,
most unjust to represent him as opposed
to measures necessary for the protection
of the freedmen, and we cannot wonder
at the indignation he expressed on
Washington's birthday. His speech was
provoked by personal attacks; it was ut-
tered in defence of the constitution; and,
unlike those to which it was a reply, it
contained no menaces. But for all this it
was a coarse exhibition, and altogether
unworthy of the high office of the speak-
er. In the very endeavour to be superior
to parties Mr. Johnson is becoming a
partisan.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Mr. Bancroft's address on President
Lincoln's birthday was of a wholly dif-
ferent character. It was the result of
study and preparation. The puerile
vanity of the sentiment and the inflation
of the style would be amusing if we could
forget how often the display of these
childish qualities has dangerously misled
the world by causing it to disbelieve in
that earnestness and strength of the na-
tional character which underlies so much
superficial folly. The insults offered to
this country were gratuitous and imper-
tinent. What qualifications for doing
honour to President Lincoln can be as-
cribed to one who makes the birthday of
the late President the occasion for an out-
pouring of vulgar abuse upon any body;
A viler tribute to the sad, kindly, re-
ticent, peace-loving Lincoln than this
"oration" it would be difficult to imagine.
And the insult was elaborated with the
knowledge that the representative of this
country would be present to hear it. We
wonder if Mr. Bancroft once asked him-
self what were the reasons which led
Sir Frederick Bruce to accept the invita-
tion to the House of Representatives.
Did he suppose that the Minister was at-
tracted by the magic of his genius, or
was simply obeying the summons of Mr.
Seward? We know why our Ambassador
went, and that he would not have done
justice to the sincere, though tardy, feel-
ings of the English people if he had not
been present. Mr. Lincoln was more
honored that day by the willing attendance
and the magnanimous indifference of the
British Ambassador than he was by the
high wrought "eloquence" of his own
countryman. In the eyes of Sir Freder-
ick Bruce the littleness of the living could
not diminish the greatness of the dead;
and, agreeing with him, none of us regret
that he attended the celebration of Mr.
Lincoln's birthday, even at the cost of
listening to an oration from Mr. Bancroft.
But Mr. Seward must take care that our
Minister shall not again be made the vic-
tim of confidence in American hospitality.
One accident of this kind is too many.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}We have this day been looking
meditatively on the picture of the Illus-
trious [....] Her most gracious Ma-
jesty, the Queen of England in
the Illustrated London News for the
10th of Feb. and reading in connec-
tion the editorial account of Her Ma-
jesty's opening Parliament in person
on Tuesday the 6th of Feb; and are
happy to find our feelings in lively
sympathy with true Englishmen in
their high regard and profound love
for their Queen, and their gladness in
seeing her again, after her long "bap-
tism of sorrow" coming out from her
seclusion, nobly determining to cheer
her great people by opening herself the
New Parliament according to the ri-
tual of their noble constitution.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And when we remember that this
day is Her Majesty's 47th birth day,
and that it will be commemorated with
great joy by the many millions of
Her Majesty's subjects in all parts of
the earth, we feel our hearts going out
in this direction also, and would be
happy to unite with Her Majesty's
subjects in this "end of the earth" in
extolling Her Majesty's extraordinary
virtues and craving from the Most
High the best of Heaven's blessings
upon her royal person, her royal fami-
ly, and her great kingdom. But as
no Englishmen has thought it suita-
ble to invite us to join him in an ap-
propriate festival for this great occa-
sion, we must content ourselves in do-
ing what we can in our humble posi-
tion as editor of THE BANGKOK RECOR-
DER, now a very diminutive thing, but to
be honored nevertheless for what it is
destined to become. Here then on this
little sheet, so full of promise of great
growth and power, we record our
heart-felt sentiment—a toast if you so
please to call it, but to be drank with
the best wine of heaven.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA—-
the most illustrious and lovely Queen
England has ever had—May her bap-
tism of sorrow be turned henceforth and
forever into a baptism of joy-—Her
illustrious children copy closely her
most excellent example and share her
future blissful reward—-Her noble
subjects, wide expanding as the globe
we inhabit, move onward and upward
in every great and good reform in fra-
ternal conjunction with their own true
American Cousins, until perfection of
human government shall be fully rea-
lized on both sides of the Atlantic,
and be copied by all the nations and
kingdoms of the world.{{< /news/text >}}

Our Buddhist Champion.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}As we have never logically answer-
ed our antagonist's objection to the
Bible on the Rainbow question, and
since he thinks we have not treated
him fairly in passing it by, we will
now endeavour to do it and him jus-
tice in regard to the matter. He thinks
the Bible account of the rainbow is
so void of scientific accuracy and truth,
that it is a disgrace to the Book, and
a standing evidence against the su-
perlative excellence we claim for it.
What we have to do then, at the pre-
sent time, is to prove that so far from
dishonoring the Bible, that account of
the rainbow positively honors it, and
carries within itself evidence that it is
befitting the infinite God who spoke it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The passage cited by our antago-
nist may be found in the IX chapter
of Genesis the 9th and 17th verses
inclusive. The gist of his criticism
seems to be, that the Bible makes so
much of a mere "occular illusion"
which is not in the cloud nor in fact
anywhere else, and represents God as
establishing that utter nothing as a to-
ken of his covenant with Noah and his
posterity that there shall "no more be
a flood to destroy the earth." He fan-
cies that the author of the Rollo series
has proved that "there is no rainbow
at all" and that hence a strong argu-
ment, can be brought against the Bi-
ble on this ground. Is it possible that
our antagonist has from reading the
Rollo series or by any other means
come to disbelieve the existence of the
rainbow? If so, what is there in all
the world of which his senses take
cognizance that he will not disbelieve
for the sake of building an argument
against the Bible? He is grossly mis-
taken in concluding that the author of
the Rollo series taught his pupils the
[................................]
[................................]
ted is saying to her pupils that "there
is no rainbow, at all" she could not
have meant that there is nothing real
in it; for in her explanations of it she
immediately tells them that "the co-
lors they saw came from drops of rain
between them and the gate." Now
colors are in no sense a non-entity.
Most certainly they are something,
though they cannot be grasped and
handled like most other things. It was
in this sense, doubtless, that Miss Mary
intended her remark about the rain-
bow. It is not a bow as children com-
monly think it to be, the ends of which
can be reached and precious jewels
and other riches found there; but a
mere etherial display of colors in the
form of a bow, produced by the reflec-
tion and refraction of sun-beams
from an infinity of rain drops in the
act of falling. That such is the cause
of the rainbow was known by philos-
ophers more than 200 years ago. But
in the providence of God it was re-
served for the wonderful genius of the
immortal Sir Isaac Newton to unravel
all its mysteries, and state clearly all
the laws or rules by which it is made.
So that now any ordinary scholar in
the schools of Christian lands may
quite well understand them. These
laws are usually treated of in philoso-
phical books under the general head
of Colors in natural objects.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The rainbow is correctly classed
with all objects or things of color. It
is as much a real existence as any
other thing of color which the eye be-
holds, for example leaves, flowers, and
light. Indeed it is light and nothing
but light, so reflected and refracted
from pure globules of rain as to form
the appearance of a bow. The colors
of every thing we see depend upon the
kind of rays which it reflects. A set-
tled law of all bodies that have color
is that "their colors are not proper-
ties inherent in the bodies themselves
by which they immediately effect our
sight, but are mere consequences of
that peculiar disposition of the parti-
cles of each body, by which it is ena-
bled more copiously to reflect the rays
of one particular color, and to trans-
mit, or stifle or, more properly to ab-
sorb, the others." The light of the
sun is the great source of all the seven
primary colors, in all the variety of
shades of color are made by variously
combining the primary ones. The
rainbow displays all the primary co-
lors in such relations to each other
that we may distinguish each from
the other, and see them all admirably
blending into one another. But most
objects of color reflect only a part of
the rays that strike them. Some are
so constituted as to reflect the violet
rays or the indigo or pale blue, some
the green, some the yellow, some the
red, and others two or more of the se-
ven colors so blended as to produce
a variety of colors. All the rays not
reflected are absorbed and lost in the
object itself.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A mirror reflects all the rays of the
sun which strike it at a certain angle,
and hence the dazzling splendor of the
reflection. When we stand before
the mirror, rays of light make a per-
fect picture of our persons on the
glass, and then that picture is brought
by reflected rays and perfectly copied
on the expanded nerve of vision in the
eye. By the art of photography the
picture made on the glass is fixed so
it may be seen there and copied
from it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A pure glass in the form of a globe
or a soap bubble will reflect but a part
of the rays that strike it, while the
most of them pass through it, and
others being refracted twice are brought
to the eye of the spectator in connec-
tion with the reflected rays, and hence
the soft rainbow colors that appear by
the experiment.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now rain drops are like glass globes
or soap bubbles in their power to re-
flect and refract rays of light. And be-
cause an infinite number of them are
concerned in the phenomenon as viewed
at a certain angle by the eye, the con-
sequence is the appearance, not of an
entire circle as that produced by soap
bubbles, but a segment of a circle
as we see in the rainbow. Now since
such is the nature of the rainbow will
our antagonist still insist that it is an
utter nothing? He might as well in-
sist that the pictures of objects mir-
rored forth by the mirror are nothing,
that photographic pictures are nothing,
that all colors are nothing, nay that
there is no such thing as light.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The laws by which the rainbow are
constituted were all originally made,
and are continually kept in operation
[.........] alone. And we affirm,
[................................]
made the rainbow for the express
purpose of having it a perpetual sign
between Him and mankind, that He
will never again destroy the earth by
a deluge of waters. We believe what
Moses wrote of the rainbow in the
book of Genesis, for there is every
evidence which an honest mind can
desire, to prove that he wrote the whole
of that Book under the infallible in-
spiration of the Holy Spirit of God.
No uninspired man could have given
such an account of the creation as he
gave. And that account has been fully
and wonderfully substantiated by the
science of mathematics, and geology, and
that too in spite of the mighty efforts
which a large majority of the learned
in these sciences have made to over-
throw it. In the account which Mo-
ses gives of the rainbow there is not
the least intimation given that the
celestial arch was ever seen before
the flood, but contrariwise every ap-
pearance necessary to lead the reader
to the conclusion, that it was then
first ushered into existence as a most
striking and magnificent sign of pro-
mise and hope for the comfort and as-
surance of Noah and all his posterity.
Though the laws by which it is made
may have existed from the begin-
ning of the creation, it does not
necessarily follow that all the condi-
tions essential to their producing a
rainbow existed before that day. It
is Jehovah alone who brings the drops
of falling rain into such relations to
the eyes of men as that they see the
arch. Our daily experience teaches
us that He does not do this every time
it rains, but prefers to have it appear
only occasionally with intervals some-
times of weeks and months even when
the rain falls frequently. If God thus
prevent its appearance now with such
long intervals, what man in his senses
will be so rash as to say it is folly to
think that he probably did it for the
longer period of 1600 years before
Noah's exodus from the Ark?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again, had the rainbow been a
phenomenon of occasional appearance
before that day, which Noah had seen
perhaps, a thousand times in his life of
600 years, it is difficult to perceive how
he could have been deeply impressed
by its appearance then as a sign be-
tween Jehovah and himself. And the
words by which God established it as a
sign would not seem to comfort with
such an interpretation of it. "I do set
my bow in the cloud and it shall be a
token of a covenant between me and
the earth." The idea seems to be that
it was a new thing under the sun, and
that God made it that day. "And it
shall come to pass" said Jehovah
"when I bring a cloud over the earth
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud."
Now had it been seen many times be-
fore, and had it become a common oc-
currence as now, where would be the
propriety of giving a promise that it
should appear in the cloud in the fu-
ture? for that would be an occurrence
of course as it always had been. But
if that were the first time the bow ap-
peared, then the promise of its con-
tinuance became peculiarly necessary
and comforting. And such, we may
add, would seem to be the natural im-
pression produced in the minds of all
unsophisticated readers of that narra-
tive, who have no theory to support
contrary to it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again, there is much reason for the
opinion of many of the most learned
geologists, philologists, and mathemati-
cians, among whom are La Place,
Cuvier and Humboldt, that during all
the period of 1600 years before the
flood there was no rain in any part of
the earth, that the temperature of all
the present zones of the globe was uni-
formly mild throughout the whole
year, and that consequently there was
nothing to disturb the universal equili-
brium, and that hence the usual cau-
ses of rain must have been wanting.
That such was the fact they think is
demonstrated by the remarkably even
distribution of fossil remains of plants
and animals in all parts of the earth
as well in the frozen as in the frigid
and temperate zones. Now this dis-
covery of science independent of what
Moses wrote of that time, and with no
intention of supporting Moses by it, is
now found to be in wonderful harmo-
ny with the few words he says about
rain in the antediluvian age. His
words are "The Lord had not caused
it to rain upon the earth, but there
went up a mist and watered the whole
face of the ground." Now if it be true
that there was no rain before the flood,
then it follows that there was no rain-
bows, and that splendid token of
[.....................] and every to
mankind was first made after the flood
and for that express purpose.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That there was a great change at
the time of the deluge, producing vi-
cissitudes of seasons with their usual
and natural accompaniments of winds
clouds and rain, seems to be clearly
intimated in the account which Moses
gave of it; for he represents Jehovah
as having promised Noah that "while
the earth remaineth seed time and
harvest, and cold and heat, and sum-
mer and winter and day and night
shall not cease." 'The temperature
of the earth having undergone' says
Lord Rosse, 'this great change, which
modern science has discovered, and
cold winds and clouds having suc-
ceeded that ardent and serene sky
which universally prevailed in the
antedeluvian age, man would natural-
ly feel great apprehensions at such a
change lest the earth might become
more and more refrigerated, and lest
the corn should gradually decay
and deprive him of every means of
supporting his existence; therefore,
to him at this awful epoch with this
encouraging assurance" that "seed
time and harvest and cold and heat,
and summer, and winter, and day and
night shall not cease" as long as the
earth remaineth. Here then, we again
see, the discoveries of science and the
words of the divine writer going as it
were hand in hand in the accounts which
they afford of the primitive era. Is
it then necessary once more to ask
the reader how it was possible for
Moses thus to have fashioned his his-
tory of such a period so as to render
it in so many particulars, conforms-
ble to the facts which science has re-
cently discovered, if what he wrote was
a mere invention of his own fancy?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The truth is Moses wrote as the
Almighty and all-wise maker of the
universe by His Spirit dictate! to him,
and hence no discoveries of science
has ever detected the least error in
his writings; and we may rest assured
that they never can. And hence his
account of the rainbow is an accurate
account, and worthy of the all-wise
God who taught him what to write.
What though the rainbow be not
strictly in the cloud, but between the
observer and the cloud? Does it not
always appear to be in the cloud in
the same sense that the sun always
appears to rise and set? Is it not pro-
per for God to use such popular lan-
guage in speaking to men? Do not
the most scientifical and learned men,
in speaking of the rising and setting
of the sun and of the rainbow use
words adapted to the appearance and
not in strict accord with science?
Does not even our learned antagonist
always do so in speaking to his chil-
dren and to all others? Why then
should he ridicule the Word of God
because it is written in popular lan-
guage, speaking of the physical world
according as it naturally appears to
men and not as a treatise on science
would speak of them? Has he not yet
learned that the Bible was written
solely for the purpose of teaching true
and undefiled religion, that is, the knowl-
edge and service and enjoyment of
the true God? Has he yet to learn
that this knowledge is a light to the
soul far more important for the welfare
of mankind than the natural sun?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In concluding this long article we
beg to ask His Siamese Majesty if we
have not now been faithful in meeting
his objection and made it sufficiently
clear that the rainbow is a magnifi-
cent and most befitting sign, which
Jehovah made for the express pur-
pose of being a perpetual token of his
covenant with Noah and all his pos-
terity? Could there have been any
other more suitable and more worthy
of a God of love, and of a conspicuous
place as such in the Book of his love?{{< /news/text >}}

A Horrible Scene.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}While spending a few days in the
charming city of Petchaburee a little
more than a year since we were invited
to attend the cremation of the body of a
man in the medium walks of life. He
had been a near neighbor to the friends
with whom we were stopping, and had
died two or three days before. We
had never witnessed a like scene of
horror in this heathen country, al-
though we had been residents in it
more than thirty years. We had
heard of its being a common occurrence
in the country, but had not dreamed
of the half of its horrors. It seemed to
us quite strange that our eyes should
first behold it in the precincts of His
Majesty's lovely mountain palace, and
in a town above all others by nature
powerfully inviting to all lovely deeds.
In this are verified the words of Bishop
Heber.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}"Though every prospect pleases

{{< news/indent1 >}}And only man is vile"

{{< news/text >}}The corpse was first to be offered to
a flock of vultures—-a hundred or
more. Before the coffin was opened
the filthy and horrible gang had assem-
bled, "for where soever the the carcass
is there will the eagles ( vultures ) be
gathered together"—-They were perch-
ed on the ridges of the temple build-
ings, and even on small trees and bush-
es, within a dozen feet of the body.
They were so exceedingly hungry for
their morning meal that the sexton and
his assistants had to beat them off many
times from improper interference with
the various preliminary services that
must be had ere the coffin could be open-
ed. And when in the act of opening it,
the vultures, seeming to be aware that
there would be but a mouthful for each,
and very doubtful at that, if divided
among them all and a herd of greedy
dogs besides that were waiting for their
opportunity—-they swooped down in
great excitement to have the first bite.
It required many assistants to scare
them off until all was ready. The body
was taken out of the coffin and laid on
a little pile of wood that had been ar-
ranged on a small temporary altar
erected for the purpose. Being thus
made ready the birds were allowed to
descend upon the corpse and tear from
it as they liked. It was for a few
moments quite hidden by their rush
upon it. But it required only a mo-
ment for each bird, when once the way
was open for him, to grab up his part
with both bill and talons, when he
would spread his wings and mount up
to some quiet place for eating it. The
sexton seemed to consider that he too
was making merit by cutting off parts
of the body and throwing them to the
emaciated dogs round about the altar,
as the departed spirit of the dead man
had done in bequeathing his body to
vultures and dogs. The birds, not
satisfied with what they could get from
the altar, came down and quarrelled
with the dogs for a little of their share.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}While this was going on for the
space of about fifteen minutes, the
mourners stood, waiting with wax
candles and incense sticks in hand to
pay their last tribute of respect to the
deceased by assisting in the burning
of the bones that were left after the
vultures and the dogs had made them
bare as they could. The sexton with
the assistance of another man then
gathered up the skeleton and put it back
into the coffin. This was then taken
up by four men and carried around the
funeral pile three times. It was then
laid on the top of the wood, and a few
sticks of wood were put into the coffin
to aid in burning the bones. Then a
lighted torch was applied to the wood.
Next the relatives and other mourners
stepped up and laid each a wax candle
by the torch. Others brought incense
sticks and laid them on the pile. Hav-
ing thus performed their last tribute
of respect for the dead, the friends re-
tired from the scene.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The vultures, having had but a scanty
breakfast, lingered around the place
until they were sure the fire would
leave nothing more for them, when they
shook their hideous heads, and hop-
ping a few steps to get up a little mo-
mentum, as they always do, flapped
their shaggy wings and flew away.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Vultures are certainly the most odi-
ous birds that were ever made. They
are always of a dirty carrion complex-
ion, and their heads always bald and of a
dirty white, excepting a few of their
leaders whose heads are red like a male
turkey. Their necks are but scantily
fledged with a down that was in-
tended to be white, but is always
odiously dirty. They are all of a purple
putrid color, and apparently equal in
size, being about that of a common
hen turkey.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A bird which lives upon dead bodies
as the vultures do is of course looked
upon by the heathen with many slavish
and fearful superstitions. They are
regarded as the bearers of death war-
rants to some one or more of the family
occupying the house on which they
alight. These warrants can be avert-
ed only by offerings of incense sticks,
flowers and parched rice, and these
while thought oftentimes efficacious
are known to fall about as frequently.
Hence the advent of vultures to the
ridge of one's house is always regarded
as a sad event.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is accounted a very great sin to kill
vultures. And the reason is, that they
themselves never kill animals and are
so strict in carrying out their determina-
tion not to do so, as to prefer to live
always on putrid meat. They afford
an illustrious example of Budd[h]'s pre-
cept never to kill animals of any kind.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We had supposed that such a dis-
position of dead human bodies was re-
served only for the greatest criminals.
But we learned then that many of the
country people, even of the most re-
spectable classes make an offering of
the bodies of their dead to the vultures
under the superstitious notion that they
make peculiar merit by the act, both
in behalf of the departed spirit of the
dead and of themselves. Some persons,
knowing that they are soon to die, give
orders that their flesh be given to the
vultures, hoping by it to gain some
merit in a future state. O that this
deluded people might know and choose
the true way to obtain merit, and a
happy and glorious eternity!{{< /news/text >}}

CRICKET FIGHTING.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Whilst walking through the bazaar
the other day a peculiar grating sound
constantly met my ears which seemed
familiar to me, but still I could not
think of the cause. Upon looking a-
round, however, I was reminded that
it is the Cricket-season. Not that
athletic and useful-game which is so
much practiced in England and Ame-
rica, but the season for fighting crick-
ets. Such is the propensity of this
people for gaming, that they often-
times descend as low as it is possible to
get. It might be supposed that cock
fighting was about as low as it is pos-
sible to get in that line, but the Siam-
ese descend still lower than that,
and fight birds and crickets. After
the rains commence a small black
cricket (I think the grygllus hemip-
tera) becomes very pleaty. The boys
search for these little creatures, by
tearing up the old brick walks and
digging in the loose ground. They
make a small box of tough mud plac-
ing wooden bars in the upperside so
that the crickets can be put in, and
taken out at pleasure. These boxes,
each one containing a cricket, are ex-
posed for sale, at many of the stalls in
the market. When they wish to have
a fight two strangers are put together
in the same box, and the little fellows
pitch into each other with wonderful
pluck. Considerable sums of money are
often staked on favorite crickets. The
sport, too, is not confined to boys but it is
said that even noblemen engage in it.
There is scarcely any thing more in-
jurious to Siam to-day than this unusual
disposition to sport by all classes. In-
deed there is no more useless class of
society the world over than sporting
gentlemen. That class of persons so
numerous in Europe and America
usually denominated turfites are only
carrying out this same disposition on
a larger scale. {{< news/indent4 >}} SCRIBBLER.{{< /news/text >}}

THE RED LIME WORKS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among the customs of the Siamese,
and also of some other Oriental na-
tions, there is scarcely any thing more
disgusting to the eyes of a European,
than the chewing of the areca nut,
in connection with the seri leaf, lime,
tobacco &c. A red saliva is continu-
ally oozing from their mouths, which
contaminates almost every thing with
which they come in contact. I have
seen women cooking rice, and prepar-
ing victuals for the family, with their
fingers all daubed with the red saliva.
Occasionally too, they would stop in
the midst of their work, and put their
fingers into their mouth, in order to
give the quid a peculiar turn. I heard
an officer in the English navy remark
not long since, that he considered some
of the Siamese women rather pretty,
at first sight, but when he came to
look at their mouth it all vanished, and
they became disgusting to him. This
practice is almost universal here, by
all classes and by both sexes. When
asked why they do it, the almost uni-
versal answer is, that it is to prevent
the mouth, and teeth from giving out
an offensive smell. Of course it does
kill any offensive smell coming from
the breath or teeth, but the cure is
more offensive than the disease.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The preparation of the lime for this
purpose, like almost every thing else in
Siam is of course a monopoly. The
work, however, except the burning of
the lime, is done principally by Pe-
guan women. The establishment is
on the bank of the river above the
city, adjoining the Rong Lao, dis-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}tillery. The lime stones are brought
from a distance, principally from the
Meklong, and are burned in a primitive
kiln, not unlike those formerly used
in western countries. Near the kiln
are a number of round vats, built with
brick and mortar, and resembling one
half of a hogshead, which has been cut
in two. These vats are built adjoining
each other. Occasionally by the side
of one of the larger vats, is one very
much smaller, but of similiar shape.
In a place adjoining the vats a num-
ber of women may be found pound-
ing the turmeric root, in a kind of
mortar, and working the hammers
with their feet. They then take some
of the pulverized turmeric root, and
put it into the small vat adjoining the
larger ones, and pour some water over
it. They then take a basket of un-
slaked lime, and put it in also, and by
the time the lime is slaked, the mix-
ture has assumed a beautiful crimson
colour. The mixture is then taken
out of the small vat, and strained
through a cloth into one of the larger
ones, and it is then passed from one
to the other, by means of bamboo
spouts. After it has dried down to a
proper thickness, it is peddled out by
women in boats, together with other
articles for sale, and sometimes the
boat has nothing but the lime itself.
Quantities of it are sent off in boats,
and small junks down the coast, and
to other places throughout the king-
dom. A very small quantity of it
spread on the seri leaf, is sufficient to

bacco &c. a proper colour and tone.
A quantity of it together in the vats,
presents a very pretty appearance and
reminds one of ice cream coloured

Birth.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}At her residence in this city on the
18th inst. Mrs. Bateman, wife of S.
Bateman Esqr. Secretary to His Ex-
cellency the Prime Minister, of a son.{{< /news/text >}}

Death.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}At his residence in this city, on the
9th inst. Phya P'et-pance of a chronic
disease from which he had suffered
nearly six months. The cremation of
his body took place at Temple Sa-
kate on Monday the 21st inst.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}Deceased was one of the Siamese
judges connected with the foreign de-
partment, and has been reported to us
for publication in the "Siamese Re-
corder" as a blameless man in his offi-
cial capacity.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}We are very sorry to hear that
Phya Montree Sôôriwang the younger
own brother of His Excellency Chow
Phya Kralahôme the Prime Minister is
dangerously sick of acute dysentery.
He has been ill several weeks, and till
quite recently, entirely under the me-
dical care of native physicians. Being
by them pronounced incurable, he has
placed himself in the hands of Doctor
Campbell R. N. We greatly fear it is
too late for any human skill to effect
a cure. The patient, it will be re-
membered, was at the head of the Si-
amese Embassy to London in 1857.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is still a time of great quietness
in all the outward manifestation of
this people. There is but little stir in
any department of business. There
are three steam rice mills running
much the greater part of the time.
The 4th mill, we think, is not yet quite
ready to begin operations. We are
informed that rice producers are be-
coming more and more inclined to sell
their paddy for hulling at these mills
rather than hull it themselves by the
tedious native process. There is every
prospect that steam rice mills will, not
long hence, drive the native mills into
oblivion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Steam saw mills are more slow in
getting into power here; but they are
surely making progress, and will, with-
out doubt, ere long annihilate the pre-
sent plan of sawing wholly by the
strength of human muscles unaided by
the least machinery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are now in port only 10 for-
eign vessels to compete with 54 fine
square rigged brigs, barques, and
ships. But it is reported that many of
the Siamese and Chinese owners of
these vessels, are beginning to think
that they have quite over done their
business in that line, and that it would
have been more profitable for them to
have bought a less number of foreign
vessels and relied more on chartering
from foreigners, as the losses by wear,
tear and wreck, and dishonest servants
and agents often consumes all the profit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is interesting to contrast the pre-
sent state of shipping in port with
what was the usual appearance this
season of the year on the river, and
at the anchorage over the bar 30 years
ago. Then there were two lines of
monstrous Junks engaged in the
China trade at anchor in the river
numbering from 60 to 80. Now there
are not more than 3 or 4, and these
are so far behind the times as to be-
come curiosities. There are from 80
to 100 small native junks used as
lighters and for country trading. Besid-
es these there are a few of a little larger
size which trade between this and
Hainan. The large China Junks al-
ways left sometime in June and re-
turned in January or February taking
all possible advantage of the monsoons.{{< /news/text >}}

A Sponge and what it is.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The very sponge which washes your face
was brought up from the bottom of the
ocean, and was part of a living animal.
For a long time sponges were supposed to
be plants—-Messrs. Agassiz and Gould, in
1848, called them so; but later observation
has decided them to be animals; and they
are placed in the class Protozoa, the class
most resembling plants.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When first found in the water, their ap-
pearance is very different from this which
you now see. This is the skeleton only, the
part corresponding to our bones. When this
was a complete living thing, deep down
under the ocean, it was covered all over the
outside, and filled in every one of those lit-
tle holes with a soft substance, something
like the white of an egg, and this was like
our flesh. It was fastened tightly to a rock;
and its color was a dull bluish black on the
upper side, and a dirty white below. It was
formerly supposed to be a plant, because it
was always fast in one place; but, for
other reasons, it is decidedly an animal.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}All through this mass is a regular circu-
lation like our blood and food. It has been
seen to absorb nutritious matter-—that is,
to eat, or rather to drink. You see all over
its surface, orifices or holes: these commu-
nicate with each other all throughout. In-
to the largest of these, called pores, the sea-
water is constantly entering, and out thro-
ugh the small ones, called vents, it is re-
gularly spouted out; and it doubtless
finds in this sea-water minute animals
which serve it for food, and increase its
bulk. And this odd creature produces
others like itself.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From the soft part a little globule is seen
to float off—and, after moving about for a
while very briskly, here and there, as if
looking for a place, it fastens itself to some
rock. Next, gradually, begins to be seen
the more solid skeleton, the soft part grows
more bulky, and thus it grows; not very
slowly, either, for the divers find it, at the
end of three years, large enough to carry
away.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To get these sponges from the bottom of
the ocean, furnishes occupation for a great
number of people. One thousand men are
busy in the Ottoman archipelago alone—-
and thousands, besides, with many hun-
dred boats, are engaged in the Gulf of Mac-
hri, on the Barbary coast and elsewhere;
so that in many villages, from May till Sep-
tember, the best diving time, only old men,
women, and children can be found.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The finest kind is brought from the
Ægean Sea. At daylight there, in the sum-
mer time, when the weather is pleasant
(for it requires smooth water), the boats,
each with six or eight men and one pair of
oars, will leave the shore, and proceed to
where the water is eight, or ten, or even
thirty fathoms deep—-for those found in
shallow water are very inferior.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Here they stop, and the divers prepare
to descend. Each one puts a hoop around
his neck, and to this fastens a bag in which
the sponges are put as they are gathered.
In very deep water the diver uses a rope,
with a heavy stone to it. He sinks the stone
to the spot he intends to reach, and thus
it holds the rope steadily, which he uses to
assist himself in coming up again to the
surface.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After being busy thus till noon, they re-
turn to some of those pleasant little nooks,
which abound on the shores of the archi-
pelago, to prepare what they have gathered
fit for sale.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The first thing is to press on the soft
part of the animal, and then to bleach the
remainder in the sun; so they beat them,
and stamp on them, and trample them,
till there is no more life left. The skele-
ton part is then washed and spread in the
sun, until it is quite clean, and grown to
be this dull yellowish color; then it is
packed in bags and sent to market for
sale—-sent in all parts of Asia, Europe,
and America, and used for washing pur-
poses.—The PACIFIC{{< /news/text >}}

Not a "Developed"
Angle Worm.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dr. Stein, a German professor, has
recently summed up the progress and
attainment of knowledge of the "infusorial
animals," or the lowest forms of animal
life, such as are seen in the liquids by
the help of a microscope. The conclu-
sions are adverse to the theory of Darwin
of the creation of animal life from veg-
itable matter, and its steady growth or
development upward to the highest forms
or existence, even to man. Dr. Stein
says all infusoria are supplied with special
inner propagating organs, that it is in-
credible that they are created in any other
way, that they are only brought forth in
like forms of the same species, that un-
der no circumstances are they developed
from inert matter, and that no human
experiment ever has or ever can produce
the simplest living atom. How the first
forms of each species are brought into
being is a secret that no science has yet
solved, and probably never can; but it
is proved that all life comes from life,
and it must be content with that achieve-
ment. Dr. Stein reconciles his conclusions
with the frequent phenomenon that small
animal life appears among vegitable mat-
ter put in water, and even in apparently
pure rain water itself, by stating that it
has been discovered that the infusorial
animals have the capacity of changing
into a passive state, and shrinking and
hardening into petty capsules, like in-
finitesimal bits of vegetable matter, and
in this form are attached to grass, earth,
or other substances, and go along with them
into water, or are washed into it, and be-
ing therein are re-vivified, and multiply.
Another peculiarity of these simple forms
of animal life is, that some, if not all of
them, are multiplied by dividing them-
selves in two. Under the protection of
these antagonistic conclusions to the Dar-
winian theory, man may hold himself in
new self-respect, as a distinct, original
creation—-"in the very image of God"
—-and not a "reconstructed," overgrown
bit of decayed grass—a step from the
monkey, and only a pair of stairs above
an angle-worm.—-SPRINGFIELD REPUB-

Gov. Brownlow on
REPRESENTATION.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Gov. Brownlow writes to Schuyler Col-
fax urging the admission to Congress of
the members-elect from Tennessee, but he
adds the following striking statement:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"If the removal of the federal troops
from Tennessee must necessarily follow
upon the admission of our Congressional
delegation to their seats, why then, and in
that case, the loyal men of Tennessee hay
to be without representatives in Congress.
But our members can be admitted, and a
military force retained sufficient to govern
and control the rebellious. I tell you, and
through you all whom it may concern, that
without a law to disfranchise rebels, and a
force to carry out the provisions of that
law, this state will pass into the hands of
the rebels, and a terrible state of affairs is
bound to follow. Union men will be driven
from the state, forced to sacrifice what they
have, and seek homes elsewhere. And yet
Tennessee is in a much better condition
than any of the other revolted states, and
affords a stronger loyal population."{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}GOOD FOR KENTUCKY.—In the House,
on Friday, Mr. McKee, of Kentucky, made
a brave speech in favor of the Constitu-
tional Amendment introduced by the joint
committee on reconstruction, in which he
said:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Those who were in favor amending
the Constitution were met by those gentle-
men with the cry of usurpation, because
Representatives from the rebellious states
were not admitted to the floor. But why
sent the Southern Representatives from
this hall? They departed of their own ac-
cord, going out one by one, and state by
state. They picked up their hats and walk-
ed out in disgust. They wanted no part
in the legislation of the nation, and said
they would never come back again. He
thanked God they were not now here. They
had no right to be heard. He did not de-
sire to see the day when a traitor could
ask to come back and have the same rights
as those who upheld our banner in the
field. The pending amendment did not go
so far as he desired. He would like, for
one, to say that no man who had raised his
hand against the state should ever partici-
pate in our legislation. The reason the
South were not allowed Representatives
was that the people had not shown a loyal
spirit, such as would justify their admis-
sion. They elect men more odious, while
the latter ask for admission with their
hands rocking with the blood of loyalists.
Let them send men here, who during the
war, have stood by the country, elect men
who never went into treason, and reject
the odious traitors. Never, so help him
God, until then would he admit them."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are some Northern Representa-
tives in Congress whose claims upon the
respect and confidence of their true-heart-
ed constituents would be augmented if they
could find courage to act and talk like this

Why They Didn't go to
Church
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}A curious man who keeps a note of all
he hears, has given to the public six
months of excuses for not attending
church. They are as follows:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Overslept myself ; could not dress in
time ; too cold ; too hot ; too windy ; too
dusty ; too wet ; too damp ; too sunny ;
too cloudy ; don't feel disposed ; no time
to myself ; look over my drawer ; put my
papers to right ; letters to write to friends ;
mean to take a walk ; going to take a
ride ; tied to business six days a week ;
no fresh air but on Sunday can't breathe
in church ; always so dull ; feel a little
feverish ; feel a little chilly ; feel a little
sleepy ; feel a little lazy ; expect company
to dinner ; got a headache ; intend nurs-
ing my self to-day ; new bonnet not
come home ; tore my muslin dress down
stairs ; got a new novel, must be returned
on Monday morning ; wasn't shaved in
time ; don't like the liturgy, always pray-
ing for the same thing ; don't like the
extempore prayer ; don't like an organ,
'tis too noisy ; don't like the singing with-
out music, makes me nervous ; the spirit
is willing but the flesh is weak ; dislike
an extemporary sermon, it is too frothy ;
can't bear a written sermon, it is too pro-
sy ; nobody to-day but our own preacher,
can't always listen to the same ministers ;
don't like strangers ; can't keep awake
while at church, fell asleep last time I
was there, shan't risk it again.{{< /news/text >}}

Powers of a Bird's Song.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}When we hear the song of the soaring
lark, we may be sure that the entire at-
mosphere between us and the bird is filled
with pulses, or undulations, or waves, as
they are often called, produced by the
little songster's organ of voice. This or-
gan is a vibrating instrument, resembling
in principle the clarionet. Let us suppose
that we hear the song of a lark, elevated
to the hight of five hundred feet in the
air. Before this is possible, the bird must
have agitated a sphere of air one thou-
sand feet in diameter—-that is to say, it
must have communicated to seventeen
thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight
tons of air, a motion sufficiently intense
to be appreciated by our organ of hearing.

Jamaica Riot.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In our last, under the above head,
we gave an account of the execution
of Mr. George H. Gordon. The Bri-
tish Standard, of Dec. 8th, says : Mr.
Gordon was clearly a man of no com-
mon character. His piety was not
only decided, but ardent, and his
Christain charity was comprehensive
of every section of the Church of God.
His origin and history greatly intensi-
ty the interest of the subject.{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< news/indent1 >}}*{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The excellent Dr. King, of London,
who made a lengthened sojourn in Ja-
maica, was well acquainted with him,
and has borne a noble testimony to
his intelligence and his worth.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Dr. King says, he was a member of
the United Presbyterian Church in
Kingston, and that every one, from
the highest to the lowest, spoke of
him with esteem. He says:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}“Mr. Gordon was the son of a white
gentleman, one of the custodies of the
island, much esteemed for his dignified,
hospitable, and obliging deportment.
Like many in elevated position and of
refined manners, he had children by his
slaves—born to slavery as their heritage.
This was the birthright of poor George
Gordon. Being a very smart boy he
taught himself with very little aid to
read, write, and cast accounts. By his
diligence and intelligence he continued
to gather money, with which he bought
his freedom. Once free himself, he gain-
ed enough to emancipate his sisters, and
afterwards sent them to Europe for their
education—-first, I think, to London, and
then to Paris. Through the reverses of
the colony, the father from being very
rich came to lose all, and the colored son
bought his estate—-not, however, to de-
prive him of it, but to leave him in oc-
cupancy, surrounded by the comforts he
had been accustomed to enjoy. So acted
the son of the bondwoman when the feel-
ings of his father's white wife and her
children would not allow him to enter
the paternal abode. Yet he always spoke
to me with deferential regard for his fa-
ther; and never uttered a disrespectful
word regarding Mrs. Gordon. He was
tenderly sensitive. One day as we were
walking together, he became pensive and
absorbed, and, after ceasing for a little
to speak or listen, he requested me to
step aside with him. He stopped before
a slight elevation of the grass, and said
to me, with much emotion, 'My mother
is buried there; she was a negro and a
slave, but she was a kind mother to me,
and I loved her dearly.' As he uttered
these words his tears trickled down upon
her grave.”
(*) What, in this age of the Christian era to
say of a man in an elevated position having
children by women in no sense his wives
that he is of refined manners! Why, it is a hor-
rible pervertion of language! Christ and his
gospel pronounces such mere adventurers. Such
refinement is but repugnant to abomination.){{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}The following letter from Mr, Gor-
don to his wife, will be read with
deep interest. One can hardly read
the accounts given in the English pa-
pers, of this outrageous action of the
Jamaica Governor, without seeing
that the spirit of hate engendered by
slavery in the oppressor towards the
oppressed, lies at the foundation of
these horrid barbarities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"My BELOVED WIFE—-General Nel-
son has just been kind enough to inform
me that the court-martial on Saturday
last has ordered me to be hung, and that
the sentence is to be executed in an hour
hence; so that I shall be gone from this
world of sin and sorrow.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I regret that my worldly affairs are
so deranged; but now it cannot be help-
ed. I do not deserve this sentence, for
I never advised or took part in any in-
surrection. All I ever did was to re-
commend the people who complained to
seek redress in a legitimate way; and if
in this I erred, or have been misrepre-
sented, I do not think I deserve the ex-
treme sentence. It is, however, the will
of my Heavenly Father that I should
thus suffer, in obeying His command to
relieve the poor and needy, and to pro-
tect, so far as I was able, the oppressed.
And glory be to His name; and I thank
Him that I suffer in such a cause. Glory
be to God, the Father of our Lord Je-
sus Christ; and I can say it is a great
honor thus to suffer, for the servant can-
not be greater than his Lord. I can now
say with Paul, the aged. "The hour of
my departure is come, and I am ready to
be offered up. I have fought a good
fight, I have kept the faith, and hence
forth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the right-
eous Judge, shall give me." Say to all
friends, an affectionate farewell; and
that they must not grieve for me, for I
die innocently. Assure Mr. Airy and
all others of the truth of this. Comfort
your heart. I certainly little expected
this. You must do the best you can,
and the Lord will help you; and do not
be ashamed of the death your poor hus-
band will have suffered. The judges
seemed against me; and, from the rigid
manner of the court, I could not get in
all the explanation I intended. The man
Anderson made an unfounded statement,
and so did Gordon; but his testimony
was different from the deposition. The
judges took the former and erased the
latter. It seems that I was to be sacrifi-
ced. I know nothing of the man Bogle.
I never advised him to the act or acts
which have brought me to this end.
Please write to Mr. Chamerovzow, Lord
Brougham, and Messrs. Hencknell and
Du Buisson."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"I did not expect, not being a rebel,
that I should have been tried and dis-
posed of in this way. I thought His Ex-
cellency the Governor would have allow-
ed me a fair trial, if any charge of sedi-
tion or inflammatory language were fair-
ly attributable to me; but I have no
power of control. May the Lord be
merciful to him."—-AN. MISSIONARY.{{< /news/text >}}
