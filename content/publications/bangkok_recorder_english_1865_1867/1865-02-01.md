Bangkok February 1st
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The resume of a fortnight in such
a place as this affords but little
that is startling. We Europeans
here are a small community by
ourselves, isolated as it were from
the "rest of mankind"; and to create
our own items of news beyond
what goes the the round of the
daily gossip, and the regular rou-
tine of business affairs is rather a
difficult undertaking. The rice
famine does not come single hand-
ed, for in consequence of it, we
are likely to have a dearth of news
also. The Chow Phya, the source
of our usual semi-monthly mail,
has for a time at least been turned
from her usual course. Many of
us did not receive our full mail up-
on the lost arrival of the steamer,
and now this another detention
will make it, as topers say "long
between drams".{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One little item of news however
has been received in a private way,
which to those of us who are thor-
oughly American, will compen-
sate in a great degree for the
absence of much other useful in-
formation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Along the wires of the Pacific
telegraph, that great artery which
connects Callifornia with her liv-
ing head and her sisters upon the
Atlantic, flashed this interesting
piece of information: "Abram
Lincoln is re-elected President of the
United States". That news made
its way thence to China, and
thence to Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The North has thus shown to
the world that she is not so nearly
exhausted as was supposed, and
that after a four year’s fearful
contest she is not yet willing to
make concessions to rebels and
slavery.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}To give up the struggle at this
stage of affairs would simply have
been to murder uselessly at least
one hundred thousand brave men.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The rebels have been hoping
much from the Presidential cam-
paign, and their sympathisers in
the North. Those hopes are now
frustrated. They have their last
man under arms. We may yet
expect to hear of one or two more
bloody actions,—the last convul-
sive throes,—the desperation strug-
gle of a dying monster, and then
the great rebellion will be among
the things that were.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But has this great city no news?
With its hundreds of thousands of
inhabitants, and babel tongues, has
it nothing worth recording? There
are doubtless many things which
are highly interesting to the na-
tives themselves but would not
be so to the majority of European
readers.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The most important event is the
return of His Majesty the Supreme
King and the royal retinue from a
visit to Petchaburee. The Court
has really been "out of town" en-
joying for a time the bracing air
of the Mountain Palace; where with
appropriate ceremonies the top-knot
of two of the royal offspring was
removed. This in the estimation
of many of this people, forms an im-
portant epoch in their history.
How much importance royalty
may attach to it we know not. Per-
haps like some other things it
may be made out a mere custom,
—a custom however as immutable
as the laws of the "Medes and Per-
sians". It is well known that the
common people attach much im-
portance to it. The general opinion
is, that if it is neglected, it will
prove disastrous to the child result-
ing in early death.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Before leaving Petchaburee, the
Royal party were amusing them-
selves in sending up balloons,
which had likely to prove disas-
trous lo the Palace itself. One of
the balloons descended upon the
attap roof of one of the out build-
ings connected with the Palace
and set it on fire, which resulted
in the destruction of a considerable
amount of property.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Among the happy family of Eu-
ropeans here, we expected, at one
lime during the past fortnight to
be under the necessity of record-
ing some trouble. The usually
clear horizon portended a storm.
The trumpet was sounded and the
assembly called. Reporters too
were there with pencil and paper
in hand ready to give to the world
the results of the deliberations.
There was however a difference of
opinion in the assembly. Some
saw danger nigh, but others were
incredulous. Some spoke warmly
and eloquently. No result how-
ever was reached, and the cloud,
in the mean time, passed away,
and the horizon was again clear.
The powers that be, are still in the
exercise of their usual functions.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rumour however says that the
real object of the assembly was not
broached; as to the truth of this
we know not. There are few fam-
ilies so well regulated that domes-
tic differences and difficulties will
not sometimes arise, but when
those have passed off, and full re-
conciliation has been made, the
less the world knows about the
nature of the difficulty the better.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}No one can help but know, that
we have, for the last week, been in
the midst of the Chinese holilays.
In this latitude, where we have
no shooting boys in the streets, full
show cases nor low mercury to
remind us, many of us can pass
our own holidays almost uncon-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}sciously. The natives however will
not let us pass theirs so.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Those of us who have any Celes-
tials in our employ find our domes-
tic arrangements somewhat inter-
fered with. True we have been
surfeited with pork, and sweet
meats, and our ears deafened with
the sound of firecrackers, and the
thrilling notes of the gong, but
what are all these when we come
home to dinner and find the cook
away on a "spree".{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is wonderful the power of
custom upon these Orientals. Many
of the Chinese here, never again
expect to set foot upon the soil of
their own Celestial empire, and
one would suppose that a day or
two of frolic would satisfy them;
but nothing short of the whole will
suffice. The Siamese-Chinese, many
of whom can scarcely speak a word
of Chinese, are as crazy as others.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some of the Siamese have also
had their equilibrium somewhat
disturbed, which they will scarcely
be able to regain during the next
month, when their own New year
commences. And then in an-
other month comes the Song-Kran
when the Siamese become as nearly
crazy as it is possible to be and not
experience the reality. We may
therefore expect nothing but trou-
ble with servants for the next
three months.{{< /news/text >}}

AN HISTORIC RELIC.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Rev. Mr. Mattoon, of this city, through
the politeness of Mr. G. A. Finck, who has
recently returned from China, has been
made the recipient of a beautifully finished
walking stick. This stick is a present to
Mr. Mattoon, from Capt. F. W. Harvey, of
the British ship "Harvest Home".{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It has also an historic reminiscence. It is
made from a piece of oak taken from the
old ship Minden, which figured as prison-
ship in the war of 1812, and on board of
whlch Francis Key composed the "Star
Spangled Banner," on Sept. 12th, 1814.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On that day the British fleet made an
attack upon Fort Mc Henry near Baltimore.
Early in the morning Mr. Key had gone on
board the fleet, to ask the release of some
prisoners, and was detained on board the
Minden during the day, and whllst the ac-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}tion was progressing, he composed the "Star
Spangled Banner". The Minden was sold in
Canton, in 1862 to the Chinese, who broke
her up, for the timber, iron, and copper,
she contained.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Rev. J.C. Nevin, Missionary of the United
Presbyterian Church, secured a block of
wood from the vessel, upon which he had
executed the following design. On one side
is carved the Union flag, with fifteen stars
and fifteen stripes, and the beginning and
closing words of the "Star Spangled Ban-
ner" The date of the battle is also given,
1814. The character of the Minden during
the war is represented by a pair of manacles,
and chains. On the other side the Canton
date is given, and there is a broken cannon,
and anchor, showing that the ship is destroy-
ed. The design was beautifully executed
by a Chinaman, whose name and place of
business, appear in Chinese characters on
the end of the block. Thus designed, the
block was sent by Mr. Nevins, and presented
to Mayor Henry of Philadelphia, to be placed
in Independence Hall in that city.{{< /news/text >}}

FOR THE BANGKOK RECORDER,
PETCHABUREE
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}This year was ushered in at Petchaburee
with a ceremony, which the place has never
witnessed before. The unusual size and
amount of preparations beforehand betoken-
ed something extra. Were two hundred
thousand bamboo trees brought, and three
spacious buildings erected, and that large
enclosures made for the purpose of holding
A FAIR! It would be well if they were ever
used for any thing less advantageous.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The occasion for all this preparation is the
hair-cutting of two young princesses in the
family of His Majesty the First King. The
royal train arrived at Ban-Mai, the royal
landing on Thursday the 5th January, and
proceeded from thence by carriage to the
Royal Country Palace, which is situated on
the summit of a small mount.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The landing place is three or four miles
below the town, and connected with it by
a beautifully smooth road, along which it
is a great treat to ride or drive, a luxury not
every where to be enjoyed in this country.
The visitor here is agreeably disappointed
to find roads leading in almost every direc-
tion, and through the kindness of the enter-
prising and gentlemanly Lieut. Governor
he will hardly ever tire of having horses, and
carriages at his command.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The road across the plain from the river
to the palace summit is about three fifths of
a mile long. Here the grand royal process-
ion took place. This road was guarded on
each side by various ornamental standards
of lattice work, and covered with matting.
The grand proceession commenced on Fri-
day the 13th and conitnued, one each day,
till Monday, when at an early hour the
"top knot" was removed.{{< /news/text >}}
</div>
{{< news/br >}}

<div class='article'>
{{< news/text >}}The dress of the young princesses, while
in procession, was Oriental in style and
magnificence, consisting principally of gold
and diamonds ;—a neat and beautiful little
crown of curiously wrought gold, and stud-
ded with diamonds—a broad collar cover-
ing the shoulders which seemed to be a net
work of gold and jewels—necklace—brace-
lets—anklets—and the tiny little slippers—
all of the same costly materials. This must
have been, like the ancient coat of mail, no
easy burden to bear, for I saw one of the
young Princesses breathing heavily as
though she were uneasy under all this
weight of jewelry. They were seated in
nicely gilded chairs borne on men's should-
ers, and attended, each by twelve noble-
men richly and beautifully dressed, but
strangely disfigured with a one-horned hat
on their heads.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The whole procession was a motley com-
pany composed of soldiers, pioneers, bands
of music, standard bearers, and persons
variously dressed, representing different na-
tionalities, such as Chinese, Malay, Peguan,
Karen, Hindoo, and European. That re-
presenting the ancient style of Siamese
dress, looked very genteel and becoming,
and would add much to their appearance
if in vogue now. The only objectionable
feature of the whole appearance was a laugh-
able attempt to imitate an European lady's
dress.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The tonsure took place in a beautifully
decorated hall adjoining the palace on the
summit. The little beauties were seat-
up on a mat on the floor while the atten-
dants proceeded to remove the miniature
crown of gold, and, unloose the knot of hair
and prepare it for taking its final leave of
its very youthful heads.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Precious lock of hair ! You must now
be laid aside. Your ornament is no longer
needed. Never again will there be the
same magnificent display made for you.
Prepare to take your leave.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty, assisted by two princes, with
a pair of barber shears soon removed the
cherished locks, amidst a deafening jargon
from Brahman conch, brazen horn, flagelet,
and a variety of other instruments of un-
harmonious sound, and the children were
conducted out to bathe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Adjoining the hall was an artificial moun-
tain, in one of the crevices of which was a
miniature throne with a white canopy
where they took their seats. Immediately
above them, among the artificial crags pro-
jected, the heads of four different animals
representing the four quarters of the globe,
out of the mouths of which came water
sprinkling the “hairless scalps beneath.
His Majesty then poured water upon each
of their heads from a small shell which had
been used by his royal ancestors in the old
capital four generations ago. This ceremony
of puring water was followed up by a few
others, while the poor little sufferers sat
shivering in their wet garments in the fresh
morning breeze; and each splash of the
water called forth a deep drawn sigh, which
seemed to say "touch lightly."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The whole pageant was Oriental in style,
and princely in magnificence, and closed
up on Wedsesday evening with royal fire-
worke on the summit, a little out of the
usual order. It is not often His Majesty
entertains his cortege with so brilliant and
startling a display of the power of fire to
consume attap roof, and buildings entire as
was witnessed that evening.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
COMMISIONER OF POLICE
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our neighbor of "The Siam Times" oc-
cupies several columns of his last issue with
the affairs of the above named official. We
had not designed to make them the subject of
comment, and only do so now, to correct
what we regard a serious error, which our
neighbor of "The Siam Times" has made in
the advice which he offers to the Commis-
sioner of Police.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"We think this the more necessary, as
our neighbor claims to be the adviser of the
Ruling Powers, and because of the "ex-ca-
thedra" it risks in which the advice is given.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We entertain none but the most friendly
sentiments toward the Commissioner of
Police, and will cheerfully do all in our
power to render his official position the
least embarrassing to himself, and most
useful to his employers, and the community
in general. But we cannot think it the part
of true friendship either to the Commis-
sioner, or to the Siamese government, to
ignore Treaty obligatious, and give advice,
which, if followed, must inevitably lead to
fresh complications.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our neighbor advises the Commissioner
to apply to the Siamese government, his
employers, for Magistrerial powers, and
then adds: "This secured, your acts in fin-
ing, imprisoning, or flogging any of the
members of the force under your control,
will be official acts, for the performance of
which you will be answerable only to the
Siamese tribunals."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Can it be possible that our neighbor does
not know, that while existing Treaties are
in force, the Siamese government can
neither give nor exercise Magisterial au-
thority over the subjects of any of the
Treaty Powers? No commission, no author-
ity, which the Siamese government can
grant, can remove the acts of the Commis-
sioner toward British subjects, whether they
be official, semi-official, or private, from un-
der the jurisdiction of the British Consul.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If there is any change, the second remedy
which our neighbor proposes we think the
right one. Let the members of the Police
force be Siamese subjects, and let the Siam-
ese government clearly define, the extent
of the authority, which the Commissioner
has over them. The Commissioner would still
be under British jurisdiction; but no com-
plaint of any member of his force could
come before the Consul, except through
the regular Siamese Official channels, and
he would not be liable, unless he had both
committed a breach of British law, and
transgressed the powers given him by the
Siamese government.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}If suitable persons, subjects of Siam can
not be found for the purpose of the Po-
lice, the only course is for the Commission-
er to submit to the necessities of his po-
sition, and bring any member of his force,
who may have committed himself, before
the Consul of the Country of which he is
a subject for punishment. It appears to
us both useless, and unwise, for either the
Commissioner or the community to "run
a muck" against legitimate Consular au-
thority in whatever lands it may be found.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
FOR THE BANGKOK RECORDER.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The lull in our business affairs though
not at all desirable, will doubtless not pass
without effecting its intended good. It will
give us time to breathe, as well as afford time
for reflection, and the enlargement of our
acquaintance with the world. Had this
been an ordinary year bringing its usual
good crop of the great staple of the country,
those of us engaged in business would doubt-
less have been buying rice, and loading
ships as usual, scarcely allowing our thoughts
to range beyond the regular routine of bus-
iness and thus unconsciously becoming men
of one idea.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As we take a retrospect of the last four
or five years, we see great changes in the
commercial world, as well as in the political.
These have been effected to a great extent
by revolutions in the political. In the
United States, King Cotton had acquired a
power almost absolute, and was supported
upon his throne by a powerful aristocracy.
Nor was his power confined to his own
dominions alone, but extended across the
Atlantic to Europe. Relying upon his in-
fluence abroad, he attempted a movement
which proved his ruin. He soon found his
ports blockaded, and his own carcass, useless
to himself, left to rot upon his own soil.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As a consequence, across the Atlantic
thousands of operatives, who had hitherto
been able to make a respectable living, were
thrown out of employment, and became
objects of charity, and many who appeared
to be doing a good business, became insol-
vent. American shipping too, by heretofore
practicers, was driven almost wholly from
the sea.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In Siam, however, we were apparently
safe. Free from the civil wars of America,
and China, and also apparently free from
any difficulty from without, the merchants
felt conparatively secure. Holding the
keys, as it were, of the "rice granary of the
world," the rest of the world might fight it
out, and we could supply them with rice.
A few short months pass away, and our go-
downs are empty, our rice mills are silent,
and we are apparently upon the verge of a
famine. The usual copious rains of the
season have been in a great measure with
held, and as a consequence the crop is a
failure.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Those of us who hold to particular prov
idences, of course feel that the Sovereign
Ruler of the universe, has some great object
to accomplish by this, and which is yet to
be developed. What that object is we dare
securely conjecture.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It may, for ought we know, be to develope
further the resources of this country. It
may be made the means of turning the at-
tention of both natives and foreigners more
particularly to the cultivations of rice. If
with their dilatory habits, and imperfect
modes of farming, Siam may without exag-
geration be called, the "rice granary of the
world," which might not be expanded with
a proper degree of industry, and improved
modes of cultivation. This then may be
the means of causing the people to throw
away their outdate utensils, and make-shift
ways of farming. They may also be made
to turn their attention to proper modes of
irrigation, so that they may not be so much
dependent on the flooding of the country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This scarcity of rice too may be made
the means of discovering some hitherto un-
known sources of wealth, and of turning the
tion participation of commerce in quite a
different direction. Most of the useful in-
ventions have at first been looked upon as
Calamities.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Previously to the outbreak of the rebellion,
in the United States, labor saving machines
were very greatly increased. Many of the
laboring classes looked upon them with a
jealous eye, and considered them as taking
the bread out of their own months.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Thousands of women in the larger cities
made a doleful living by the use of their
needles, but upon the introduction of the
sewing machine they were apparently de
prived of even that. Farming utensils such
as planting machines, and reaping machines
were also greatly increased, with apparently
the same effect.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After the outbreak of the rebellion how-
ever, an overruling Providence could be seen
in all these. Without the sewing machine
the vast army of the Union, could never
have been properly clothed, and without
the other labor-saving machines the seed
could never have been planted, and the har-
vest gathered. Those same laboring classes
too, who were apparently thrown out of em-
ployment, have been able at other employ
ments almost to quadruple their former
wages.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}King cotton was about to be dethroned,
but near the same time we discovered that
which is likely to prove an inexhaustible
source of wealth. Had any one come for-
ward seven years ago, and declared that
beneath the disported strats of Western
Pennsylvania, and Western Virginia — many
places upon those surface, appeared to have
been intended by nature, for the lair of the
wild beast, or the growth of Whortleberries-
there was deposited pure oil enough to burn
up creation, he would have been looked upon
as a mad-man. The good people of that
region would doubtless have taken pains
to place him in one of those human institu
tions called insane asylums.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Although so lately discovered; there are
in the oil business, in different portions of the
United States, over two hundred and fifty
companies, with an aggregate capital of one
hundred and forty millions of dollars. Vast
quantities are also exported to Europe, and
different other parts of the world. This
has also created a corresponding revolution
in lamps, and burners. The old are thrown
aside, and replaced by new. A house in
New York, has received from Russia, an or-
der for two hundred thousand dollars worth
of petroleum lamps.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}That same nature has been at work here.
She has upheaved from the bed of the sea
beautiful islands. Upon the main land too,
which the sea appears to have covered at
one time and then receded, that same in-
ternal power has been felt. Mountains with
distorted and rugged rock, rise up above
the plain, and some of them even appear as
if they might have been thrown from a dis-
tance and placed upon the surface. Among
the distorted straits of same of these, them
may be a source of wealth, as powerful, as
that arising in the form of the rice crop,
from the alluvial deposits of the valley of
the Mehnam Chow Pya.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another thought too suggests itself.
There is also here an apparent decline in
the cocoa nut. The scarcity of the nut to-
gether with the high tax imposed upon the
tree makes oil very dear. It has doubled
within the last four years. Might not pre-
troleum be imported, and sold at least as
cheaply per gallon as oil produced from the
cocoa nut?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We venture to assert therefore that there
is still some undiscovered sources of trade
here. Who will find them? This too is
beautiful weather for tearing, and exploring

LOSS OF ENGLISH SCHR. FAI KEE,
Capr. Howland.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Statement of the Mate, Mr. G. E. Sands
who arrived here on Saturday 21st, Jan.
1865.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nov. 21st, Left the anchorage with a full
cargo, consisting of teak logs, and planks
in the lower hold, rice and pepper in the
tween docks, with some sapanwood for
stowage. The ship was stanch and tight
with a full crew, consisting of Capt., Mate,
second Mate, Carpenter, (Steward, Cook,
both Chinese) one boy, and five hands be-
fore the mast. The ship was well found in
sails, rigging and every thing necessary for
the intended voyage. The prevailing winds
at, and after starting, were light and vari-
able, and nothing of any consequence
occurred up to the 24th. Noon, Lat. by
observation 12° 49' N. Long, uncertain, not
having the Log book, it being in the posses-
sion of the Capt. Wind, light northerly,
all sail set to the best advantage, pumps in
good order, and regularly attended, ship
making no water, 8 P.M. calm; 10, Light
breeze, N. E. midnight, breeze N. E. fresh
ening. 8 A. M. 25th, blowing fresh, took in
light sails, day light, wind steadily increas-
ing, with heavy sea, 6 A. M. sounded
the pumps, and found two feet water in the
hold, rigged and manned both pumps, and
kept them going till 8 A. M. when one of
the men, having occasion to go below into
the forecastle, reported "water coming
through the seams of the deck." We opened
the fore hatch, and went below, when we
found the lower hold full of water, some of
the hands were sent with buckets to bail, and
both pumps were kept a going; but all our
efforts were in vain, the water gaining ra-
pidly upon us. We then shortened sail and
got the ship before the wind, 9 P. M. hold
full of water. One of the men reported a
sail in sight, which proved to be the Ham-
burg Barque Superb. We signalled her,
and got out the long boat.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I went on board of the Superb, when the
Capt. asked, if we wished to be taken off
the wreck, and offered to take us all on
board of the Superb, if we wished to go.
I thanked him for his kindness, but de-
clined accepting of his offer, knowing that
the ship would keep above water, we hoped
to be able to reach some port in the Gulf
with her in safety. I requested the Capt.
to furnish us with provisions, our own
having been rendered useless by salt water.
He kindly supplied our wants, and we re-
turned to the ship, dropped the boat astern
and filled away the yards.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After parting company with the Superb,
we steered as near west as the wind N. E.
E. would permit us to do with safety yards.
The fore and aft sails being stowed. During
the day the wind veered and hauled be-
tween North and East meantime the ship
made about a W. S. W. course. 2½ knots
per hour. At sun set, we lowered the
quarter boat from the davits, and dropped
her astern with the long boat.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The water in the hold being all afloat; a
slight squall would capsize the ship, it was
therefore prudent to be prepared for what-
ever might happen.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The ship having filled so rapidly, in three
hours, at 6 A.M. when we commenced pump-
ing there was only two feet water in the
hold, and at 9 A. M. the ship settled down,
her hold being full of water, we had no
time to save any thing belonging to us, and
when we had time, we could not save any
thing, all being under water, all the pro-
visions we had, were about 100 lbs bread,
three hams, a few pomeloes, and one bucket
about two gallons of water. 3 P. M. wind
moderate, midnight, squally, I went into the
long boat, leaving the 2nd Mate in charge
of the ship, with orders, not to leave her
if the breeze freshened. About 2 P. M. on
the morning of the 26th, while in the long
boat, I was awoke by a noise, and the words
"Hard up," uttered in a loud voice, upon
jumping up, I found that a squall had struck
the ship on her starboard beam, and she
was int he act of rolling over on her beam
ends. At this time the ship capsized, the
steward, cook and one seaman was in the
long boat with me, the carpenter and boy in
the other. I ordered the boats to be cut
away from the ship, which was done, and we
went to the assistance of the remainder of
the crew, and succeeded in getting them all
into the boats in safety.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We divided the crew, the Capt, 2nd mate,
carpenter two seamen and boy into one boat,
mate, steward, cook, and three seamen in the
other, and shaped our course for the land.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Immediately after we left the wreck, I
found that one of the pintles, which the
rudder hung, was broken off close the
stern, so that I had great difficulty in keep-
ing her near her course, this together with the
darkness of the night, and the heavy sea,
caused our boats to part company. Soon
after this the other pintle drew out of
the bands stern, and then I had to take
one of the three oars which we had pulling
to steer with, we continued pulling till day-
light, we then put in the oars and com-
menced rigging a sail, taking an oar for a
mast, and a bed-tick, belonging to the
Chinese steward, for a sail, in this way we
were soon enabled to go ahead, at the rate
of about five knots per hour.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As soon as we got all finished, and the
boat going ahead, we commenced our morn-
ing meal, having eaten but little the day pre-
vious. ( for my own part I had only eaten
a piece of biscuit, and raw meat, on the day
before, we having discovered the leak but
before breakfast ) our present meal consisted
of the same viz.—biscuit, raw ham, and a
piece of pomaloe, wishing to save our
water, we did not use any of it then.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We had a fine breeze all that day, and
through the night, at about 3 A. M. we
made the land, and about 4 A. M. found
that we were not far enough to windward to
get into Pathieu, so we kept away, and ran
into the bay of Kow Lanng, where we found
a native Junk in course of building. There
were only the workmen, and two or three
women, who cooked for them, in this place.
We hauled our boat up on the beach, the
natives voluntarily assisting us.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We soon made our condition known to
them, telling them if they would assist us,
we would give them some of our clothes,
as we could not pay them in any other way,
they then once gave us every assistance in their
power. We got a mast out in the woods,
and a spar for an oar, ( having lost one of
those we had ) a new thaft, and the rudder
fixed, while some of our men were getting
our sail, and fitted rigging for the mast,
this we made out of the piece of rope which
had been cut from the ship's stern, when
she went on her beam ends, by unlaying
the strands, and laying them up again into
small rope. In this way we got every thing
fitted, and were enabled to leave again on
the afternoon of the 28th. We had a heavy
sea to contend with, and broke one of our
oars in doing so, but finally succeeded, and
stood off shore for the best part of the night,
on the morning of the 29th, we stood in
again, and found that we had gone to lee-
ward and was not able to fetch the place
we had left. I then thought, of a new rig
for the boat. I rigged a kind of jigger sail
to keep the boat from going so much to
leeward; this was soon done, with a blanket
for a sail, and some spare spars, which we
took with us from the shore, we stood close
into the land, making short tacks, during
the night, but in the morning found that we
were sill getting to leeward. The weather
was fine, the breeze moderate, but in her
present condition, there was no hope of
working the boat up the coast. Having
neither compass, chart, nor any thing to
assist me, and with but little knowledge of
the coast, I scarcely knew what to do, but
Providence sent a Chinese Junk in our way,
and as soon as we saw her, we stood across
her bows, so as to be able to speak her. I
then told the Chinamen in the boat what to
say to the Captain of the Junk who informed
us, that Champoon was the best place for
us to go, there being a man there who spoke
English, and the Governor lived there; he
promised, if we would follow the Junk, as
they were going close to Champoan, that
he would send a man with us to show us
the way, we then kept away after the Junk,
they kindly gave us some cooked rice and
fish.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}About 5 P. M. we arrived at Thong-Kat,
the Captain of the Junk ( who was also the
owner ) living here, we remained at his
house for the night ( by his invitation ) he
treated us very kindly, giving us supper
with himself and family, some of the men
slept in the boat, the two Chinamen and I
slept in the house belonging to the owner
of the junk, who sent mats, and pillows for
us to sleep on.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This place seemed to be chiefly inhabited
by Chinese, having Siamese wives, and was
very well cultivated. Several of them came
and brought us to there houses, and offered
us fruit, tea, cigars &c.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next morning Dec, 1st the two Chinese
reported, that there clothes had been stolen
in the night; they had a small bundle tied
in a handkerchief, which they brought out
of the boat, and put in the place where they
slept, I did not trouble myself about this
till I arrived at Champoon, when I reported
it to the Governor, who made the owner of
the Junk, pay for them, in failing to find
the thief, ( I was very sorry for this ).{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As soon as we had breakfast the Chinese
Captain sent two men with us in the boat,
and in about four hours, we reached Capt.
Corderio’s at Champoon, who received us
kindly, and reported our arrival to the
Siamese authorities in the village, but he
failed to report us to the Governor.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 3rd Dec. Capt. C, went with me
to the Governor, who received me very
kindly, and expressed his sorrow at not
hearing of our arrival sooner, he promised
to send us to Bangkok, but having heard
the day previous, from a Chinaman that
Capt. H. was at Pathieu, I requested him,
to give me a boat, that I might go to P.
and see if the Capt. had arrived. He cheer-
fully granted my request, and also said,
that if Capt. H, could be found any where
on the coast, it would give him a great plea-
sure, to be able to forward us all to Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next day Dec. 4th, I left Champoon, in
search of Capt. H, and his boats crew, I
had four natives, to row the boat, and the
ships cook as interpreter. We pulled up
the coast, keeping a good look out as we
went along, but we did not see any thing
of the Captain’s boat. We arrived at Bansuan
in the night, but could not get the boat in,
as it was low water, so we waited until the
tide made, when I went ashore, but received
no intelligence whatever about the boat or
crew. Next morning 5th, we left Bansuan,
and pulled round the Head; but there being
a strong breeze, and a heavy sea, the boat’s
crew would not proceed any further, and
much against my will, we beached the boat
in the next little bay.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I was very anxious to get to Pathieu and
hearing that I could walk thero in a short
time, I took two of the boat crew, and the
cook, and started on foot. We traveled along
the beach which is a fine sandy one, covered
with a variety of shells, and some shell
fish a species of clam, with a very hand-
home shell. After we traveled about
two miles, the sand being soft, and our feet
sinking into it, my shoes (canvas) gave out,
and impeded my progress, the natives tra-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}veiling fast, I could not keep up with them,
so I off shoes and tried the bare deet I could
not get on very well owing to the sharpness
of the shells, and the tenderness of my feet.
However I got along at a passable rate, un-
til we came to the rocks at the next Cape-
or Headland, these we had to climb over,
they were very sharp, being a kind of slate
stone, with the edges up and craggy. By
this time the tide was so high that we
could not travel on the beach, so we
were obliged to clamber over the rocks,
which was tedious and painful to me. The
natives of course, did not mind it their feet
being hard, having got over these rocks,
we fell in with a path through the woods,
this we followed, cutting off the next Head-
land, here I got well picked with thorns.
In this way we traveled alone wading
streams, climbing rocks and scrambling
through the jungle, until we came to a house,
where we learned that a little farther on, the
second Governor had his residence. We
pushed on till dark, when we arrived at
the second Governor's, about seven or eight
miles from Pathieu, where we rested for the
night, during my journey I found my guides
of little or no use, because they did not
know the road.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Governor, and his family were very
kind, provided supper for us, and observing
that my clothes were wet, they offered me
some of thier own which were dry, which
I accepted, and put on, (to the no small
amusement of the company,) till next morn-
ing when I resumed my own. I slept but
little during the night, my feet and limbs
being sore.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Next morning 6th we resumed our jour-
ney and arrived about noon at Pathieu , and
went to the first Governor, there I was in-
formed to Capt H. and been here, but
had only called, and got some rice &c.
and left immediately, the person (a China-
man) who had supplied him, being then
the Governor's, told me that he (the
Chimaman) offered Capt. H. a little money
to help him on his way, which was refused
by Capt. II.who then started for Bangkok.
I informed the Gov. of the reason why I
came and of my inability to walk any dis-
tance, requesting him to send me in a boat
to the place where I had left my boat.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After having some refreshments, an offi-
cer went with us to the village, and pro-
cured a boat. We started at about 7 P. M.
having the wind and sea in our favor, we
went rapidly along and at midnight arrived
at the place where we left the boat, but it
being low water, we had to get out and
wade for about half a mile, leaving the boat
outside of the flats. I told the boat-man to
rumain till we had found our own boat,
but not being able to do so, we returned to
where we had left the boat, and to our
surprise found that she was also gone. This
was rather unfortunate, but there was no
help for it. and we had to remain on the
beach all night. We went in quest of wood
to make a fire, (this was attended with
some little danger, there being some tigers
prowling about our neighborhood.) Having
collected a small quantity of wood, and a
flint and steel being at hand, a fire was
soon kindled. For each took a fire brand in
hand, and went in search of more wood,
having got enough we made a good fire by
which we remained till morning. At day-
light we went to take a more minute
search for the boat, when we found the
tracks of a tiger in the sand, about
fourteen yards from the fire. Not finding
the boat, we concluded that the men who
were in charge of her, had taken her back
to Bansuan, we entered the jungle and
returned to Bansuan where we found the
boat, and continuing our journey, we ar-
rived at Champoon on the 8th.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I went to Capt. Cordiero's instead of go-
ing to the Governor’s, my feet being fes-
terer and swelled I could not walk, and
for several days I did not go outside the
house.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Capt. C. reported my arrival to the Gov-
ernor who concluded to forward me to Bang-
kok on elephants, however I heard noth-
ing more till the 14th when Capt. C. who
was then going to visit the tin mines went
to the Governor, who had promised to
give him elephants for his journey, taking
one of my men with him who had volun-
teered to accompany him. In the evening
I received a note stating that the Governor
desired the party to come to his house.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}15th—We took our boat and went to
the Governor’s about 3 miles further up the
river, who gave us a place to live in, opposite
his own house, providing every thing neces-
sary for our comfort, appointing a man to
provide food for us every day, telling us he
wished any thing more to let him
know. Fruit, fish, pork, eggs and other
nic naks sent from his own house to us,
and with all this expressing sorrow for be-
ing unable to add to our comforts.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I cannot speak too highly in praise of
the Governor of Champoon, he spared nei-
ther trouble nor expence to obtain whatever
he thought would add to our comfort
while we were with him.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We would not have been delayed so
long had we not waited for the party
which the Governor as about to send on
duty to Bangkok, circumstances prevented
him from doing so, up to the 23d, when
our party, now reduced to three. Richard
Mc Auley having gone to the mines with
Capt. C. and the two Chinese remaining in
Champoon, myself and two seaman, one
of them ( Charles Herring ) being sick,
embarked in the ship’s boat, with four
men from the Governor to row the boat,
and in company with a boat belonging to the
Governor’s party on the 26th we returned to
Champoon, not being able to get along
the coast. * * * *{{< /news/text >}}

THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.

SHERMAN'S MARCH THROUGH GEORGIA.
FROM THE "OVERLAND MAIL" OF Dec. 10th
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The main interest of the news from America still
centres in General Sherman's movements. There
is now no doubt as to the direction in which that
general bent steps after evacutating and destroy-
ing Atlanta, but the Intelligenceconcerning his prog-
ress as yet comes entirely from Confederate sources
and is very contrdictory. The latest communica-
tion received direct from Sherman in the following
telegram to his wife, dated Kingston, Georgia Nov.
9:—"I have received all your letters up to the 3rd.
I start to morrow. Write no more and don't expect
to hear from me except through rebel sources for
some time to come. Good bye".{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the same day, Nov 9th Sherman issued or-
ders for his march, announcing that the army would
move in two wings by four roads when practicable,
the right wing under Howard composed of the 15th
and 17th corps, and the left, under Slocam, com-
prising the 14th and 20th corps. There was to be a
general train of supplies, and ammunition wagons
and ambulances were to be distributed among the
different regiments. Foraging parties were to be
vigorously employed in all directions. The troops
were forbidden to enter private dwellings, but could
gather supplies and drive in stock freely.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The wings of the Federal Army are described as
stretching away miles across the country, foraging as
they marched and the Georgia journels complain that
Shermann is devastating the country, wholly contrary
to the terms of his order. He is said to have burnt
Jonesboro, Griffin, Stone Mountain, Hillsborough
Clinton, and other towns, including the residences
of Governer Brown.Telegraphic communciation
between Macon, Milledgeville, and Savannah has
been destroyed. All the country between the Georgia
central railway has been swept. Richmond papers
of the 23rd Nov. publish an unconfirmed report to
the effect that Shermann has captured and burnt
Macon and Milledgeville, and was advancing towards
Savannah. The steamer Atlantic, which left Savan-
nah River on the 22nd, brings the same news as
a "current rumour," and both have probably the
same sources. On the other hand, Georgian papers
say that Shermann had not occupied Macon up to the
21st, which may probably mean the evening of the
25th—a statement likely appear to be correct if it is
true as alleged in a previous telegram, that he was
18 miles from Macon on the 19th. Advices of the
20th relate that Sherman's advance had reached
Gordon on the Savannah railroad "60 miles east of
Macon," Now Gordon is not 60 miles east of Macon,
but barely 25 miles.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Northern papers stated at the outset that while
the bulk of Sherman's army marched southeast to
Macon, one or two corps marched due East towards
Augusta. In all probability this and body of troops
marches along the Augusta line as far as Covington,
destroying the town call Stone Mountain and the
other stations along their root, and at Covington thrn-
ed off towards Macon. The road, which on this
supposition they must have taken, would lead them
through Monticello, Hillsborough, and Clinton, the
towns reported to have been destroyed, and enabled
the to rejoin Sherman either at Macon or at Gor-
don, where, as we have seen, the latest reports placed
him. He would then have his entire force within
reach to proceed either towards Augusta or Savan-
nah, places which he is not liekly to approach with
a divided army. Macon is said to be strongly for-
tified and it was thought that Sherman might not
attack it, but move directly upon Augusta, and sub-
sequently upon Savannah.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}President Lincoln has proclaimed that the block ade
at Norfork, Virginia, and Frenands Pensacola, Flor-
ida, shall be raised, and these ports open to domes-
tic and foreign commerce on and after the 1st prox-
imo, subject to the necessities of war.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}New York was thrown into a state of panic on the
night of the 26th Ult., by the discovery of a horrible
attempt to burn down the city. Between nice and
ten o'clock fires were discovered in eight of the prin-
cipal hotels, to two of which theatres were attached,
and also in Baraum's Museum, which was crowded
at the time with women and childre. The means
adopted by the incendiaries were the same in each
instance. Some person or persons unknown en-
gaged a room at the hotels, placed phosphorus and
other combustibles under the beds, or in the bed
clothes, set fire to them, and then retired, locking
the doors after them. These attempts were, no doubt,
intended to be simultaneous, but from some cause
not explained, an interval of an hour or an hour and
a half elapsed between the earliest and the latest.
Fortunately the fires were easily extinguished Two
persons are in custody on suspicion of being con-
cerned in this affair, and it is supposed that Con-
federate emisarises are connected with it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Hon. Reuben E. Fenton Governor-elect of the
State of New York, in responding to a serenade at
the Astor Honse, stated that hereafter the State shall
occupy no hesitating or equivocal position. The is-
sue presented to the people, he said, was whether
they would maintain the government in its integ-
grity, or whether the advantages gained over the
Confederates should be surrendered, thus acknow-
ledging the inability of the North to maintain the 
contest, and becoming the laughing stock and de- 
rision of mankind.{{< /news/text >}}

FRANCE
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Count of Correctional Appeal in Paris has
affirmed the judgment in the court below with respect
to the thirteen deputues who were defneded by M.Ber-
ryer and other eniment lawyers. Thirteen gentle-
men, it will be remembered, were prosecuted by
the Imperial Government for holding what was
alleged to be an illegal meeting. They were part of
a permanent election committee; and it appears that
the law permits twenty persons to meet under cer-
tain circumstances, only thirteen were put on their
trial, and condemned, and an appeal was carried to
the Correctional tribunal in favor either of the dis-
missal of the accused, or that their colleagues should
be tried along with them. The court, however,
merely confirmed the sentence of the court below.{{< /news/text >}}

AUSTRIA
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Lower House of the Austrian Reichsrath has
concluded its debate on the address to the Throne.
The draft of the address was adopted, and will be
at once sent to the Emperor in writing. The address
is liberal and progressive in many of its expressions,
and denotes a decided tendency towards conciliation
within the empire and peaceful relations abroad.
One paragraph calling for an official statement of
the causes and the results of the state of siege now
existing is Gallacia, was adopted despite the stren-
uous resistance of the Miniscura.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the sitting of the Frank fort Dist on the 15th
inst. the Austro-Prussian proposition for the evacu-
ation of Holstein and Lauenberg by the Federal troops
was carried by nine votes against six. Saxony,
Bavaria, Wurtemberg, and Darmstadt voted with
the minority. The representatives of Austria and
Prussia then intimated that the civil Commission-
ers of the two powers in Sehleswig would likewise
undertake the admimistratio of Holstein and Lau-
enborg. It is felt in the Prissian capital, that M.de
Bismark will be triumphant also in naming the
succession to the throne of the Duchies. Austria and
Prussia, it is said, claim the right of nominating
to the Diet a proper representative in the successions,
and there is little hope of the appointment being
made in any other manner.{{< /news/text >}}

is said, wished to visit and pay homage to him, but
the authorities forbade them, and arrested several
persons in consequence of their persistence. Another
telegram states that a deputation of 3,000 Schleswig-
ers waited upon the King, and presented an address
to him, declaring their desire to remain under his
rule.{{< /news/text >}}

REMARKABLE DELIVERANCE— At the
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}battle of Stone River, a young man, a
member of the Board of Trade Battery—
and also a member of the First Baptist
Church, Chicago— was detailed, with others,
as a postillion to take charge of the horses
while detached from the guns. He sat down
behind a stump. Presently the thought
struck him, "It looks cowardly for me to
be sitting here while the rest of the boys
stand out there exposed and unprotected,"
and upon the impulse sprang up. He had
scarcely gone a halter's length when a can-
non ball struck the stump and shivered it to
atoms, and would have killed him instantly
had he remained in his seat two seconds
longer!{{< /news/text >}}
