{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/indent1 >}}Down in the deep where the still waters sleep

{{< news/indent2 >}}On the coral beds pillow'd with sand,

{{< news/indent1 >}}And the Kings of the Sea their watchfullness keep

{{< news/indent2 >}}O'er the treasures of many a land,

{{< news/indent1 >}}I've a jewel more precious to me than the mines

{{< news/indent2 >}}With their diamonds of beauty untold;

{{< news/indent1 >}}A gem that in lustre unfading outshines

{{< news/indent2 >}}The purest of India's gold.

{{< news/indent1 >}}It was set in the crown of my joy long ago

{{< news/indent2 >}}And the pride of my heart was its throne,

{{< news/indent1 >}}Where the light of its purity beamed in the glow

{{< news/indent2 >}}Of a love that no mortal hath known.

{{< news/indent1 >}}Save I, and my little one sleeping so still,

{{< news/indent2 >}}And who never can come back to me,

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
George Stephenson.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Continued from No. 12.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 28th November, 1802,
George being a few months more than
twenty-one years of age, he married
at Newburn Church his beloved Fanny
Henderson, and took her to his newhome
at Willington Quay, six miles from
Newcastle. His industry had made a
nest little home for his young wife,
and she was sure to add to its comfort.
The sisters of Fanny had married
men in better worldly stations than
George Stephenson, but they were all
of a good stock—-capital housewives,
and full of warm-hearted sympathies
—-so that, by his happy union, George,
had now a new and prosperous family
circle.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With new duties came new energy.
From mending shoes, George took to
making them, and he drove a good
trade in making shoe-lasts, which
were soon found of great excellence.
An accident happened at his cottage
that developed the young husband's
mechanical skill. While he was absent
one day, the chimney took fire, and
the neighbours, in putting it out,
swamped the dwelling with water, and
injured what was most prised[?] of all,
the eight-day clock. To send this to
a clock-maker for repairs would cost
more than they could afford. &c.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}George set himself to work to mend
the clock, and succeeded so well that
his neighbours from that time sent
him their clocks to repair, and gave
him the name of "the clock doctor."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 16th of December, 1803,
the young parents rejoiced over their
first-born, and as it proved, their only
child, now a man of world-wide cele-
brity. It marks the filial piety of
George, that he called his son after
his own worthy aged father, Robert,
little dreaming that M. P. would in
time be put after that name, and the
world would be the better for the
genius of Robert Stephenson as it has
been for that of his father.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The warm heart that had given its
love to so many dumb creatures was
sure to have plenty to bestow upon
this last dear claimant. His wife and
child were indeed a crown of rejoic-
ing. Perhaps the humble home, glad-
dened by their smiles, was too happy
for this earth—-certain it is, the light
of joy was soon to be quenched in
tears. The year after the infant was
born, the good and gentle mother was
called away to a heavenly home, and
her husband and babe were left deso-
late. With all the strength of his
strong nature must George Stephenson
have mourned his loss. His helpless
child was the best earthly comforter.
For his sake the grief must be borne,
the desolate future fronted with a calm
resolution, however the heart might
ache.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was a mercy that entire change
of scene came at that dreary time.
George Stephenson was invited to su-
perintend the working of a new en-
gine, at some works near Montrose, in
Scotland. Leaving his boy in good
care, he set out, and performed the
long journey on foot. He who has
given us railroads that we can traverse
with comfort and ease, at a penny a
mile, had then to tramp with his kit
on his back, a much more expensive
way, say nothing of the fatigue, but
there was then no help for it. He was
in Scotland a year—-paid regularly for
his child's maintenance, and contrived
to save £28. He wanted to make some
alterations in the engine, this led to a
disagreement, and longing to get back
to his child, he gave up his work, and
trudged back again. On the way, when
foot-sore and weary, he knocked at a
cottage and asked shelter, he was re-
fused. He entreated to be permitted
to lie down on some straw in an out-
house, the good woman, struck by his
manner, overcome her husband's re-
luctance, and they admitted him to
their fireside. He repaid their hospi-
tality by his pleasant conversation,
and they were so pleased with him,
that when, on the morrow, he offered
to pay them, they refused to take
money, asking only to be remembered
kindly. Many years after, when Step-
henson became a rich man, he called
upon this couple, who were not a lit-
tle surprised to find what a distin-
guished guest they had received.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There had been a heavy trouble in
his native home during the young
man's absence. The child was well,
but the father, Robert Stephenson, had
met with an accident, by which he was
terribly scorched, and rendered totally
blind. In this great affliction, the
family helped the old man as well as
they could, but that was not much, and
of necessity some debts were incurred. It
took £18 out of his £28 to do this, and
soon after, he moved the aged couple
to a comfortable cottage near his own
dwelling, and supported them there
until the close of their lives.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One who was so dutiful to his own
parents, richly merited that his son
should be dutiful to him, and in all
his biography, whether literary or scien-
tific, there is nothing more truly noble
and beautiful than the perfect love
between George Stephenson and his
congenial-minded son. Not often is it
permitted for parent and child to be so
completely congenial in the character
of their minds as were these. Amid
all his trials and his triumphs, it must
have been his greatest earthly comfort
that his son shared his honourable
toils, and drank deeply into his own
spirit.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Very slow at this time was the outward
progress of our hero. He had not only
all those heavy kindred cares upon
him, but in 1807-8, he was drawn for
the militia, and the cost of procuring a
substitute swept away all his savings.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Many years after, when addressing a
society of young men at Belper, he
said "Not having served an apprentice-
ship to an engineer, I had made up my
mind to go to America, considering
that no one in England would trust
me to act as an engineer."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Between the years 1808-12, his first
skill as an engineer was put to the test.
A neighbouring coal-pit was drowned
with water, and the pumping engine
used, was wholly inefficient to draw
it off; after a long delay, the managers
agreed to let Stephenson try his hand
at improving the pumping engine; he
was completely successful, and a pre-
sent of ten guineas was made him
beyond his wages. His name was now
up through the country side, and he
was called to remedy the defects of
other engines. As usual, he varied
his toils by an ingenious employment
of his leisure. The housewives of the
district were indebted to him; for by
a simple contrivance, he made the
smoke-jacks at the chimney side rock
the cradles of the infants. He used
also to cut out men's suits of cloths
so dexterously, that "George Step-
henson's cut" is spoken of to this day;
meanwhile, his favourite occupations
of last making, and clock and watch
mending, went on, and filled up his
leisure—reading, writing, and above
all arithmetic not being forgotten.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}During these four years he saved
£100 in guineas; and during a demand
for gold, he sold his guineas for twenty-
five shillings each, and began to feel
his footing more secure in a worldly
sense, though his wages were still very
moderate. He was 31 years of age
before he obtained his regular em-
ployment as an engineer to a colliery,
at £100 a year.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of the strongest determinations
of Stephenson was that his son Robert
should have a good education. Ac-
cordingly he sent the boy to a good
school at Newcastle, where he proved
himself as diligent as even his active
father could wish. The youth's edu-
cation aided the further development
of his father's mind, for as Robert in
time attended the lectures at the New-
castle Literary Philosophical Society,
he was required to bring home an
abstract of what he heard, and few
more beautiful sights could be seen
than young Robert on a Saturday af-
ternoon, when he returned to his home
at Killingworth, giving his father an
account of scientific matters, or read-
ing with him some valuable scientific
book, or making drawings and experi-
ments. Both child and man were
carrying on their education.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The wooden tram-ways that ran in
front of the cottage where Stephenson
first saw the light, were of course the
means of suggesting the modern rail-
way, and the first locomotive or tra-
veling engine that Stephenson made
was simply a contrivance by which
coal waggons might be propelled along
the tram-ways with more speed and
less expense. His own account of the
matter is this. "The first locomotive
I made was at Killingworth colliery,
and with Lord Ravensworth's money.
Yes! Lord Ravensworth was the first
to trust me with money to make a lo-
comotive engine." That engine was
made in 1813, and Stephenson called
it "My Lord."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}He did not claim any inventive
power as to the locomotive. His men-
tal history is chiefly remarkable for
his aptitude at improving and apply-
ing what, but for his practical common
sense, might have only been scientific
curiosities. A man of wondrous gen-
ius in Cornwall, named Trevethie,
made a locomotive steam-engine to
travel on common roads, as for back
as 1802. But though marvellously
ingenious, there was such danger as-
sociated with this invention, that it
never found permanent favour or suc-
cess, and Richard Trevethie left a
name second to none as a man of gen-
ius, but he wanted what is as rare and
as valuable as genius—plodding, sound,
common sense. In these latter quali-
ties Stephenson excelled, and they
stood him in greater stead than the
loftiest genius without them.{{< /news/text >}}

America.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Mexican question is again the
chief subject of interest in the news
from America. The President had
laid the correspondence between his
government and France before Con-
gress, and it will be seen from the sub-
joined abstract of it that there is little
chance of agreement between the two
Powers. A telegraphic notice of this
correspondence appeared in our last:—-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In July last Maximilian's agent made
an unsuccessful attempt to obtain Fed-
eral recognition through the intermedi-
ary of M. de Montholon. On Novem-
ber 16th Mr. Seward wrote to Mr. Big-
elow, the American ambassador at
Paris, representing that the presence
and the operations of the French army
in Mexico, and its maintenance of an
authority there, caused serious concern
to the United States. Nevertheless
the objection of the United States is
still broader, and includes the author-
ity itself which the French army is
thus maintaining, and which is in di-
rect antagonism to the policy of the
Federal government and the principle
on which it is founded. Every-day's
experience of its operations confirms
the justice of the views expressed by
the Federal government at the time
that the attempt to institute that au-
thority first became known. The
United States still regard the attempt
to establish permanently a foreign im-
perial government in Mexico as disal-
lowable and impracticable, because the
United States could not now agree to
compromise the position heretofore
assumed. They are not prepared to
recognise, or pledge themselves hereaf-
ter to recognise, any political institu-
tions in Mexico in opposition to the
Republican government with which
they have so long maintained friendly
relations. He dwells so earnestly on
on this branch of the political relations
because at present they supersede those
of commerce in the consideration of
the American people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On November 30th, Mr. Bigelow re-
ports having read Mr. Seward's des-
patch to M. Drouyn de Lhuys, who
thanked him, though he felt obliged
to say that he derived neither pleasure
nor satisfaction from its contents.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On the 4th December, Mr. Seward
writes to Mr. Bigelow:-—"Your des-
patch of Nov. 24th seems to discourage
on our part expectations of an early
withdrawal of the French from Mexico.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It must be remembered, however,
that the opinions on that subject which
received from M. Drouyn de Lhuys
were expressed not only without the
emperor's positive sanction, but also
in the absence of any knowledge on
the part of the French government as
the definite conclusions of the Presi-
dent on the subject discussed. It is
desirable to leave no part of those op-
inions open to misapprehension. It is
signally desirable that we shall be au-
thorised to infer that such expositions
of imperial views as are given to us in
the name of the French government
are made with the emperor's approval."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On December 16th Mr. Seward writes
to Mr. Bigelow that it is the Presid-
ent's purpose that France should be
respectfully informed upon two points
—-first, that the United States earnestly
ship desire to cultivate sincere friend-
ship with France. Second, that this policy
would be imminently jeopardised un-
less France could deem it consistent with
her interest and honour to desist from
prosecuting armed intervention in Mex-
ico to overthrow the existing Republic
an government, and establish upon its
ruins a foreign monarchy. In conclu-
sion, Mr. Seward says that the United
States will not recognize Maximilian
even if the French troops are with-
drawn from Mexico.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The papers presented to Congress
include a confidential letter from M.
Drouyn de Lhuys to M. de Montholon,
the French ambassador at Washington.
dated October 18th stating that he re-
newed the assurance of the strong de-
sire of the French government to with-
draw its auxiliary corps as soon as cir-
cumstance permitted. The French
government has been ready to adopt,
without a moment's delay the basis of
an understanding with the Washing-
ton government. What it asked of
the United States was an assurance
that it was not their intention to im-
pede the consolidation of the new or-
der of things founded in Mexico. The
best guarantee the French government
could desire would be Federal recog-
nition of Maximilian.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}On December 6th Mr. Seward wrote
to M. de Montholon saying:—-"After
a review of all the facts, the President
is gratified with the assurance you
give of the emperor's good disposition.
I regret, however, to be obliged to
say that the condition which the em-
peror presents is one which seems to
be impracticable."-—Straits Times{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Emperor Maximilian has de-
livered a speech in reply to an ad-
dress offering condolence upon the
death of King Leopold, in which he
expressed confidence in his destiny,
and a determination to continue the
course which he has commenced. He
would not change the Democratic cus-
toms of Mexico, but he considered a
strong rule was the last anchor of safety
for the country. He looked forward
to the future without anxiety.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Ranchero, of Matamoras, states
that Bagdad was abandoned by the
Liberals on this 26th January, and
that a Federal guard was stationed
there. The Imperialists took posses-
sion the same day. Cortinas and Es-
cobedo had left the neighbourhood of
the Rio Grande. The leading mer-
chants of Matamoras, both foreign and
Mexican, have published a protest
against the proceedings of the Federal
civil and military authorities on the
Texas side of the Rio Grande, charg-
ing them with the responsibility of the
troubles and outrages perpetrated on
the Rio Grande by aiding the par-
tisans of Juarez—a party which they
declare has at present no more foot-
hold there than is afforded by Federal
officials. The Consuls of Great Bri-

{{< news/centre >}}
Our Buddhist Champion.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Our readers, we presume have not
forgotten the discussion we had in our
columns some two or three months
since with a distinguished Buddhist
Champion, and they may, perhaps, won-
der why they have heard nothing more
from him. We feel now constrained
to confess that this silence has not
been from any power we flattered our-
selves we had in silencing him by ar-
gument, but rather from an unwilling-
ness we have had to publish his
puerile effort. It was sent for publication
many weeks since, and we have thus
long laid it aside not by any means be-
cause we wanted time to study how
to answer it, but simply because we
feared our readers would not think it
worth the space it must needs
occupy in our small paper. We still
have the same fears, and hence have de-
termined now to make but a few brief
remarks concerning it. The article
possesses some interest as a specimen
of the utter weakness of Buddhism to
sustain any argument against the Bi-
ble. The writer instead of replying a
word to any of our answers to his pre-
vious objections, produces another
which he evidently thinks is a poser
and may well stand as his grand ulti-
matum. And what is wonderful about
it is, that he has taken it from that
good christian work for children—-
The Rollo Series, written by Rev. J.
Abbot of N. York. The chapter which
after all his re-search he has light-
ed upon is that one where Miss Mary
teaches Jonas, Rollo, and Lucy that
there is really no rainbow "set in the
clouds" or any where else, but that
"it is only an optical illusion in peo-
ples eyes." Our most highly distin-
guished Buddhist advocate having
quoted from the Bible all the passage
found in the 9th Chapter of Genesis con-
cerning the Rainbow, not copied what
Miss Mary taught concerning it, then
with an air of great triumph puts to
us the scoffing question, "Is this
the Book which you affirm to be the
greatest luminary in the world, and
which is going to enlighten the whole
earth, imparting to mankind the high-
est and best knowledge"? He then gives
us his own peculiar ultimatum—-saying
The Bible appears to some to be but a feeble
taper in its power to impart light, or
more properly as a single lucifer match.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now while we are glad to have a
fresh confirmation of what we well
knew before, that Buddhism is proving
herself by her mightiest Champion to be
utterly weak and puerile in argument
against the Bible and Christianity,
we cannot but deeply lament that such
a man in such a high place of power
and influence is so sadly deluded. When
we consider the tremendous respon-
sibility he assumes—-the millions of
precious souls he is leading to eternal
ruin with his own, we often times groan
out in anguish of spirit—-O that he were
wise—-that he would consider his latter
end—-that he would but be willing to
study the Bible with a docile spirit,
stripped of all pride of opinion, of all
self conceit, of all fear of finding some-
thing in that Blessed book of God to
disturb his repose in Buddhism and
to draw his heart into a love of its
teachings! Then would he most cer-
tainly find in it "the words of eternal
life" and by them with their author's
eternal power and grace be saved with
an everlasting salvation. It is not only
for his own soul and the millions he
is now leading that we fear, but also
for the future welfare of the Kingdom
which he causes to blaspheme the name
of the most High and only God our
Saviour, and to despise and even openly
ridicule the only and infallible Chart
God has given mankind to direct them
to eternal life. Jehovah's threatening
found in Isaiah LX. 12th looks as if
it were pointing directly to Siam in
her present prolonged and fearful
infidelity. "The nation and kingdom
that will not serve thee shall perish; yea
those nations shall be utterly wasted."
But while we thus frankly and affec-
tionately express our fears for Siam, we
do still entertain lively hopes that she
will yet be saved as a nation, and
finally greatly blest as a Christian
kingdom. But these hopes, we are
fully persuaded can only be realized by
speedy repentance on the part of those
who rule Siam; and for this we do
and will continue to hope even unto
death.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}object in uniting Siam at the present
time is to further the interests of
the British Telegraph Company in
carrying through their line from Maul-
main to Singapore with a branch from
Tavoy to this city.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}From a government document of
which we give a translation in one of
the columns of this issue, our readers
will rejoice to percieve that Siam is
not going to be behind any neighbor-
ing nation in allowing her territory to
be traversed by Telegraph lines.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nothing has occurred here for a long
time that has given us so much hope
for Siam as a nation as this noble de-
termination of her government to
allow herself to be put into lightening
communication with Western Asia
the isles of South Eastern Asia,
Australia and Europe. Mr. Reid be-
ing an old acquaintance of His Ma-
jesty's, a man of the most respectable
and powerful connections, will, we
doubt not, accomplish great good by
his present mission. The grand work
he has in hand has, we trust al-
ready advanced to a point from which
it cannot go backward. Within a year
or two at the farthest, we may boldly
predict, messages will be flashing be-
tween Bangkok and Maulmain and
Singapore daily; and as the great
western line from Europe is already
complete to Maulmain, we shall in
that time be on the most intimate
speaking terms with all Europe.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We learn also that Mr. Reid will at
the present time exert his influence in
bringing up for discussion before the
Siamese government the project of
having a railroad constructed between
this and Maulmain. This, at first
thought, may seem to some a too rapid
march in the line of improvement for
such a country as Siam. But on more
mature reflection, we think it will be
found not a wild project. Siam is
now loudly summoned by passing
events to come up promptly to the aid
of such projects as bid fair to unite
her closely and indissolubly with Bri-
tish interests. What possible danger
could there be to her interests in al-
lowing British capitalists to construct
a railroad from Maulmain to Bangkok?
How surely would such a road in suc-
cessful operation enhance the wealth
and glory of her great emporium?
How closely would it draw the ties of
intercourse and union between the
British nation and herself? If she
would maintain her independence for
ages to come, what other course can she
take half so likely to secure it as by
such a union? Hence though Americans
as we are, our hearts burn within us to
exert our little influence to induce Si-
am to cultivate the closest intimacy
with her western neighbor, and not only
invite England to come and aid her in
making the railroad and the telegraph
line above spoken of, but also to con-
struct a ship canal across the isthmus
of Kraw. This would give Siam a
glorious name to be transmitted on-
ward to the end of time.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A government document.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
A Translation.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}The statement that the Siamese
government have forbidden or hin-
dered the establishment of any telegra-
ph line is not correct. The Siamese
government has not opposed—has not
forbidden any one, or any company to
make such a line. There was a certain
party which extended to government
a written proposition to construct a
telegraph line from Paknam to Bang-
kok. There were two proposals made
in regard to it. One was that the
party should have the exclusive
right of making and using the line
for a period of 25 years—forbidding
every other party from making any
other line within that period,
that at the expiration of the 25 years
the party would sell all right and title
in the same to the Siamese government,
and that the government should be
under obligation to purchase it whether
it could be used or not. The other
proposition was that during all the
period of 25 years the Siamese govern-
ment should guarantee that no part of
the telegraph line should be lost, and
if lost that the government shall make
it good.
Now the Siamese government can-
not accept of either of these proposi-
tions. She cannot promise to forbid
other parties making tele graph lines;
because an English company has al-
ready made better propositions than
these. They have already entered upon
negotiations for connecting a tele-
graph line from Bengal and British
India with Mergue. From thence
they propose to stretch the line
through Siamese territory from Kroh
to Ranawng—and thence to Takooda
P'óóng—thence to Takǒǒda P'a,
and from thence to Keddah. From
Keddah they will make it to Pre—
thence to Sallingkaw, Malacca, and
Singapore. They intend to extend it
to Sumatra, Borneo, Batavia, Austra-
lia and China.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the territory of Siam they
propose to be at the whole expense of
the work and the protection of it after
it is finished. Whenever any of their
servants shall seize any Siamese sub-
ject found guilty of stealing or other-
wise damaging the line, they will hand
said offender over to the Siamese au-
thorities for trial according to
the laws of the province in which the
trespass has been committed. Said
company do not ask the Siamese gov-
ernment to forbid any other company
making a telegraph line, or ask her to
purchase their property after a certain
period, or to guarantee its security.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This proposal the Siamese govern-
ment has already received, and agreed
that whatever privileges the Malayan
provinces of Pre, Sallingkaw, Johore
and other Malayan countries shall grant
said company, the Siamese government
will do the same.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This line is a long one, and will
probably be of great advantage to the
country. The constructing of it is
not going to involve the Siamese gov-
ernment very much in any way. She
is to have no trouble or expense in ma-
king or keeping it in repair.—All she
will have to do will be to dispense jus-
tice to persons whom the company
shall hand over for that purpose. The
wire and glass of which the line is to
be made are such things as thieves will
be likely to steal. The country abounds
with men who make a business of steal-
ing bits of iron, as nails, wire &c. to
exchange the same for candies and
match paper. And they will even
steal bricks from the pavement, and
bamboos, and mangrove wood and
bark, and plank from bridges in bye
places. They will even pull out nails
from buildings in such places. Such
things they do often.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now the Telegraph lines wherever
made will be continually liable to such
depredations. And if the Siamese gov-
ernment should establish a guard along
the line it would be like putting chains
day and night about the necks of the
persons in charge who are now free.
This would occasion great difficulty
and trouble. In desolate places it
would be like putting chains about
the necks of the Siamese govern-
ment. And the government thus wait-
ing to protect the line for hire, might
not get any pay, and if perchance she
get pay, it would not be a suitable
compensation for all her trouble in
guaranteeing the security of the prop-
erty.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now if any company will undertake
to construct a telegraph line in Siam-
ese territory on the same terms as the
above, the Siamese government will
receive their proposition.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/text >}}Chow Phya Prǎ'k-lang, a royal
counsellor, and Minister for Foreign
affairs, to J. M. Hood Esq. Consul for
the United States of America.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir—I crave the honor of informing
you that I am in receipt of a letter
from Chow Phya P'ǒǒt'ǎra p'éi Sǎ-
mǒǒhǎ-nayok, who is in charge of the
taxes on houses, sheds, market-stalls,
boats, and floats, directing me to notify
all the resident consuls that the system
of taxation which the tax-farmers
have been authorized to follow in
collecting taxes from the people is
in a state of confusion with regard to
some of the smaller matters: while
the larger matters are working quite
acceptably. But there is a rubbing
and chafing in the operation of taxing
(the smaller vessels) because the taxes
formerly levied on larger vessels com-
ing from foreign lands to trade, as
square rigged vessels and Chins junks,
have been removed. And subsequent-
ly all carts were likewise exempted
from taxation because they come loaded
with merchandise from the jungles,
with articles that are taxed to increase
the government revenue. And again
persons coming in from the country
from whatever direction to work out
their taxes, beg that they may have the
privilege of loading their boats with
food and other provisions according to
their several necessities free from tax-
ation.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}[Hence] it is now the pleasure of His
Majesty the king to grant the people
of Siam the favor of freedom from
paying taxes on their small boats. But
all boats that trade from the Provin-
ces on the sea coast and from the rivers
(of the same) being freighted with
merchandise of various kinds going or
coming and thus causing the govern-
ment revenue to be increased, shall
still pay taxes as (formerly.){{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is now the pleasure of the king
to exempt from taxation such boats as
trade in the rivers, and that come from
the (inner) provinces—boats with masts
and sails, and small boats that are em-
ployed in the country. Taxes shall
be continued to be levied only on boats
that moor in the river and remain for a
time selling their goods from them
instead of having their goods sold from
regular market places and stalls—-using
their boats as stores much as the
floating houses are used, and boats laden
with brick and sand. As brick and
sand are not taxed, and houses, on land,
and houses on water, and market stalls,
and gambling sheds and places where
sundry merchandise is stored, govern-
ment begs the privilege of levying taxes
on all such boats and houses as from
the beginning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the old arrangement in regard
to sheds, market stalls, houses, and
floats in the range or neighborhood of
markets not employed in trading—-
interspersed among those that are ex-
empting such from taxation on the
score of their not being thus used, the
government now sees that they should
pay taxes equally with their neighbors,
because they occupy places in the mar-
ket that should be turned to account
for the support of government: but
their occupants refuse to employ them
for that purpose which is not right.
Hence it is proper that they should
be taxed and thus be obliged to con-
tribute their share in the business of the
market, that the country may be thus
benefited. And in regard to the mar-
ket which enjoys the benefit of a Police
force as a guard, it is proper that the
taxes on the buildings of the market
should be increased so as to pay the
expense of the Police force.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sir-—Having read an article in the
Bangkok Recorder the Siamese issue
under date of 17th March—-3rd No.
and 19th page, that four Chronometers
belonging to Europeans had lately been
stolen, and that two of the thieves had
been caught and the Siamese govern-
ment had not inflicted any punishment
upon them, we beg to insert in the
“Recorder” the following explana-
tion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the international Court there is
a case of stealing a Chronometer which
occurred in 3rd month the year of the
cow—-7th of the decade. Lóóbang
Oopǎtate-t’ooi-hán seized a woman
who was found engaged in selling a
watch chain. And made a written
complaint to Kroma Mun warǎ-chák
t’aranōōp’ǎp the purport of which was
that other watch chains and other goods
had been stolen: but there was no men-
tion of any watch or Chronometer in that
complaint. When the case was inves-
tigated it was found, after going back
from the person in whose hands the
chain was to the 5th person, that
had successively possessed it, that
Chant’a and K’ong servants of Lóóbang
Oopǎtate-t’ooi-hán had stolen it from
him and sold it. The court then directed
Lóóbang Oopǎtate to deliver over Chan-
t’a and K’ong his servants to the court.
Lóobang Oopâtate could hand over to the
only K'ong, and Chant'a he could
not deliver up. As to K'ong, he
gave in testimony that on a certain
day Lóóang Oopàtato and his wife
being asleep-—he saw Chant'a go up
stairs and come down again, when
Lóóang Oopàtato awoke and said that
his watch with a gold case was gone
together with its chain. When he
learned that K'ong had given in this
testimony he made another statement to
court with regard to the matter, say-
ing that his gold watch had also dis-
appeared with its chain. The court
then took the mother of Chant's into
custody in the place of her daughter
as they did also the person who
stood as security to the wife of Lóo-
ang Oopàtato for Chânt'a so that these
should exert their influence to bring
Chant'a before court. The court then
offered a reward of 40 ticals for the
person of Chant'a. Now so long as
the person Chant'a who was charged
with the theft could not be found for
trial, how could the court punish any
other persons who were afterwards
involved in the matter of purchasing
and selling the stolen goods?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again. In the 4 month 9th of the
waxing moon the year of the hog—5th
of decade, about two years ago Mr.
Mason, Consul for Denmark, made a
written complaint to us that a Chro-
nometer belonging to Captain Polain
was missing. Capt. Polain made en-
quiries and found that it was in the
possession of Capt. Smith of the ves-
sel Marion, and begged that the court
would have the matter investigated.
The lawyers made enquiries at the
vessel Marion, which was a vessel be-
longing to the company of Phya
Chodûk-rât-sât'ée, and sent orders to
Phya Chodûk to deliver up the Chro-
nometer together with the person who
sold it. Phya Chodûk returned an-
swer that he would comply with the
order. In two or three days after
that, the purchaser of the Chronometer
delivered the Chronometer to the D[?]nish
Consul. The Danish Consul then sent
the Chronometer with a letter to us
that we might examine it, and having
done so, to return the Chronometer so
him requesting that we would stay
all further proceedings. In that let-
ter of the Danish Consul there were
no charges against any one whether
Siamese or European, or any other
for purchasing the Chronometer as
stolen property. When the Danish
Consul requested by letter that the
prosecution might be stayed we thought
it probable that the thief was a Eu-
ropean, and that therefore the Danish
Consul was so ready to drop the mat-
ter. Had he not requested the prose-
cution to be stayed, it would have
been continued until the matter had
been thoroughly investigated according
to law.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the year of the rat—-5th of the de-
cade, Mr. Johnson had a Chinese ser-
vant-boy arrested and brought before
the International court. There was
a letter from the Dutch Consul to
Mãwm Rajoday-t'ei, stating that the
servant-boy had stolen a watch and
several other things. The court exa-
mined the boy but he would not con-
fess to any guilt. Mr. Johnson af-
firmed that there were persons that
would testify to his guilt, and that he
would bring them before court. But
he failed to do so, and hence the court
could not arrive at the truth of the
matter. Mãwm Rajoday-t'ei wrote to
the Dutch Consul requesting that he
would have Mr. Johnson appear be-
fore the court with his witnesses. But
he did not appear. Now in this case
not yet thoroughly tried, how could
punishment be inflicted upon the person
charged with'stealing the property?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The case which the Bangkok Re-
corder reports, that within the last 25
days a person went on board the ves-
sel Clio, and stole a Chronometer, has
not yet been reported to the Interna-
tional court. The court are hence of
opinion that the owner of the Chro-
nometer has not yet fixed upon the
person who stole it, and that to make
complaint of it under those circum-
stances would be labor lost. But it
is probable that the owner suspects
Siamese subjects of being concerned
in the theft. And hence the Bang-
kok Recorder has made the assertion
that the Siamese government is like a
machine that has become loose in a
vital part and consequently weak.
Now we beg to say in reply to that
assertion, that the government of Siam
is like a machine in good repair. But
steam engines go because of fire the
chief agent, and a watch goes because
of the key which winds it up. When
the fire is out, and the key lost, can the
steam engine or the watch go alone?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But the truth is the Siamese govern-
ment, even, is like a stout machine fixed
firmly in its place. And should there
be any little thing out of order we
have those who are skilled in making
all necessary repairs, so that there shall
be no failure in the administration of
justice.{{< /news/text >}}

Rocky Mountain Scenery.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}One peculiarity is the great abund-
ance of flowers. At the East, the
meadows, the forests, and the unculti-
vated fields, are comparatively destit-
ute of flowers. But they abound over
all the West, even to the shores of the
Pacific. When spring comes, flowers
in endless profusion, of almost every
variety, fresh and bright with striking
colors, adorn the prairies of the West,
and turn them into a wild panorama
of beauty. California becomes "the
flowery land;" and amidst the bar-
renness, sage-brush and "perpetual
desolations" of the central "plains"
where nearly all vegetation fails, these
flowers assert their right to live, and
even now, in a physical sense, make
the desert bud and blossom like the
rose.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}So they sweep over and over
the mountains, springing up from slopes
of broken stone, festooning and over-
hanging lofty cliffs, peeping out of
crevices, hanging on to the least amount
of vegetable mold on the almost per-
pendicular rock, covering its ragged-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}monotones and sameness, or carpeting a whole
mountain side with ever-varying pat-
terns, in some of which one color pre-
dominates, and some another, some
coarse and large, and others very deli-
cate and beautiful, but in the aggre-
gate embracing a wonderful variety.
There seems no exuberance of floral
wealth and beauty, as if in mockery for
any who vainly might strive to cul-
tivate there any of the ordinary forms
of vegetation. It is also asserted that,
by the wonderful law of acclimation by
which men and beasts accustom them-
selves to altitudes and conditions of
climate that seem unnatural, these
most fragile forms of vegetable life
attain an uncommon hardihood, and
flourish on the mountains within de-
grees of temperature that would prove
fatal to them elsewhere. Plants that
we would gladly possess ourselves of,
by the tenderest care and culture, spring
up through banks of snow, and dot its
cold and colorless surface with sweet
flowers. Small wild fruits, like rasp-
berries, flourish and abound at an
altitude of nearly two miles. I remem-
ber toiling laboriously up a mountain
to a mining town. where the air was so
rarified that breathing and the action
of the heart were very much affected
by it, and where we seemed to be well
up with the snow-line lying on the
mountain over against us, and were
told by some Christain ladies that the
only way to keep up a Sunday school
through the summer in that place was
to have it at 8 o'clock in the morning;
for if the children once got out among
the raspberries, they could not gather
them together again, or at any later
hour!{{< /news/text >}}

The Triumph of Ideas.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
(Spectator.)
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is hard even for trained thinkers
intent upon their work to explain pre-
cisely why a true idea always wins—-
except indeed by saying what to-day
is an argument only with the Record,
and the Record's bitterest antagonist,
that the Judge of all the earth can do
only right, and that He is irresistible—-
but the fact remains. Great ideas have
strength. Let the strongest man in
Europe try a fall with the Emperor
Napoleon and he will be beaten, will
possibly end his days rowing about under
the lash through the bayous of Cayenne.
Nevertheless, as sure as the idea of
authority, so surely will Napoleonism
pass away, leaving only the trace a
beacon light leaves when it flashes on
a quagmire or a rock. Nothing on
earth at this moment seems so invincible
as English pauperism. It is pro-
tected by the faith of the strongest
people that ever lived, by the impreg-
nable earth wall of human ignorance,
by a wretched perversion of the word
of the Son of God, and it will fall never-
theless, fall till its defence will seem, not
to our "sons" or our posterity, but to
us, a momentary aberration which
volumes will be written to explain.
Ideas are stronger than armies, for they
can not only produce armies, as the
idea which led to the Crusades did, but
they can borrow armies, as the idea
which produced Abolition did, and as
the idea which demands justice in
Jamaica will do. Those good Tories
think they have a majority upon that
question, which is really an "idea,"—the
right of the British subject with pigment
in his cuticle to the same measure as
the British subject without pigment—-
and their view, though an improbable
one, is of course a possible one. What
then? The Sadducees may say the true
policy is to see that the people of
Jamaica are oppressed, and be silent
lest there should be a fuss about it,
and uncultivated people say things pleas-
ing to the Almighty but not to Oxford,
and the Sadducees will be for their
ends in the right. And the idea will
march on nevertheless, till it meets
some day, and at no long day, the
flesh, beautiful or hideous, which will
clothe it with the required physical
power, and the Sadducees will cower
first of all, and acknowledge, "Lo! here
is Truth armed." Fighting her is not
my business, but concession. Why
fight with expediencies which have be-
come strong? Whence the flesh is to
come from we know not, possibly from
some low greed for gain which only the
negro can secure to us, but come it
will at last, and then the idea clothed
and visible will rule with the tyrannical
sway which all Anglo-Saxon ideas as-
sume. Meanwhile it is well for the
few who have not lost the capacity for
intellectual faith to march on, carrying
their idea over an ever widening range
until at last the body is found, careless of
those who satirise them as fanatics,
dangerous to those who denounce them
as evil men, firm even against those
who, seeing as clearly as themselves,
will lend no hand to help because the
workmen reak so with their toil. Was
ever enthusiast, yet so silly a she who
first put a seed into the ground and
expected the rotten mite to grow!{{< /news/text >}}

The Central Africans.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}At a missionary meeting lay latley
held in England, Dr. Livingstone, the
African explorer, said:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I should like to answer a question
that is often put to me, "What sort of
people are those you wander among?"{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now I should like to tell you that
they are very far from being savages.
On the sea coast they are rather blood-
thirsty, especially those who have been
in the slave trade, but when you get
about three hundred miles into the in-
terior, you meet with peop'e who are
mild and hospitable.—It is the duty
of each man in the village to give ev-
ery stranger his supper, and to shew
him every hospitality which lies in his
power. These people are not engag-
ed in hunting, as most inhabitants
of this country think they are, but
are employed in cultivating the soil.
They also manufacture iron, smelting
it from stone, and very excellent iron
it is.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I brought home with me the last
time I was in England some of the ore,
and the iron was manufactured into an
excellent Enfield rifle. The quality
was exceedingly good, and equal to
the best Swedish iron.—They also
manufacture a superior quality of cop-
per, also articles of earthen ware and
basket-work.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When we first go among this class
of people, with the idea of their being
savages, it is rather singular, but I be-
lieve true, that they rather believe we
are savages. They do not understand
where all the black people who are
carried away go to. Thousands are
taken away annually, and you cannot
go any where without meeting with
slave parties. Men carry what are
called slave-sticks, with a fork at the
end of them, which are fastened a-
round the necks of the captives, so
that it is impossible for them to get
out of there or get at the other end,
by which they are tied to trees through-
out the night.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The people I am now speaking of
imagine that the white people eat them.
They look upon us as cannibals, and
we look upon them as savages. Now,
if we take an impartial view of both,
we shall find that they are better than
each imagine one another to be.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
The Pulpit in India.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is lying before us an article
from a Lahore paper, which, after de-
nouncing the sermons preached in the
Panjab pulpits, proceeds to inform its
readers that very little good is done
by the whole body of Indian chaplains.
If this be the case, it might be as well
seriously to discuss the question, how
best to get rid of the ecclesiastical es-
tablishment. * * * * * * *{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In supposing all to be true that dis-
interested people have to offer about
chaplains, we may be permitted to
question whether it is not slightly un-
fair to lay the omissions of a few at the
door of all. At the same time it is
open to enquiry whether there is not
some cause for the want of popularity
(we can find no better word) of this
body of men. In such an enquiry,
however, it must not be forgotten that
the chaplain is a paid servant of Gov-
ernment, that the people who discuss
his failings are not those who in any
way contribute to his necessities. If
he tries their patience he is not a tax
upon their pockets. His tithe and his
glebe, his fees and his pew rents and
Easter offerings, are all of them con-
tained in his Government salary of Rs.
500 or 800 a month. Those desider-
rata clericalia, moreover, which in
England sometimes take the form of
purses of gold, services of plate, rich
silk gowns, and cassocks, and occasion-
ally descend even to worsted-worked
slippers, are, as we believe, completely
unknown in India. When once the
Junior chaplain on Rs. 500 a month,
has become a Senior on Rs. 800 a
month, he has got all that even a 25
years' service in the country can give
him. No amount of energy, no su-
perior learning, no tact, no eloquence,
no number of children, will enable this
clerical machine to make up more than
Rs. 500 a month for the first twelve,
and Rs. 800 a month for the last thir-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}teen years of his Indian service. Whe-
ther a better system than this could
be devised for damping and extinguish-
ing any fire of zeal, or fervour of elo-
quence, or sparks of ambition the un-
happy man may have, is doubtful.
Conceive the commissioned officers of
the army being divided into captains
on Rs. 500 a month, and majors on
Rs. 800; with no staff appointments,
no higher grades to rise to during a
25 years' service; after which term
they are sent about their business with
a pension, that, if they have a family,
comfortably keeps them from starva-
tion—-could anybody expect a very
high state of efficiency in such a set of
officers? Of course clergymen are not
officers; then unfortunately they are
men; and (such is the infirmity of
human nature) men of a very superior
class will not spend the cream of their
lives in India for the pay of a Gov-
ernment Chaplain. It is prosaic and
and perhaps humiliating to take this
view of clerical work, but is it not a
true view? A clergyman is supposed
by many a layman, who is clothed in
purple, to be above all thought of "fil-
thy lucre;" to work only and always
from the highest motives and on the
lowest pay; to care not one button
how his wife is dressed, or how his
children are educated. But we can-
not help reminding those of the En-
glish Church who take this view, that,
as they enjoy the advantages of a mar-
ried as well as educated clergy, they
must take the disadvantages as well.
In England the poorer clergy have
hope to live on the hope of some day
obtaining preferment, if they can com-
mend themselves to their Bishop, or
have any thing in them; and mean-
while they take pupils, or dabble in
the wide field of letters, or sometimes
are half starved. Yet the very uncer-
tainty of preferment permits them to
hope that something will turn up in
their favor. In India, while Govern-
ment has no doubt given its chaplains
a fair competence during the 25 years
of their lives, it has done nothing more.
It has virtually closed the door of the
three Bishoprics to their ambition; it
has cut off their Doddingtons and
Stanhope.{{< /news/text >}}

si magna licet componere parvis.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the two better paid Presidency
Chaplaincies; by its short-sighted par-
simony it is now denying to its older
servants the pension to which it has
declared them honorably entitled; and
bids all that are still in its employ, to
rest and be thankful on Rs. 800 a
month, as the ne plus ultra of a 25
years' residence in India. Were In-
dian chaplains Apostles; had none of
them families; or were all of them of
independent means, the system might
work well enough. But, as it is, to
expect extraordinary excellence with
such very ordinary payment, is in this
country ridiculous.-—Friend of India.{{< /news/text >}}

Gentlemen.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Perhaps these are rarer personages
than some of us think for. Which of
us can point out many such in his cir-
cle? Men whose aims are generous,
whose truth is constant, and not only
constant in kind, but elevated in de-
gree; whose want of meanness makes
them simple; who can look the world
honestly in the face, with an equal,
manly sympathy for the great and
small? We all know an hundred
whose coats are very well made, and
a score who have excellent manners,
and one or two who are what they call
in the inner circles, and have shot in-
to the very center and bull's eye of
fashion; but of gentlemen how many?
Let us take a scrap of paper and each
make out a list.—Thackeray.{{< /news/text >}}

What is the Test Oath
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The often-mentioned test oath which
Congress imposes on all its members,
and which is quite too large for nine-
tenths of the Southern elect to swallow,
reads as follows:{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I, A. B., do solemnly swear (or af-
firm) that I have never voluntarily
borne arms against the Government
of the United States since I have been
a citizen thereof, that I have volun-

sel or encouragement to persons en-
gaged in armed hostility thereto; that
I have never sought nor accepted nor
attempted to exercise the functions of
any office whatever under any author-
ity or pretended authority in hostility
to the Government of the United States;
that I have never voluntarily renoun-
ced my allegiance to the United States,
nor yielded voluntary support to any
pretended Government, authority,
power or constitution hostile or in-
imical thereto. And I do farther
swear (or affirm) that to the best of
my knowledge and ability, I will sup-
port and defend the Constitution and
Government of the United States, and
all laws made in pursuance thereof
against all enemies, foreign and domes-
tic; that I will bear true and faithful
allegiance to the same; that I take this
obligation freely, without any mental
reservation or purpose of evasion; that
I will well and faithfully discharge
the duties of the office which I am
about to enter, so help me God.{{< /news/text >}}

The late thunder storm.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}ACCUSTOMED as Singapore is to thun-
der storms, we question if ever before
since it came into European occupa-
tion it experienced such an electric
storm as raged yesterday between the
hours of eleven and twelve. Dense
masses of heavy rain clouds had been
gathering over the town for some hours
previously, and about half past ten
burst into a perfect torrent of rain
which the roofs of very few buildings
indeed could perfectly resist. The
streets were quickly flooded, and in
the suburbs for hours afterwards many
the suburbs for hours afterwards many
of the roads were submerged. About
half an hour after the rain commenced,
het first thunder pell was heard, so
loud and so sudden as to startle every
one. From this true flash succeeded
flash, and the thunder pealed with
scarcely any intermission, with deafen-
ing loudness, for over an hour, when
the storm appears to have spent itself;
though, unfortunately, its traces remain,
both in loss of life and property. As
will be learned from other paragraphs,
several vessels have had their spars
split, and many houses, we are in-
formed, have had their structure more
or less shaken. As far as we have
learned up to the present, five lives
have perished by the lightning.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}One of a row of new buildings in
progress of erection in Queen street
was struck by the fluid, and the upper
portion of the side wall, toppling over,
fell upon the roof of the adjoining
house (No. 20 occupied by Manuel
Beins, a clerk in the Chief Engineer's
Office,) crushing through the roof and
upper floor of the building, and bury-
ing Mrs. Beins and her little brother
(a child of 3 years) who were endea-
vouring to escape from the house. As-
sistance was promptly rendered by the
neighbours, and they were quickly
exhumed; but too late Life was ex-
tinct. The house was most flimsily
constructed, one end of the rafters sup-
porting the second floor resting merely
on a rotten looking horizontal beam
extending the whole depth of the build-
ing, but the weight of bricks and tiles
was not sufficient to have broken
through had the floor been properly
supported. As it was, according to
the evidence of an eye witness, the
floor gave way gradually, and had not
Mrs. Beins been stupefied by fear she
might have escaped with life. An in-
quest was held, when a verdict of ac-
cidental death was given.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The third victim was a Chinese,
named Lim Chean, who had been in
the habit of keeping a stall, selling sea
weed and sugar cane near the red
light. He was struck dead by the light-
ning whilst taking shelter under one of
the large trees bordering the Esplanade.
He was marked along one side of the
body, and death was instantaneous.
He was taken to the Government dead
house, and an inquest was held on his
body at the hospital at 5 P.M., when a
verdict was returned, of accidental
death. The two other victims are
reported to be Klings who were struck
down while on board a Tongkang in
Harbour, but the particulars of their
case have not yet reached us.{{< /news/text >}}
