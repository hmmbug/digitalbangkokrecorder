FOR THE BANGKOK RECORDER.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}In a former article I incidentally refered
to the oil regions in some parts of the
United States, and suggested that oil might
possibly he found in Siam, but by doing
so I have apparently got myself into a
difficulty; for it seems to be taken for
granted by those in authority, that I ought
also to be able to point out exactly where
oil may be found. This however is much
more than I bargained for, and is far
beyond my ability.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}When I left the United States the oil
business was in its infancy, and I have
never had the pleasure of visiting the oil
regions. It will be perceived therefore,
that my knowledge of those regions, except
so far as received through newspapers is
rather limited.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It appears that Petroleum was first col-
lected in those regions, in small quantities,
as it oozed from the crevices of the rocks.
Sometimes it was found floating upon the
surface of the water, and lifted with a com-
mon skimmer, or with a wooden cloth,
which was laid upon the water, and when
it became saturated with oil, it was rung
out into a vessel Holes were also dug in
the sand on the edge of the rivers, and
when filled with water, the oil was collected
from the surface.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The idea was then conceived of sinking
wells in these neighborhoods, which has
proved eminently successful. In regard to
the external appearance of the oil regions
in Virginia. I quote from a correspondent
of the New York papers, "This is indeed
a remarkable region. Although of rough
exterior it presents inexhaustible fountains
of wealth within. Every where around
me are unmistakable evidence of the vast
wealth, which lies so long rotted beneath.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}these rugged hills, and sharply defined
valleys. Nature has indeed been bountiful
in this particular region. She has scattered
her treasures with a large and prodigal
hand. These wild lands which a few years
ago, were considered comparatively worth-
less, so much so indeed, that the more
acres a man possessed, the poorer he con-
sidered himself, are now at fabulous prices.
Wildly distorted strata, and impenetrable
forests, now command the prices of gold-
bearing quartz, and forests of rosewood."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It will also be perceived that Petroleum
is no new thing, but has only been discov-
ered in larger quantities, and applied to
different purposes. Upon this point I also
quote from the correspondence of another
New York paper.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"The name Petroleum means Rock Oil.
This indicates its place in the earth. True,
it flows from the earth, sometimes floats on
ponds or lakes, comes out in springs, is
found in some rocks, and is distilled from
bituminous coal. It used to be collected
on Seneca Lake, and was called Seneca oil.
The writer has some which was taken from
that Lake more than fifty years ago, and is
precisely like that from the oil regions of
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and other States.
Yet it is not a new thing—for it was
known and used on the Eastern Continent
before the Christian era. It has excited
new interest from its abundance and from
its new and extensive uses. Its exportation
from our country is prodigious, a real era
in the trade.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Petroleum is a real chemical compound,
formed of carbon and hydrogen, or a true
hydro-carbon. Several compounds of these
two elements exist together in it. Its con-
version by heat into illuminating gas is
well known. This is a gaseous hydro-car-
bon; Petroleum is a liquid hydro-carbon,
as is naptha also; and bitumen is a solid
hydro-carbon. Such vast quantities flow
from the oil wells that people cannot but
inquire, How is it produced? Though
chemists and geologists of high character
for knowledge, believe this oil results from
chemical action, upon either vegetable or
animal matter buried in the earth, or upon
both, they have not shown its production,
or what it the matter acted on, and how
the action is carried on. All agree that it
seems to be connected with coal fields,
where were imbedded immense quantities
of vegetable substances."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The annual products of the oil regions
have within the last four years become al-
most marvellous. The great iron, and
coal mines of Pennsylvania, produce annu-
ally about $51,000,000. The gold regions
of California, in her palmiest days, only
gave to commerce about $50,000,000, but
the oil regions of Pennsylvania and Vir-
ginia, although embracing but a small ex-
tent of territory, surpasses either of the
above by at least $5,000,000.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Oil has also been discovered in Southern
Ohio, in New York, and in Canada. A
productive well has also been found within
a league of the city of Mexico, and produces
oil so pure, that all the refining it needs, is
to be strained through a cloth. The New
Emperor Maximilian therefore, whatever
else he may need, will not want for oil.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}As to the true nature of the oil wells of
Burmah, we have not been correctly in-
formed. It is said however that they have
been yielding bountifully for some years,
but how long they would stand steam
pumping, as some of the wells in the
United States are pumped, it would be
difficult to tell. We presume however
that the oil of Burmah is the same as that
in the United States, and we see no reason
why it may not yet be found in Siam.{{< /news/text >}}

THE CITY OF DREAMS.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
FOR THE BANGKOK RECORDER
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}Could we move forward the wheels of
time a century, I fancy a journey to the
Lao country would be far different from
what it is now. The account of it then,
might run somewhat as follows. "Took
the morning train from Bangkok, and after
a delightful ride up the banks of the Menam
we dined at Nakawn-Sawan, and. stopped at
Rahang. Then taking a sleeping car in the
night train, we found ourselves in the morn-
ing after a pleasant night's rest at Chieng
Mai."{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With the improvements going on in the
other portions of the world and even in
Siam, we may not say that this is either
impossible or improbable. Should the dream
of the fancy ever prove a reality, it will be a
very agreeable one to those who will have
the journey to make. Such a one would,
I have no doubt, compare very favorably in
ease and comfort, as well as speed, if not in
romance, with the ones taken in the "Matri-
monial" when newly fitted up for the oc
casion.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But in the absence of the carriage train
drawn by the "Iron horse" with lightning
speed, the Matrimonial was probably about
as good a substitute as we could have had.
Its bottom being very flat and its draught
consequently light, it can make its way
among the innumerable shallows of the river,
as it widens instead of contracts in some
portions of its upward course, where few
other boats of its capacity can navigate. Its
motion too is so steady that you are not
always fearful that some unavoidable change
of position will destroy the centre of gravity
and give serious apprehensions of an im-
promptu bath. The first tour that I made
in Siam, was in a run yuan whose motions
were as hidden as those of a Scotch terrier,
and harder to be calculated for beforehand
than were the freaks of the great Scottish
theologian's horse. But to my narrative.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After a hurried preparation I started in
company with a missionary friend on the
20th of November, 1863. The current
against which we had to make headway at
that season of the year was exceedingly
strong, thus rendering our progress corres-
pondingly slow.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}With the exception of a little variety,
made by passing successive]y the towns of
Angtawng, Prome In, Chainat, and Ma-
norom, and a beautiful view of the setting
sun from the summit of Mount Terrama-
moon, and some large birds which our fowl-
ing piece obtained, we had but little to
break up the monotony of the way as far
as Nakawn-Sawan. The high banks on
which it is situated led us to hope that we
would soon have more variety in the scenery
along the river. In this, however, we were
disappointed, as the banks are so low and
the country so flat about Kamp'eng P'et,
and thence towards Rahaang, as they are
about Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}After taking the left fork at Nakawn-Sa
wan, the ground was comparatively new to
foreigners. Besides Sir Robert Schomburgh
and his party, we knew of only a few others
who had preceded us. It was here that the
novelty of our trip began. As yet our oars
had been sufficient to propel our boat. But
on entering the Rahaang fork it refused to
go forward when all the boatmen had laid
on a "heavy hand," For several minutes no
perceptible progress was made except a
little like the Irishman's, backwards. We
neared the right bank a little, in order to
prepare our poles, which we had takes the
precaution to procure. There are bamboos
about twenty feet in length, with an iron
fork on the end. The water was rushing
by with fearful rapidity. After a few mo-
ments rest, we started off on our new ex-
periment. But our men made awkward
work of it for awhile, and the boat refused
to heed the new power brought to bear on it.
Hoping to improve s little we made for the
opposite bank, but drifted considerably in
crossing. If any thing it was worse there.
We found we were drifting rapidly down
the stream, when we seized the bushes and
trees on the shore, to see what distance
we had made. In short we seemed to be
completely nonplused. Was there an in-
superable barrier between us and Chieng-
Mai! We looked blank at each other for
a few moments, and laughed at our new
misfortunes. But what had been done.
could be done again. So after we had
chowed, and rowed, and pulled and pushed
and poled, we despatched a man on shore
with a long rope to tow us ont of our diffi-
culty. Just then too we were informed for
our encouragement by one who professed to
know the road, that it would reach Rahaang
in a month, and as for Chieng-Mai, that
was in the distant future. But our last exper-
iment succeeded, and after about three hours
of hard work, we turned a point but little
more than a half mile from our starting
place, and were pleased to find but few
places where the current was so strong as
just at the fork.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I have purposely dwelt longer on this
point than it might otherwise seem to
deserve, as a correct understanding of this
river and its freaks, were it possible, would
he one of the best preparations for this trip.
But it would be he difficult for one who
had newer traveled it, to understand its
capricious pranks, as it is for one who had,
to forget them.  We were often reminded
of the expressive description of it that—
who had been up before us, gave, "that it
was certainly a very peculiar river" Its bot-
tom is a bed of everchanging sand. This
sand keeps the water continually turbid, and
it is ever boiling up, as if from innumerable
whirlpools. It means continually seeking
but never finding a permanent resting place,
and the constant changes of its particles
changes the channel of the river. Following
what had recently been its bed, one side of
the boat runs against a sand bar, putting
your pole down on the other side you find
no bottom! Your only chance then, is to
drift off and make for the opposite side of
the river, but there you are at the mercy of
a merciless current, which leads you often
a quarter of a mile or more farther back.
This is an invariable process that must be
repeated at every bend. But still by dint
of perseverance we made good progress.
In two days and a half, we reached Muang
Ban Pot, and began to have intimations
that Kamp'aang Phet, could be made in a few
more. It was on a Saturday evening when
it began to appear, as the mountains which
had been before us, near which we thought
it was situated, disappeared. We spent
the Sabbath in the town, which has several
thousand inhabitants. We had a great
many visitors who came from curiosity, as
well as to receive books, of which we dis-
tributed a great number. Leaving there on
Monday morning we were led to hope that
Rahaang the first terminus of our voyage,
where we were to leave our boat, would be
seen in three days more. The river is there
divided up into many channels made by
little islands, amid which we had to snake
our way as best we could. Our men by this
time have become a little better accquainted
with the changes, and can calculate some-
what where the next bend will leave the
channel. With the exceptions of the islands
and a few little hills, one of which rising just
from the water, resembles some of our Phet-
chaburee mountains, we had but little change
of scenery all the way. The first portion
of the way from Nakawn Sawan, our course
was more North than West. The latter
portion was nearly N. West. Wednesday
night found us in sight of our long looked
for stopping place, though we did not reach
there till the afternoon of Thursday, being
the twenty seventh day, (Sunday's except-
ed) from Bangkok. Here you must leave
us for the present to make preparations for
our overland route thence to Chiang-Mai.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
FOR THE BANGKOK RECORDER.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
A PLEA FOR THE PEOPLE.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}This seems to be a wonderful day in the
history of our adopted country—or perhaps
more properly a day of wonderful things.
The long sleep—the unbroken lethargy
under which Siam has so long been resting
seems quite at an end. Thought is waking
up—-the people are becoming reative and
are beginning to doubt and question con-
cerning some things which for centuries
have been more firmly established, if pos-
sible, than "the laws of the Medes and
Persians.” With the more intelligent part
of the people, there is an almost painful
thirsting for a change of some kind——
whether it is their habits of life, their cus-
toms of society or their Religion—they,
themselves appear undecided ; but smooth
as the surface may appear to the careless
observer, the more attentive cannot but
decide that the waters beneath are greatly
troubled and that this is a period in the
history of the country pregnant with great
results. What these results shall be is a
question which should be carefully con-
sidered by every educated man and parti-
cularly by every philanthropist in the
country.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}I almost imagine that the King himself
must sit rather uneasily on his throne, at
times, when he stops to consider the
changes that are going on daily around
him. "His great ship of state" glided
smoothly and steadily along while the
custom of former ages was its only chart—
the Buddhist Religion, its guiding star and
His Majesty's sovereign will its compass.
But a new sea has opened up before him,
and shoals and reefs and breakers are
there, which were entirely unknown to that
old chart—the present surroundings are
vastly different from what they were a half
a century ago, and His Majesty must feel,
that to sail safely and happily, his chart
must be "revised and improved"—his
polar star must be carefully examined to
be sure that it is the true one, and his
compass must be brushed and polished,
and its magnetic needle guarded with
daily and hourly care, lest possibly its
polarity may be affected by outside
influences, and the great good of the ship
be sacrificed to other less important ends.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A commerce has been opened up between
this and the other nations of the earth, and
now the reigning monarch of Siam, must
not only be a "father to his own people,"
but he must be a step Father to all the
world beside ; and perhaps no monarch on
the face of the earth, needs more wisdom
to guide, and more strength of character
to execute, that which his wisdom may see
to be best in all cases, than the present
King of Siam. With a limited knowledge
of Foreign Languages and customs, he is
expected to "become all things to all
men"—he is expected to guard against
the smallest offence in his intercourse
with men, as well as to guard against the
great breaches of national etiquette, which
other nations—he is expected to give heed
to all the fulsome flattery of the selfish
sycophant, as well as, to the wise and
honest hints of true friends for the good
of the country. It may safely be presumed
that the future greatness of Siam, will be
much affected by a few years just now, but
she is taking her position, and becoming
known among the nations of the earth;
and what that position is to be, is future.
His Majesty's friends and advisers at pres-
ent, can hardly be small: aids in deciding.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Then, just at this crisis, where are the
real friends of the country? Where are His
Majesty's "friends tried and true" who are
willing to take up the people's cause, and
lay out their strength for the people's wel-
fare and help them, at once, to rise in
civilization and become known as an in-
dustrious and energetic people?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Post-offices, Telegraphs, Rail-roads and
Light houses are all good things, and their
introduction into the country will be hailed
with pleasure by every one interested in
the country's prosperity; they will add
much to the pleasure, ease and convenience
of the "Foreign Residents" in Siam, but
will any one of them, or will they all put
together, be worth one single farthing, as
far as either the mental or moral elevation
of the people is concerned! No! the people
need a different kind of improvements.—
They need a good permanent “Savings
Bank” where every man who chooses
may deposit his fuang, salung or tical per
week, and feel assured that it is safe there
for him against a time of want.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They need an Agricultural society with
the stimulant of Fairs, premiums &c. &c.
They need a Temperance society, with its
meetings, speeches, banners &c. &c. all of
which would be wholesome recreations and
pastimes; and they need good schools,
good school-books and a good newspaper
in their own Language.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There are those who will say that this
is all visionary and that the writer is an
enthusiast and dreamer—that the time for
these things has not yet come in Siam.
Well, Be it so. We have two newspapers
now, and even dreamers may tell their
dreams, and the enthusiast his wild con-
jectures. A year ago, the sceptical said
that the time had not yet come for news-
papers in Siam, but see, how they were
mistaken! Every thing must have a be-
ginning, and sometimes a very small and
discouraging beginning it has; but is that a
good reason why earnest, sensible men
should be still, and let Siam take her posi-
tion and become known among the nations
of the earth, in its present degraded condi-
tion! Today, is always the best time to
make a good work and here is no La-
fayette to come to the help of suffering
Siam! The King shows a commendable
willingness to adopt whatever he believes
to be for the good of his people, then who
will take up the subject of Savings' Bank,
and lay it in all its importance, before the
King and Officials of Government! Some
one should do this, who understands the
internal machinery of such an Institution,
and who could not only show its importance
and advantages, but could also explain the
necessary charter, Laws, regulations, &c.;
and this not in the English Langrage,
which is but imperfectly understood, but
in their own.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Why is it that there is so great a pro-
portion of this people mere idlers, gamblers
and drunkards! Simply and solely be-
cause they have no inducement to work.
The great wonder is that so many work,
rather than that there are so many idlers.
In a country like this, it is an easy thing
to get enough to eat, and why should a
man wish to make any thing more!—If he
has a master—his master will be sure to
manage in some way, to get any extra
change that he may make—if he has no
master, his dearest and best friend will
borrow it for just a few days, when both
parties ought to know that it will never be
paid;—if he tries to put it away in his
own possession, there is nothing much
more certain than that it will be stolen, so
the quickest way to save all farther trouble
is to enjoy it in opium smoking, drinking,
gambling or cock-fighting! But let a good
permanent Saving’s Bank, for the people,
be established by the authority of the King
and nobles, and let them encourage the
people, to put their little savings away in
it, and let the people feel assnred that it is
not only their safe, but on a yearly increase
and that no one but themselves, or those
with authority from themselves, can draw
it, and could not a single year tell of great
results among the people?{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Has "The Bangkok Recorder" not a
"right hand man" who will take this mat-
ter into consideration and see what can be
done "for the people." And when he suc-
ceeds in turning the channel of this stream
—that is in taking these savings out of the
drinking and gambling shops, and putting
them into a Bank, and thus encouraging
industry, sobriety and economy, his name
will deserve a far higher place in the his-
tory of Siam, than the name of Napoleon
in that of France, or of Washington in that
of America.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A TRANSLATION.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The names of Temples, villages and cities,
in the Kingdom of Siam, are derived from
three sources viz- Sanskrit, Siamese and
Cambodian. The names which the people
generally use, are spoken according to the
idiom of the Siamese language, and are short
and easily spoken; but the names used in the
Court language, that is in Government do-
cuments, which receive the Government
sea, are generally of Sanskrit derivation,
and apt to be be long: even though the San-
skrit names are in full length, the people
are prone to speak them incorrectly.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Some Cities and Temples have two and
often three names, being the ancient and
modern names, as they are used in the
Court language, or that of the people.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The present city of Bangkok, was form-
erly a chief Province of Siam, called Ton-
buree, a Sanscrit name. When written
according to the teacher of Sanskrit, in the
Roman character, Dhanapuri, but if writ-
ten according to the Siamese sound, it could
not be well read. This is the name used in
all the Royal documents, but in common
parlance it is called Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Sometimes the Sanskrit name for Bang-
kok is abridged, and made to compete with
the name of the Province of Non, by which
it is bounded on the North.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Province of Non, if it be called ac-
cording to Court language, would be Nant'a-
buree written according to Sanskrit, and it
Romanized, according to the teacher of
Romanizing, it would be Nondapuri; but if
written in full it would be Nont'buri Sri
Maha S.mudd: and the Sanskrit name of
Bangkok written in full would be Dhana-
puri Sri Maha Samudd, but the common
people universally call the former province
Talat K'wan, and the latter Bangkok; while
the class a little more elevated call the
former Non, and the latter T'on.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It is only in Court language, and in Royal
documents, that the names are written in
full, which could not be well used in com-
mon parlance.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the present city of Bangkok, in an-
cient times from the site of the palace of
the second King, down to the site of the
palace of H. R. H. Krom Hluang Wongsa,
there was no river,—it was a level field. The
river turned to the right, opposite the pe-
lace of the second King, and flowed in the
present channel of the Bangkok-Noi, sweep-
ing round to the westward towards the
temple now called Keelek; thence turning
Southerly at Taling-Ch'an and coming out
into what is now called Klwang Bangkok-
Yai, which empties into the river at the up-
per Fort, just below the residence of H.R.
H. Krom Hluang Wongsa.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At that time it was a day's journey, by
the river for oared boats, to row from the
palace of H. R. H. Krom Hlaung Wongsa,
to that of the second King, but the actual
distance between the two places was so
short, that the natives after spending nearly
all the day in rowing, have often walked
from the one to the other, for their rice pots
which they had left behind, and returned
with them in time to cook supper.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Near the upper fort, there was also the
mouth of a creek, which commenced at, or
near the old palace of the third King, (on
the west side of the present river, nearly
opposite to the palace of the second King)
which took a long sweep to the westward
into the fields, then turned in a southerly
direction. The lower mouth of this canal
was called Bangkok-Yai, the upper Bang-
kok-Noi, the space between was called
Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The word Bang means, canal, or creek.
The upper end of the creek and the
lower are both called Bangkok (that is,
the generic name is in both cases alike ).
Th name union of the generic and specific
name may be seen the common way of
speaking of the two ends of other canals ;
for example—the Paklet canal and the
Bang-k'rai canal. The former is called
Paklet the upper, and Paklet the lower—
The latter where it opens into the River
(above Bangkok) is called Bang-k'rul the
outer, and the mouth opening into Bang-
kok-noi river, is called Bang-k'rui the
inner. So it is in regard to Paklet canal
( which crosses a big-bend of the river
north of Bangkok) the upper end being
called Pakkret the upper, and the lower
Pakkret the lower.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It was in the reign of Maha-Chakra-P'atdi
(the 16th Siamese king) that the king was
pleased to have a large canal excavated,
connecting the two places called Bangkok-
yai and Bangkok-Noi, causing the main
body of the river to flow in this new
channel. He caused also small fortifica-
tions to be made at each of the two places.
Just as in the reign of Prabat Somdetch
P'ra Poot'a-lot-la Nop'a-lie when the
king made the canal which crosses the
neck of the big bend at the city Nak'awn
K'uan-k'an Now Nak'awn is Sanskrit,
and K'uan-K'an is Siamese. The latter
only may be written to express it. This
place is simply Paklet.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Having made fortification, at the lower
extremity of the new canal at Bangkok,
king Maha-Chakra-P'atdi gave it the name
of T'onburee.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now concerning the digging of that
canal, though it was done more than 800
years ago, there is good reason to believe
that it is a fact. In not the present chan-
nel of the river (from the palace of the
second king to that of H. R. H. Krom
Hluang) narrower, than the river imme-
diately above and below? This part is only
520 feet wide, not 650 feet. When this new
channel was finished, the waters of the
river flowed through it, and abandoned
its old course, around the big -bend which
hence gradually filled up, (by the earthy
sediment of its sluggish waters ) in some
parts full one half, in others less. When
we follow the old channel and examine it,
we find that one of the banks of it is high,
the other low, having the form of a curve
channel throughout. When this old chan-
nel had thus been changed, the two ex-
tremities of it still continued to be called
Bangkok-Noi, and Bangkok-Yai, that is
the upper end of it was called Bangkok
Noi, and the lower end Bangkok-Yai, ac-{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}cording to the original names.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Now let us examine the Bangkok-Yai
extremity, on the upper side of it by the
fort at Dr. Bradley's, on the lower side ot
Tonburee, the bank is elevated because it
was the old bank of the river; but on the
lower side of it, at Kaddee Cheen, it is low,
because it is land made by the natural ac-
tion of the old river.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This difference in the two banke, con-
tinues to be observable until got come be-
yond temple Sang-kra-chai, where the
course ot the old channel is changed.
From temple Bang-ye-rua, the low bank is
on the north side, opposite the temple.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Again examine the location of the old
temple, that were erected on what used
to be, the high bank of the old channel,
from the mouth of Bangkok-Yai to temple
Sang-kra-chai. On the low back at Kadee
Cheen, there wae to temple, because it
was then occupied by the river. The first
temple you come to on that side of the old
abannel is called Dawk-Mei, the next is
called Yai, and than temple Noi, and temple
Sang-kra-chai. These temples were anciently
situated on the high bank of the river-chan-
nel, but are now temples in the fields. When
you come to temple Bang-ye-rua, you find
an old temple on the bank of the present
channel, which is at was in ancient time.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}But on the same bank, further inward
are the temples Dea-duat and Chow-Moon,
which in ancient days must have been on
the banks ot the river, but are now inland.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The canal, at the mouth of which there is
a Custom house, is the ancient and true
Bang Hluang canal. In ancient times the
Bangkok-Yai was as large as the present
Bangkok-noi creek. But as it was nigh the
city Tonburee, the people built their houses
so made dikes encroaching upon it,
that it gradually narrowed to its present
dimensions. And at length the people, see-
ing it to be a smaller body of water than
Bangkok-noi creek, came to think that it
was not therefore proper to call it Bang-
kok-Yai (the large Bangkok) and as it had
become of equal size with Bang Hluang
creek (and continuone with it) they saw fit
to call it all by the name Bang Hluang.
But a multitude of persone acquainted with
the former state of the matter, say that the
name Bang Hluang, was given to that part
of it which anciently was called Bangkok-
Yai became Phya-Taksin erected his palace
on the present site of Prince Krom Hluang
Wongsa, which was called Wang Hluang
(the royal palace). Phya-Taksin, driving
off the original settlers on the banks of the
Bangkok-Yai near his palace, gave the lots to
his princes and oftioers of government whom
he wisjed to have near him. And persons
passing that way, were required to take
particular heed to themselves on account of
its being a thoroughfare near the king's
palace. For these reasons the came to be
called Klawng Hluang or Bang-Hluang ;
This may be illustrated by the fact that
in the reign of Phya Taksin all the Tachus
Chinese, were called Cheen Hluang ( royal
Chinese) because they were Chinese of the
same Province as Phya Taksin himself.
But in all government documenes of that
period, the creek now improperly called
Bang-Hlaung was calls Bangkok-Yai. There
can be found no instance of its having baen
otherwise denominated. The only Klawng
Bang Hluang originally mentioned is that
creek at the Temple Paknam, ( near the
Custom House at the mouth of the creek
leading to Mahachei.) All the creek be-
tween that and the present river was called
Bangkok Yai.{{< /news/text >}}

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
A visit to the Pra pra-t'omr-chedee
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
Continued from page 25.
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/text >}}We started so early from the town of
Nakawn-chei-ee, that we had scarcely a
glimpse of the place. It is but a small
village, awd would have but little impor-
tance; were it not the seat of government
for one of the most important Provinces
in Siam.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Pră prà-t’ômă-chêdée is very near-
ly due west from Nakawn-cheisée, a dis-
tance of 300 sens, by Siamese measurement
which is nearly equal to seven and a half
English miles. It is reached by a canal of
the same size and straightness, as the one
described in the preceding article, and the
country through which it passes, very much
like that we described there, being a per-
fect level prairie, with but here and there a
small forest tree. Those parts near the
canal were generally occupied for the
growth of rice, some of which looked as if
it would turn out a good yeild, on the
slopes of the canal-banks (now as the
water is low) there are very pleasant look-
ing patches of maize, onions, turnips, rad-
ishes, lettince, mustard &c.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}This canal was excavated about five
years ago, doubtless for the primary object
of making a convenient way of access to a
place, which is designed to become a very
popular shrine for the worship of Buddh,
and thus to transmit the name of His pres-
ent Majesty the Supreme King, to future gen-
erations as a sovereign of great wealth, and
of sincere devotion to Buddhism, such as
he taught, when a priest at the head of a
reformed school, and such as he has up-
held with the right hand of his kingly
power, in faithfulness to the oath he took
when he acceded to the Throne.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The original name of the Pagoda (for
such it is) was Pra-pra t'om Chotee, literally
a Pagoda of a god that slept. But for rea-
sons best known to such as have authority
to change names, a slight change has been
made in the writing of that original name,
so that it can now be literally rendered,
a Pagoda of the god of the beginning,
or the most ancient Pagoda. The change
is only in the letter O in the word pra-
t'am, which formerly had no rising inflec-
tion, but now has, and when Romanized
is written Prat'om. According to the
original name it is commonly understood
that Gaudoma or Buddha, when journey-
ing in Siam on "a certain time" slept
at that place. which idea harmonizes well
with other traditions concerning him ; — as
for example :— that he found shelter at one
time under a great shelving rock, some 10
or 15 miles east of Prabat, during a tremend-
ous storm, and that consequently from that
time to this, the ceiling and siding made by
that rock, becomes brilliant in the view of
every devoted follower of Buddha, when
looking at it, and therefore is called Pra-
Chei; — that he put one of his feet on a
smaller mount at P'rabat, and left in it his
foot print, and hence the name ; and that
he reclined on a rock, at the top of a small
mount 20 or 30 miles east of Pra-pra-
toma Chedee, and hence the place is cal-
led P'ra-t'aan,—the lounge of god.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The Pagoda on Pra-pra't'oma' Chedee,
is situated in the midst of a vast wilderness
of jungle grass, bushes, and scraggy bam-
boos, with scarcely a hill in all the field
of vision, or a large tree, and nothing to
bound the vision but the horizon. It is said
to be two and a half sens, or 400 feet high,
having been designed by its founder Phya
Kong, to be the highest point at which
doves love to make their nests. The upper
half of it, which has not been inclosed by
the new brick work now going up, is much
like the tops of some Pagoda's in Bangkok.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}It would appear that the original size of
its base was not a quarter of what it is now,
There was no possibility of measuring it,
as it was entirely hidden by the solid brick
work which has been joined to it, and which
is to be carried upward until the old is en-
tirely lost in the new work. The artificial
mound on which it stands, is a regular circle
not far from 4000 feet in circumference,
and about 15 feet high ; and the diameter
of the new work measured on that base is
about 600 feet. It has been carried up not
far from 300 feet already, gradually becom-
ing smaller as it ascends by symetrical and
tasty variations of form—now swelling out
gracefully and now sinking in, so as to
form regular zones around it.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We ascended this new work on the south
side by a flight of zigzag steps, made for the
workmen. It is more properly, a plank road
six feet wide, with strips of scantling spi-
ked to the plank crosswise for steps. We
came down on the north side by a similar
path, made it would seam, for the special
accommodation of the king and royal retinue
in their annual and semiannual visitations.
This flight of steps has a firm bamboo rail.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}ing attached to it, which, is no doubt at the
times of such visitations, wound up nearly
with a white bandage the whole of his length
for the hand of the King to grasp as he
ascends and descends. The top of the new
work is upward of 300 feet in circumfer-
ence. Radiating from the old spire to the
chief points of the compass, there are heavy
four inch planks laid flat-wise, upon which
the work is to be built up; and we were
informed that several such strains of timber
had been placed in the brick work below
as there would be above ; — the object be-
ing to prevent the work from splitting.
Such an accident occurred four or five years
since when the structure had arisen to
nearly its present height. While many
men were at work on the top of it, it sud-
denly parted from the old spire on all hands
and came down with a great crash; and
marvellous to say, so great was the merit
of working upon it, that it is reported that
only one of the men was killed by the
accident. The confused mound made by
this avalanche was at length levelled down,
and now forms the mound above described.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}The view from the top of this new struc-
ture commands a prairie district of great
extent, which is now an arid wilderness
of the common jungle productions of all the
vast plains of Siam. Here and there
could be seen small plots of cultivated land
and round about them a few grass thatched
huts indicating poverty. We could see
nothing that looked like a canal or water
privilege of any kind.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the time we took our observations
from that point, midway between the earth
and the top of P'ra pra-t'ôm Chedée, the
air was rather smoky and the sky cloudy,
which circumscribed our view much from
what it would have been in a clear time.
Judging from observations made near Prả
t'áan, some years since, we think that it
should be in sight by means of a glass from
this place. Lying, as it probably does, a little
North of West. It is on a little mount in
a slightly elevated district, abounding with
the timber, called Mai teng rang, which
is in great repute for the pillars of houses,
and from which the rosin of this country is
obtained.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}At the base of this pagoda are being
erected a circle of very tasty and expensive
buildings with splendid porches, guarded by
huge figures of Nak, a kind of demi-god. At
the northern entrance is a small artificial
mountain with a great variety of caverns,
and subterranean recesses, on the exterior
of which are sundry pools of water, little
pagodas, and miniature temples. On the
west side is a reclining god in the process of
formation under the plastic hands of two
masons, which may be 50 feet in length
and otherwise duly proportioned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}In the immediate vicinity of the Pagoda
are fifteen or twenty small brick houses,
ill after the same model, of recent make,
designed for the accommodation of Buddhist
priests. On either side of the canal, which
comes to its terminus a few feet from the
Pagoda, are twenty or more substantial
brick sazats some fifty rods apart, built but
recently for the shelter of pilgrims coming
to worship Buddah at this his sacred lodging
place.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}His Majesty, the Supreme King, is having
a little palace erected a few rods from the
Pagoda on the East side, for his own con-
venience and pleasure when he comes hith-
er to consecrate all these new works to the
Buddhist religion, and to lead the devotions
of his great family at this rising shrine.
We observed, that among other numerous
buildings, connected with the palace, was
the usual accompaniment every where seen
in the royal residences in city or in country
—a large place for theatrical performances;
for such plays are quite in harmony with
the modern worship of Buddah.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}An incalculable amount of treasure has
been already expended upon this Pagoda,
and all the other works connected with it;
and many hundreds of thousands of Ticals
will be required to complete all that has
been laid out to be done.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}There is in sight from the top of the new
Pagoda, several miles to the S. E., another
ancient pagoda called Pra pra t'one which
from the present appearance of things, will
not be allowed long to remain without some
extraordinary honors being conferred upon
it by His Majesty the King.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Would that the king could see how much
better for his own name, and for his own
subjects, and for the future generations of
his own people, it would be to employ this
great wealth, for the complete exploration
and survey of all his dominions, that their
vast hidden treasures might be brought to
light, their rivers all accurately mapped,
their towns, cities, and provinces, all clearly
bounded, and railways and electric tele-
graphs, bringing them all into close prox-
imity with the great metropolis, and the
whole into lightning communication with
all the western kingdoms and nations.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}We remained at Pra pra-t'om chedee
only about two hours, as we found it very
uncomfortably hot and confined, for our
children in the boat, at low water in a deep
ditch of a canal, with the merest sham of
a market from which to replenish our table,
and no house on shore offering the least
comfort to such visitors in such a " dry and
thirsty land." Having talked a little to the
people, who came to look in upon us from
the top of a high flight of steps leading to
our boat, and given them a few tracts, and
portions of the Eternal Word, we took our
leave of them to return to the Tacheen river,
which we reached about sunset. We had
intended to proceed onw in to the Sugar
district that night, but were obliged to
give up the hopes of it, and put up for the
night after having pushed against a strong
upward tide till 9 P. M.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}And now Mr. Editor, as it seems probable
that the strong tide of my thoughts the next
day would be quite to much for the present
number, I will postpone the many things
of great interest I observed there, for a
place in some future issue.{{< /news/text >}}

FROM THE HOME NEWS.

{{< news/subheading2 >}}
AMERICA.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}The news from America, which is up to
the evening of the 28th of Dec, is of great
importance. On the 20th Sherman cap-
tured Fort Lee and some of the outworks
of Savannah. He then demanded the surren-
der of Savannah stating that if refused, he
would take no prisoners. Hardee refused
to surrender. During the night of the 20th,
Hardee escaped with the main body of his
army by crossing the Savannah River, at
Union Causeway leading to Charleston, af-
ter destroying the ironclads and navy yards.
Sherman occupied the city on the 21st,
capturing 150 guns, 13(1 cars, 8 small
steamers, 30,000 bales of cotton, 800 pris-
oners, and a large quantity of ammunition.
Twenty thousand inhabitants remained in
the city. The value of the captured cotton
is estimated at £ 8,000,000 ; it is believed
to belong to foreigners.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}General Beauregard announced from
Charleston, under date of the 25th, that
Sherman had sent a column southward from
Savannah, probably to destroy the Savannah,
Albany, and Gulf Railway, but that Har-
dee had made dispositions to check the
movement.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nashville advices to the 23rd of December
state that Hood's army had reached Pulaski,
75 miles south of Nashville, on the 22nd,
closely followed by the Federal cavalry.
Forrest, with his entire command, joined
Hood's on the 21st at Columbia. Hood is
reported to have a pontoon a bridge over the
Tennessee River near Florence, above the
reach of the Federal gunboats. Thomas's
headquarters are near Columbia, and his
army is south of the Duck River. Hood
said to have lost at least 17,000 men, and
24 guns, since he retreated. His retreat is re-
ported to have been very precipitate and
disorderly, the country being filled with
deserters stragglers from his army.
On the 25rd, it was reported that Hood's
army had retreated still further. He was
moving to strike the Tennessee River at
Bainbridge, near Florence. On that day a
portion of Thomas's force was repulsed in
an attack upon Hood's rearguard with
considerable loss in men and two cannon.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Nashville despatches assert that the high 
state of the river would impede Hood's
crossing the Tennessee.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Full particulars of Sherman's great march
have now appeared in the New York papers,
and the following is given as a summary of
its results: —" His army moved across the
State about 300 miles, in 27 days, living on
the way on the fat of the land, devastating
43 counties, stripping the country of every-
thing that could be of service to the rebel
armies, destroying 200 miles of railroad,
burning millions of dollars' worth of cotton,
capturing 4000 prisoners, 10,000 negroes,
15,000 horses, and 30 pieces of artillery;
and immediately on arriving on the coast
wrested Fort M'Alister from the enemy,
and laid seige to the city of Savannah. In
the performance of all this marvellous work
General Sherman lost not one gun or
wagon, and his entire casualties were only
1500 men.{{< /news/text >}}

DESCRIPTION OF THE STOCKADE
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/centre >}}
In which the Federal Prisoners were
confined at Andersonville Ga.
From New York Times
{{< /news/centre >}}
{{< news/separator >}}
{{< news/text >}}The stockade or pen in which the
prisoners at Andersonville are confined, it
appears from the statement, is an enclosure
of fourteen acres, five of which were a
morass. Here the men were without
shelter, and in many instances almost
naked, huddled together without room
for exercise. During the last Summer
months there were scattered about in this
pen, an average of at least 500 prisoners,
who were suffering from disease in almost
every form incident to man, in a climate
to which he is unaccustomed. Five acres of
the surface of the ground were covered with
human excrement, exhaling a morbific in-
fluence which would prove fatal even to
the rice plantation laborer, accustomed
from infancy to breathing the malarious
atmosphere of his native swamplands. Con-
stantly drenched by rains receiving bad
food, always barely prepared and often
raw, in many instances naked and laboring
under a mental depression verging upon
melancholy,  feeling that their days were
numbered, the prisoners were kept in their
dreadful prison. Under these circumstances
the mortality became frightful, and as a
matter of defence from an epidemic, the
rebel authorities were compelled to thin
out the shambles early in September, by
sending several thousand of the prisoners
to a new stockade established at Savannah,
where their sufferings were considerably
alleviated. Subsequently these men on
the breaking out of the yellow fever, at
Savannah, were removed lo another prison
pen at Milan. Before the change from
Andersonville was made, eleven thousand
victims had been buried, uncoffined, in
the shallow trenches near the prison.{{< /news/text >}}

FROM GALIGNANI'S MESSENGER.
{{< /news/subheading2 >}}
{{< news/text >}}Private letters from Saigon, of the 6th
Oct., give the following details of the situ-
ation of affairs in Cochin-China:—{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}"Rear Admiral de la Grandiere, the Gov-
ernor and Coinmander in cheif, has promul-
gated a decree on the organisation of justice
in the French possessions in Cochin-China.
That document is founded upon the most
liberal principles, it creates French and
native tribunals, and authorizes the publicity
of the proceedings in civil and criminal
matter. It has produced an excellent im-
pression on the population who, consider
as the most serious and complete guar-
antee for their interests.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}They see in it also a proof that the Au-
baret treaty will be ratified, and that none
of the provinces now belonging to France
will be abandoned.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Another favorable incident has just taken
place. The administration has effected at
Cholen the first sale of lands belonging to
the State. It took care before commencing
those auctions, to verify very minutely the
tenure of the natives, and to recognize all
legitimate right. This praiseworthy act
has had for result, to attract a great num-
ber of Chinese, and Annamite proprietors to
the spot. The biddings at the sales were
animated, and the average price obtained
was seven piastres a metre, which has pro-
duced a considerable sum to the public treas-
ury.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}Cholen is a very important commercial
and manufacturing centre. The town is
situated at a short distance from Saigon,
and is inhabited by a very rich Chinese mer-
chants, who are about to construct num-
erous buildings, and at their own expense
erect a Bourse, a Tribunal of Commerce,
and an Entrepot for merchandise. A very
useful establishment has just beeninau gua-
ted—-the Anamite hospital of Cho-Quan,
situated between Saigon and Cholen which
will render very great services to the natives.
It is by foundations of this kind that France
will more and more attach the natives to
her. The Sisters of Saint Paul de Chartres
nurse the sick, and nothing can exceed the
profound veneration which the natives have
for them. The establishment of Cho-Quan
is one of the most popular institutions in
Cochin-China. Hospitals of the same kind
are about to be established in the other pro-
vinces.{{< /news/text >}}

I trample on the pride of Plato." "True," said

{{< news/text >}}Nothing in it-—A coxcomb, teasing Dr. Parr

ical inconvenience and weariness.{{< /news/text >}}
{{< news/text >}}A young man went from New York city to the
West, where he commenced business on his own ac-
count, and married. His friends in the city were
interested in his welfare; and when a merchant was
about to journey to the place where the young man
was located, he was requested to visit the emigrant,
and ascertain how he lived, and what sort of a wife
he had chosen,—-his prospects, &c. Accordingly the
New Yorker ascertained the residence of his young
friend, and called quite early in the morning. The
introduction of the New Yorker to his wife was quite
off hand and unceremonious, and he was requested
to be seated and partake of the morning meal. The
young wife had prepared the steak, biscuit, and
coffee with her own hands, and for a table had used
her kneading board, over which a napkin was spread
and, the “board” placed on her lap. The New
Yorker declined a seat at the table and took his leave.
On making his report to his New York friends as to
how he found his young friends living, he described
the style as “magnificent;” and for the explanation
of the superlative he said, that were he the owner of
the young man’s furniture he would not take
$10,000 for the legs of his table.{{< /news/text >}}
