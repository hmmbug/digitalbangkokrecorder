The Bangkok Recorder began to be published in a second phase between 1865 and 1867, two decades later than the 
[first phase](/publications/bangkok_recorder_thai_1844_1845/) and under more liberal conditions. It was written 
and published by Dr. Dan Beach Bradley and N. A. McDonald.

* **Language & Format:** The Thai-language edition was produced alongside its [English counterpart](/publications/bangkok_recorder_english_1865_1867/), making it one of the earliest regularly printed Thai newspapers. It used a two-column layout and was physically smaller than the English version. The first English editions contained a small number of Thai language articles but after a few months the newspapers were separated into monolingual English and Thai editions.

* **Content & Context:** The Thai edition shared local news, commentary, and general topics with its readers during the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV), when Siam was engaging more with Western ideas. Although it provided information about current events and broader subjects> Financial difficulties and mixed reception among subscribers led to its eventual end in early 1867.

* **Legacy:** The Bangkok Recorder laid the foundation of modern Thai journalism and public discourse. As one of the earliest sustained Thai-language newspapers, it introduced regular news reporting, editorials, and the idea of print as a medium for social debate to a Siamese readership. It helped familiarize Thai society with Western concepts of journalism, rational inquiry, and public opinion during the period of reforms under King Mongkut (Rama IV), promoting Western science and education, expanding diplomacy and trade, supporting printing and the press, and starting administrative reforms that helped preserve the country’s independence. Although short-lived, the newspaper set important precedents in language, format, and intellectual openness that influenced later Thai publications and marked a transition from traditional court chronicles to modern mass communication in Thailand.
