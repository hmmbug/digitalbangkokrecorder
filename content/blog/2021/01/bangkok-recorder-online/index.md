This project has now been in progress (on and off) for four years during which time I've moved home four times across two continents, changed job multiple times and learned to play two more musical instruments (albeit not very well).

![Bangkok Recorder July 1844 Front Page](/blog/2021/01/bangkok-recorder-online/page-1844-07-sml.png#floatright) The first [1844 editions of the Bangkok Recorder](/publications/bangkok_recorder_1844_1845/) have been republished online, starting with the first four editions: July to October 1844.

The remaining 1844-45 editions will follow soon. They're nearly ready, just needing a few tweaks before upload, and should be online by the end of this month (January 2021).

The 1844-45 editions are just 56 pages but the next challenge, the 1865-67 editions, will be the considerably larger at 520 pages. And there's more than twice that in the Siam Times! All these are scanned and waiting to be processed but I'll need to develop a set of tools for online collaboration for to get that done.
