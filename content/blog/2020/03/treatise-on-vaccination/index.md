Smallpox was rife throughout Siam and returned every year, affecting much of
the population -- Dr Bradley himself lost his daughter to it. He worked on a
vaccination and documented his efforts in his treatise of 1844.

The complete "[Treatise on Vaccination](/publications/treatise_on_vaccination/)" has been transcribed from scans of the original documents and published on this site.

To give some context to the document, inoculation had been practised in Siam
before Bradley's arrival with the Chinese, Indians and Europeans having their
own methods for it. Terwiel [1] gives a detailed account of the history of
these practises and a balanced account Bradley's role in the vaccination
campaigns from the 1830s and into the mid-1840s.

An English translation of the treatise by [Pearson](http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2011/JSS_104_0h_Bradley_TreatiseOnSmallpoxVaccination.pdf) [2] was printed in 2016
and available online.
