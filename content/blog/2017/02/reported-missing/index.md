Keen-eyed readers of the PDF of the [Huntrakun](http://dl.parliament.go.th/bitstream/handle/lirt/296974/2536_สมหมาย_ฮุนตระกูล_b.pdf) collection of the Bangkok Recorder may have noticed there are a few pages missing: pages 169 and 170 have been mistakenly replaced with copies of pages 461 and 462.

Fortunately this mistake is only present in the PDF version of the book, not the original. Here are the original pages 169 and 170 scanned directly from the print edition.
