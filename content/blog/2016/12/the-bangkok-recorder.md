Wikipedia introduces the The Bangkok Recorder as:

> The Bangkok Recorder (Thai: หนังสือจดหมายเหตุ) was the first Thai-language newspaper, first published monthly, and later bi-weekly, in Bangkok, Siam between 1844–1845, and 1865-1867. It was written and published by Dr. Dan Beach Bradley, an American Christian missionary who spent 35 years in the country.

This blog aims to chronicle the digitisation of this valuable language and historical resource. Overall, there are 60 surviving editions of the newspaper and a facsimile collection was published in 1994 and this project will attempt to digitise this file.
